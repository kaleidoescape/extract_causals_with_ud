It is covered by a membrane that is normally bathed in amniotic fluid. After birth, cutting the cord physically and symbolically separates the mother and her baby. The cord stump dries and falls off, and the wound heals [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] estimates that a quarter of the world's neonatal deaths are due to infection; 75% of these occur in the first week of life, with the umbilical cord being the gateway [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The umbilical cord is an important bacterial colonisation site. A possible consequence of bacterial colonisation is cord stump infection, a factor that can greatly increase morbidity and mortality. The risk of infection increases until the stump detaches [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The newborn&#x02019;s skin and umbilical cord begin to colonise with saprophytic bacteria provided by the mother through skin contact [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The umbilical cord is colonised by microorganisms of the vagina, skin, and hands of the birth attendant. Umbilical cord rot becomes an excellent growing medium for microbial flora [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Omphalitis is an infection of the umbilical cord stump. Tracking bacteria along the umbilical vessels may lead to septicaemia, which can result in neonatal morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The average age of presentation of omphalitis is the third or fourth day of life of the newborn [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Omphalitis can be extremely serious, causing sepsis, due to the permeability of the umbilical vessels that persists until approximately 20 days of age of the newborn [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Prevention of this disease and its associated neonatal mortality is of great public health importance [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The exact incidence of cord infections is unknown. They appear to be relatively rare in developed countries, but they are probably under-reported [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Overall, omphalitis risk varies substantially and depends on the level of direct and indirect exposures to the stump (e.g., absence of hand washing and other hygiene practices by carers), variation in definition, standardisation, and frequency of measurement [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Estimated that the incidence of omphalitis in newborns in developed countries is around 0.7% and rises to 6&#x02013;8% in developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Even with the low incidence of omphalitis, the open wound of the umbilical stump remains an entry point for pathogenic bacteria, and the undetached cord stump often worries mothers. Rapid healing of the cord is an important aspect of infection prevention [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The dry care method (&#x02018;keep clean and dry&#x02019;) using only soap and water for umbilical cord care has been recommended by the WHO [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This recommendation is still in force today.</p><p>According to the National Institute of Health Care and Excellence guidelines, parents should be advised how to keep the umbilical cord clean and dry and that antiseptics should not be used routinely [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Dry care may be as effective and practical as antiseptics. Furthermore, dry care would be less expensive for healthy newborns in hospital settings in high-income countries. In the same vein are the recommendations of the American Academy of Paediatrics [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the Spanish Association of Paediatrics and Standards Commission of the Spanish Society of Neonatology. These organizations also claim that only water, soap, and drying afterward are necessary for umbilical cord care; the application of antiseptic solutions can delay the separation of the umbilical cord and does not provide any benefit [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In high-income countries, where mortality is very low, important outcomes should include infections that occur in the first month of life, maternal satisfaction, and the time it takes for the cord to separate. There is good reason to conduct a study on the least expensive interventions available without specific topical umbilical cord care. Much of the concern of mothers and health professionals relates to uncertainty about the normal process of drying and detachment of the umbilical cord, including its appearance and the smell of decaying tissue [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Lack of knowledge leads families and professionals to use antiseptics for umbilical cord care frequently.</p><p>The main objective of this research is to analyse the natural separation process of the umbilical cord with dry care and its associated factors in order to determine the mean separation time of the umbilical cord of newborns, to know the incidence of omphalitis and other associated complications in the newborns&#x02019; first month of life, and to determine what factors predict cord separation time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Study design</title><p>A quantitative longitudinal observational analytical study was conducted to explore the umbilical cord separation time, predictors, and healing complications from birth until the newborn was one month old.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Setting and sampling</title><p>The participants were newborns in the public health system of the province of Ja&#x000e9;n in southern Spain. In public hospitals of the province of Ja&#x000e9;n, there were a total of 4,739 births in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], distributed as follows: south area, 1,979 (41.76%); western area, 514 (10.85%); eastern area, 1,216 (25.66%); and northern area, 1,030 (21.73%). The number of births from high-risk obstetric pregnancies in the same year in the province of Ja&#x000e9;n was 904, so the reference population is 3,835.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: Newborns who were between 35 and 42 weeks of gestation; who had their umbilical cord cured with water and soap and dried later; and whose mothers were over the age of 18, enjoyed a low-risk pregnancy, and consented to participate in the study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: Newborns with umbilical canalization and language barrier with the mother of the newborn.</p><p>A stratified random sample was adopted. To identify the population and select the unit of analysis, a list of pregnant women attending the ultrasound consultation at 33 weeks of gestation was used. Pregnant women were selected randomly and equitably on a monthly basis. After the literature review, we established an error of no more than seven hours in the estimate of a mean separation time and assumed a standard deviation of 37.42 hours; for a population size of 2,619 with correction for finite populations (95% confidence interval, bilateral) a total of 105 neonates would need to be included in the study. First, a probabilistic selection was carried out by clusters of the sample, where the hospitals were selected in the first stage. In the second stage, we selected the mother&#x02013;newborn binomial to be measured, and a proportional sample stratification was carried out through fh: n/N = ksh [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The eastern-area hospital did not meet the inclusion criteria, because it cares for the cord with alcohol solution, so it was eliminated from the study.</p><p>After selecting the participants, researchers informed them about the study through a personal pre-birth visit. Participants signed an informed consent document, and researchers provided a &#x02018;reminder sticker&#x02019; so they would not forget to tell them the day they went into labour.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Measures</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Dependent variables</title><p><underline>Umbilical cord separation time.</underline> Is time when the umbilical cord naturally separates from the infant; measured in minutes from the time of birth to the time of complete separation of the newborn's umbilical cord, by the lead researcher (midwife).</p><p><underline>Healing complications</underline>.

The process was comprised of two blocks:</p><p><underline>From birth to the time of separation of the umbilical cord</underline>. There were three visits to the newborn: First visit: at the hospital, within the first 12 hours of the newborn's birth; the lead researcher (midwife) collected clinical data from the delivery process and the newborn and performed a clinical evaluation of the umbilical cord and measurement of its external diameter. Second visit: at the family home, three days after birth; the same researcher monitored the umbilical cord clinically with special consideration of the evaluation criteria of omphalitis and care for the umbilical cord. Third visit: at the family home, two days after umbilical cord separation; once again, the same researcher monitored the umbilical cord clinically, paid attention to the occurrence of complications in the healing process, and collected data about how many times the cord got wet and the umbilical cord separation time.</p><p><underline>From cord separation to the first month of life of the newborn</underline>. Monitoring of the evolution of the healing process. The mothers were previously instructed in writing about the warning signs and normality. The researcher contacted the mothers of the newborns weekly by telephone for information and photos of the umbilicus of the newborns.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A univariate descriptive analysis of frequencies and percentages was performed for qualitative variables such as the occurrence of complications in healing, and the baseline characteristics of participants, including socio-demographic and clinical information, were summarised (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227209.s001">S1 File</xref>). The mean, standard deviation, and median were used to determine the cord separation time and other quantitative variables.</p><p>A bivariate analysis was performed to compare dependent and independent variables and dependent endpoints with each other. Diagnosis of normality was previously made through the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test to determine the use of parametric or nonparametric tests. To determine the association between different umbilical cord care and cord separation time and to determine the association between umbilical cord separation time and socio-demographic and clinical variables, the Student's t, Mann&#x02013;Whitney-U, and Rho-Spearman tests were used, depending on the hypothesis contrast. To contrast the association between the cord separation time and cord diameter, the R-Pearson test was used. To measure the association among different umbilical cord care, socio-demographic and clinical variables, and healing complications, depending on the hypothesis contrast, the following were used: Fisher exact test, simple binary logistic regression, and Chi Square test.</p><p>A multivariate analysis using multiple linear regression was carried out to determine the predictors of umbilical cord separation time. The independent variables were operationalised, according to requirements of coding the independent variables in multiple regression models, and the polytomous independent variables were established as dummy variables. The continuous independent variables were maintained with the original numerical value, and the dichotomous variables was coded as 1 and 0. The backward stepwise regression method was used in this study. We included in the analysis those variables that correlated in the bivariate analysis and the variables recommended by the literature. The precaution was not to include an excessive number of variables according to sample size [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Diagnostic testing of the model was performed, and the following criteria were met: independence of residues: Durbin&#x02013;Watson; residue normality: Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov residue; linearity: seen with partial regression graphs; homoscedasticity: graph of standardised residue; non-collinearity: variance inflation factor and tolerance.

In this study, diagnosis of the model was made by independence of residues (Durbin&#x02013;Watson = 1.998). The residues were independent (residue normality: Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov residue: p value = 0.447), indicating normality. Linearity was seen with partial regression graphs, which showed linearity. Regarding homoscedasticity, the graph showed standardised residue, which did not have any standard.

In terms of birth weight, similar results were obtained by other authors, who reported that cord separation time increased with increasing birth weight, but, as in our study, the effect size was low [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In contrast, in some studies, multiple regression analysis showed no significant effect of birth weight on the time to umbilical cord separation [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

Regarding the administration of intrapartum antibiotics, our results indicate that their use delays the cord separation time. It is known that these antibiotics given to the mother will continue to be present in the amniotic fluid and umbilical blood [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

Only one study has been found that considers umbilical cord separation time according to the season of the year, which concludes that in spring the cord takes less time to detach [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the area where that study was conducted, spring weather conditions are similar to summer in our geographical area. Our results indicated that umbilical cord separation time increased in spring, while it is true that the mean cord separation time in our research is shorter in summer than in the rest of the seasons, but these differences were not statistically significant. Neonates with Apgar scores of 7&#x02013;8 one minute after birth have longer separation times than those with a higher score; these results coincide with other authors [<xref rid="pone.0227209.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], who show that neonates with a 10-min Apgar score of 10 had a significantly shorter cord separation time than those with an Apgar score &#x0003c; 10.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Conclusions and implications</title><p>The WHO in developed countries recommends dry cord care together with the use of soap and water when the cord is soiled, and our findings support these recommendations. Dry umbilical cord care is a safe practice that soon detaches the umbilical cord, taking into account the factors studied that will vary the length of time until the umbilical cord is separated. The profile of a newborn with the fastest cord separation time would be the one who gets wet the least, the one with an Apgar score &#x0003e; 8 at birth, the one whose mother does not receive intrapartum antibiotics, the one who is not born in spring, and the one who has a smaller weight at birth. Nevertheless, it is necessary to assess whether the increased incidence of omphalitis may be due to increased diagnostic sensitivity or a real problem in clinical practice.</p><p>The major practical application is family intervention that will consist of health education on the factors influencing umbilical cord detachment, especially wetting recurrence, where caregivers can intervene. Moreover, pointing out that the most frequent complication is umbilical granuloma would help to reduce the anxiety of families and professionals about the natural process of umbilical cord separation, in terms of healing characteristics and separation time. Increasing confidence in the practice of dry cord care contributes to the social learning of the unnecessary application of products for umbilical cord healing in developed countries.</p><p>Future lines of research would be to replicate the study in similar contexts in order to carry out a cross-validation of the multiple linear regression model and thus be able to make forecasts. At the same time, by increasing the sample, potentially unknown predictors can be highlighted that may affect umbilical cord separation time. Additionally, qualitative studies are recommended to explore the satisfaction and fears of the newborns' families with the dry cord care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227209.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Dataset.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227209.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227209.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Zupan</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Garner</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Omari</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Topical umbilical cord care at birth</article-title>. <source>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</source>. <year>2004</year>; <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/14651858.CD001057.pub2</pub-id>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript prospectively studies the separation time of umbilical cord stump and risk for infection with routine soap and water/dry cord care. The current standard of care and recommendation from major clinical centers (NIH and AAP) supports soap and water/dry cord care, but parents still use antiseptic treatments because of lack of confidence with these recommendations. The authors chose to study this issue prospectively and compare their rates of infection and other complications. This topic has been extensively investigated before by other groups but this group effectively describe their concerns about parental refusal to believe these recommendations. Studying this issue in their region could help the doctors in that region families to follow the stated guidelines.</p><p>The manuscript is written well, easy to read, the English is excellent. The authors represent the time of separation is different ways in the abstract vs manuscript which was a bit confusing (I would recommend using days rather than seconds).</p><p>Overall, on first read this didn't appear to add more to the literature given that the evidence for the stated guidelines is strong, but perhaps the study using regional factors will help guide care and improve understanding of the mistrust of families of their study population.</p><p>Reviewer #2: There are several areas that require revision for minor grammatical errors. For example, the World Health Organization is written as both the World Health Organization and the World Health Organisation. In addition, some of the phrasing is a little awkward, especially when using passive voice.</p><p>In the introduction, there is a nice argument to support the importance of this research due to the large public health concern of neonatal infection. In particular, omphalitis can have considerable morbidity and mortality, a risk that increases if the umbilical cord remains attached and theoretically is then reduced if the umbilical cord detaches more quickly. This is seen in line 66 and 67. Consider including the reference for this statement that connects the time of umbilical cord attachment and increased risk of omphalitis, especially if there is any statistical information where a particular length of time increases the risk of omphalitis by a known amount. This would help further support the overall clinical importance of this research because even though the time of cord separation was statistically different in some cases this might not result in a clinically significant length of time to the neonate. For example, though there is a clear statistical difference of about 2 days between the groups of neonates whose umbilical cords became wet 0-4 times vs. &#x0003e;5 times, does 2 days make a clinical significance to these children? However, if the aim was merely to show that the clean and dry method is both safe and financially sound then the current information provided would be sufficient.</p><p>Please discuss the training or role of the researcher who is taking the measurements for the umbilical cord and providing a clinical assessment/ possible diagnosis of omphalitis. Are they a physician? Nurse?</p><p>In line 151, please provide the definition that the paper uses for late separation of the umbilical cord.</p><p>On page 8, within the socio-demographic and clinical newborn variables, please list gestational age as a length of weeks and days. For example, 40 weeks and 0 days instead of 280 days.</p><p>Finally, please state clearly that the umbilical cord separation time of interest in your research is the time when the umbilical cord naturally separates from the infant. This will clear up any questions that the reader might have when reading the title or abstract and wondering if the authors meant the time of clamping the cord from the mother at birth (delayed cord clamping) or something even more extreme such as the lotus birth where the placenta is never clamped and remains attached to the infant for several days.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Reviewers' comments:</p><p>&#x02022; Reviewer #1: </p><p>-Comment 1: &#x0201c;The authors chose to study this issue prospectively and compare their rates of infection and other complications. This topic has been extensively investigated before by other groups but this group effectively describe their concerns about parental refusal to believe these recommendations. Studying this issue in their region could help the doctors in that region families to follow the stated guidelines&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 1:</p><p>The study population is reluctant to change, most of the research available in the scientific literature is from other regions, and this study will help us provide evidence-based care and improve understanding of the mistrust of families in our study area. </p><p>-Comment 2: &#x0201c;The authors represent the time of separation is different ways in the abstract vs manuscript which was a bit confusing (I would recommend using days rather than seconds)&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 2:</p><p>Umbilical cord separation time changed in the manuscript and in the abstract using days, to make it understandable.</p><p>&#x02022; Reviewer #2: </p><p>-Comment 1: &#x0201c;The World Health Organization is written as both the World Health Organization and the World Health Organisation&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 1: </p><p>Corrected grammatical errors; the World Health Organization name changed and others minor grammatical errors.</p><p>-Comment 2: &#x0201c;some of the phrasing is a little awkward, especially when</p><p>using passive voice&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 2: </p><p>Modified part of the phrasing from passive voice to simple past in the manuscript:</p><p> o Line 72: Omphalitis is an infection of the umbilical cord stump.</p><p> o Line 83-85: Estimated that the incidence of omphalitis in newborns in developed countries is around 0.7% and rises </p><p> to 6&#x02013;8% in developing countries.</p><p> o Line 159-162: The different actions carried out in the dry umbilical cord care: how often the umbilical cord gets wet, </p><p> pH of soap used, type of bath for neonates, wearing a garment that tightens the newborn's body, placing the </p><p> newborn's diaper under the umbilical cord, and covering the umbilical cord with clean gauze.</p><p> o Line 169: In table 1, we can see the independent secondary variables of the studied population.</p><p> o Line 225-226: Ja&#x000e9;n Research Ethics Committee (26 November 2015) approved the study.</p><p> o Line 261: In table 3, we can see the correlation between umbilical cord care and separation time.</p><p> o Line 407-408: other authors obtained similar results [30].</p><p> o Line 417-418: Literature supports the umbilical cord separation time predictors reported by our research.</p><p>-Comment 3: &#x0201c;In particular, omphalitis can have considerable morbidity and mortality, a risk that increases if the umbilical cord remains attached and theoretically is then reduced if the umbilical cord detaches more quickly. This is seen in line 66 and 67. Consider including the reference for this statement that connects the time of umbilical cord attachment and increased risk of omphalitis, especially if there is any statistical information where a particular length of time increases the risk of omphalitis by a known amount. This would help further support the overall clinical importance of this research because even though the time of cord separation was statistically different in some cases this might not result in a clinically significant length of time to the neonate&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 3:</p><p>We have added a reference to lines 66-68. A possible consequence of bacterial colonisation is cord stump infection, a factor that can greatly increase morbidity and mortality. The risk of infection increases until the stump detaches [4].</p><p>-Comment 4: &#x0201c;For example, though there is a clear statistical difference of about 2 days between the groups of neonates whose umbilical cords became wet 0-4 times vs. &#x0003e;5 times, does 2 days make a clinical significance to these children? However, if the aim was merely to show that the clean and dry method is both safe and financially sound then the current information provided would be sufficient&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 4:</p><p>We provide this information to know the factors involved in the procedure of the fall of the umbilical cord. There are no statistical data in the scientific literature to support our results. </p><p>-Comment 5: &#x0201c;Please discuss the training or role of the researcher who is taking the measurements for the umbilical cord and providing a clinical assessment/</p><p>possible diagnosis of omphalitis. Are they a physician? Nurse?&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 5: </p><p>We specify in several parts of the article who does the clinical assessment (line 150,156,178).</p><p>-Comment 6: &#x0201c;In line 151, please provide the definition that the paper uses for late separation of the umbilical cord&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 6:</p><p>In line 151 (actually 153-156) we add a bibliographic reference that provides the definition for late umbilical cord separation.</p><p>-Comment 7: &#x0201c;On page 8, within the socio-demographic and clinical newborn variables, please list gestational age as a length of weeks and days. For example, 40 weeks and 0 days instead of 280 days&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 7:</p><p>On page 8 we change the duration of gestational age to express it in weeks and days.</p><p>-Comment 8: &#x0201c;State clearly that the umbilical cord separation time of interest in your research is the time when the umbilical cord naturally separates from the infant. This will clear up any questions that the reader might have when reading the title or abstract and wondering if the authors meant the time of clamping the cord from the mother at birth (delayed cord clamping) or something even more extreme such as the lotus birth where the placenta is never clamped and remains attached to the infant for several days&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0fffd;Response 8:</p><p>In Line 148, 149 we add the definition of umbilical cord separation time: Umbilical cord separation time. Is time when the umbilical cord naturally separates from the infant.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227209.s002"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227209.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0227209.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227209.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Palatnik</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Anna Palatnik</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Anna Palatnik</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0227209" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
