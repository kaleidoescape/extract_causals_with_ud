MI is a syndrome of myocardial cell necrosis, which is caused by severe and persistent ischemia and hypoxia of the local myocardium induced by coronary artery occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is well known that myocardial ischemia exacerbates the pathological damage of MI through impairing ischemic vascular remodeling and collateral formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, inhibition of myocardial apoptosis and promotion of angiogenesis are of great importance for the treatment of ischemic heart disease such as MI. Although the current therapeutic strategy of MI has greatly improved the clinical symptoms and reduced the mortality of patients, the rates of coronary restenosis and graft failure, along with vascular occlusion is still relatively high, they fail to repair the necrotic heart tissues, and avoid the occurrence of myocardial remodeling after MI, which seriously affects the prognosis of MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, oral drugs and other non-invasive therapies are still the first choice and complementary invasive therapies to ameliorate blood flow of ischemic heart tissues.</p><p id="Par24">Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase and is one of the largest protein kinase families in organism. Some studies have shown that myocardial ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury and MI can activate CaMKII via oxidation and phosphorylation, which resulting in myocardial fibrosis, inflammation, apoptosis and necrosis, and eventually leading to heart failure and arrhythmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, CaMKII plays a key role in maintaining myocardial structure and function, as well as in cardiac contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, down-regulation of CaMKII activity is an important target for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.</p><p id="Par25">Huoxue Wentong Formula (HXWTF) originated from Danshen Yin and has been modified appropriately, which has the effects of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, invigorating qi and relieving pain. In the previous small sample clinical study, we observed that the symptoms of myocardial ischemia significantly improved after treatment with HXWTF for 4&#x000a0;weeks. However, the specific therapeutic mechanism of HXWTF remains elusive. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the angiogenic function and anti-apoptotic effect of HXWTF in the ischemic heart and hypoxia/serum deprivation (H/SD)-treated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) or H9c2 cells and to reveal HXWTF promoting cardiac angiogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis are related to CaMKII oxidation and phosphorylation activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and surgery</title><p id="Par26">All the animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Guang&#x02019;anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (IACUC-GAMH-2019-005). Ten to twelve-week-old male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) and reared in a standard experimental animal laboratory with free access to food and water. Rats were anesthetized and subjected to ischemia by the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation as previous reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Ischemic heart tissues were evaluated by electrocardiography (ECG). After operation, rats were randomly divided into six groups: (1) Sham group (without coronary artery ligation); (2) Model group (coronary artery ligation); (3) Positive group (model rats treated with 6.3&#x000a0;mg/kg isosorbide mononitrate sustained-release tablets); (4&#x02013;6) HXWTF1, HXWTF2, and HXWTF3 groups (model rats treated with HXWTF 420, 840 or 1680&#x000a0;mg/kg, respectively). HXWTF and isosorbide mononitrate sustained release tablets (AstraZeneca) were dissolved in distilled water and given intragastric administration, respectively. The dosage of intragastric administration was the equivalent dose converted by the surface area of the human. The sham group and model group were given equivalent distilled water. Isosorbide mononitrate sustained release tablets and HXWTF were intragastrically administrated once daily after operation for consecutive 4&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preparation of HXWTF</title><p id="Par27">HXWTF contains the following ingredients: <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic> Bunge 30&#x000a0;g, <italic>Cinnamomum cassia </italic> (L.) 10&#x000a0;g, <italic>Ligusticum striatum </italic> DC. 9&#x000a0;g, <italic>Caulis spatholobi</italic> 10&#x000a0;g, <italic>Paeonia lactiflora </italic> Pall. 10&#x000a0;g, <italic>Codonopsis pilosula </italic> (Franch.) 10&#x000a0;g. HXWTF is a ten times concentrated granule made from six Chinese medicinal herbs mentioned above. The concentrated granules of single traditional Chinese medicine were prepared by five steps including water boiling extraction, low temperature concentration, spray drying, dry granulation and packaging.

Because most of the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine are mostly unclear, the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is used to qualitatively identify the dispensing granules of traditional Chinese medicine. The TLC identification results of formula granules achieved the standard of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (version 2010).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par48">The number of patients with MI is increasing gradually, which deteriorates the quality of life for patients worldwide and has become one of the cardiovascular diseases with the highest mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the current study, our results revealed that rats with MI exhibited abnormal cardiac function, increased infarct size, ischemic pathological changes, led to apoptosis of cardiac myocytes and vascular regeneration dysfunction. However, HXWTF treatment restored heart function, reduced the myocardium infarct size, inhibited myocardial apoptosis, and improved angiogenic function through blocking CaMKII phosphorylation at Thr286 and CaMKII oxidation under ischemic and hypoxic conditions. Therefore, these data indicated that HXWTF improves myocardial ischemia in part through inhibiting CaMKII phosphorylation and oxidation promoting angiogenesis and retarding apoptosis.</p><p id="Par49">Myocardial ischemia prevents the necessary blood flow to the heart tissues, leading to coronary angiogenesis obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Cardiac neovascularization is an important protective mechanism of ischemic heart disease. Recent studies have revealed that the hearts of neonatal mice use a new mechanism to establish collateral arteries to cope with injury. Arterial endothelial cells migrated from artery to collateral artery along existing capillaries to achieve neonatal cardiac regeneration, which may be used as a potential therapy for ischemic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies have confirmed that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) had the potential to differentiate into endothelial cells and injected EPCs into the hearts of MI can improve cardiac function via promoting neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, EPCs play an important role in protecting vascular endothelium and the formation of new blood vessels in cardiovascular disease. However, the specific mechanisms are still largely complicated. Here, our findings showed that HXWTF ameliorates myocardial damage through promoting angiogenesis in ischemic heart and tube formation in hypoxic endothelial cells by inhibiting CaMKII activation, which may provide theoretical basis and therapeutic mechanism for the treatment of MI.</p><p id="Par50">Apoptosis is a common phenomenon in physiological processes, but excessive cell apoptosis will directly lead to the decline of tissue and organ function. The increase and acceleration of cardiomyocyte apoptosis may be a key factor in MI. Previous studies have shown that ischemia/reperfusion injury can cause ROS accumulation and trigger caspase 3 activation leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis in ischemic heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Apoptosis is characterized by chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and protein cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There are two major pathways mediate activating endotheliocyte apoptosis. Interaction with death receptor ligand, such as Fas, result in the formation of death-induced Fas associated death domain (Fadd) and initiator caspase 8, which then directly activates caspase 3, ultimately initiates cell death (extrinsic apoptotic pathway). Furthermore, death signals cause mitochondrial activation and releasing of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins to form the apoptosome and activates caspase 9, eventually trigger cell death (intrinsic apoptotic pathway) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Better and deeper understanding the exact mechanisms of cardiomyocyte apoptosis may lead to important and effective therapeutic strategies that significantly diminish the incidence and mortality of ischemic heart disease, especially in MI. In this study, we have confirmed that myocardial ischemia was associated with higher number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes followed by activation of caspase 3/8 activity. Interestingly, HXWTF can markedly inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis by preventing the caspase 3/8 activity and enhancing Bcl-2/Bax ratio.</p><p id="Par51">Calmodulin (CaM) dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an important protein and has been noted for participating in the processes of several cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis, inflammation, heart failure, arrhythmias, pathological cardiac remodeling, MI, myocardial ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. CaMKII is a serine/threonine kinase, which exists as an enzyme complex. There are four CaMKII subtypes (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4;). These CaMKII subtypes are distributed in different tissues. Among them, CaMKII&#x003b4; is mainly enriched in the heart and activated by autophosphorylation or oxidation, which is implicated in heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Relevant evidences suggested that cardiac-specific CaMKII&#x003b4; gene deletion alleviates ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion induced infarct formation, inflammatory reaction, myocardial cell death and loss of cardiac systolic function by NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, studies have demonstrated that the absence of CaMKII after cardiac injury can attenuate cardiac remodeling and reverse the symptoms of heart failure, suggesting that CaMKII inhibition is a promising treatment for heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Moreover, CaMKII is essential for both endothelium-derived relaxation and eNOS activity in type 2 diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Meanwhile, activated CaMKII mediates apoptosis of retinal capillary endothelial cells induced by hyperglycemia via activation mitochondrial dependent and death receptor Fas/Fadd apoptosis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, the effects of CaMKII activity on angiogenesis and apoptosis in ischemic heart disease has not been fully studied. In this study, we have confirmed that up-regulation of CaMKII oxidation or phosphorylation plays a critical role in ischemic-induced revascularization dysfunction and apoptosis in the heart, and then HXWTF could effectively repair the impairment of angiogenesis and inhibit myocardial apoptosis in ischemic heart and H/SD-treated HCMECs or H9c2, at least in part, may be attributable to a reduced CaMKII oxidation or phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">The present study suggests that elevation of CaMKII oxidation and phosphorylation is involved in cardiac dysfunction of MI, and HXWTF ameliorates myocardial ischemia through promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis via down-regulation of CaMKII oxidation and phosphorylation levels. Therefore, the oxidation or phosphorylation of CaMKII may represent an important therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic heart disease, especially MI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec27"><p>
