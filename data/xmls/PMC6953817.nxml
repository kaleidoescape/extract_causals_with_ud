Substantially porous implants are increasingly used in a number of orthopaedic applications. HA plasma spraying&#x02013;a line of sight process&#x02014;cannot coat the inner surfaces of substantially porous structures, whereas electrochemical deposition of calcium phosphate can fully coat the inner surfaces of porous implants for improved bioactivity, but the osseous response of different types of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings with ionic substitutions has not been evaluated for implants in the same <italic>in vivo</italic> model. In this study, laser sintered Ti6Al4V implants with pore sizes of &#x000d8; 700 &#x003bc;m and &#x000d8; 1500 &#x003bc;m were electrochemically coated with HA, silicon-substituted HA (SiHA), and strontium-substituted HA (SrHA), and implanted in ovine femoral condylar defects. Implants were retrieved after 6 weeks and histological and histomorphometric evaluation were compared to electrochemically coated implants with uncoated and HA plasma sprayed controls. The HA, SiHA and SrHA coatings had Ca:P, Ca:(P+Si) and (Ca+Sr):P ratios of 1.53, 1.14 and 1.32 respectively. Electrochemically coated implants significantly promoted bone attachment to the implant surfaces of the inner pores and displayed improved osseointegration compared to uncoated scaffolds for both pore sizes (p&#x0003c;0.001), whereas bone ingrowth was restricted to the surface for HA plasma coated or uncoated implants. Electrochemically coated HA implants achieved the highest osseointegration, followed by SrHA coated implants, and both coatings exhibited significantly more bone growth than plasma sprayed groups (p&#x02264;0.01 for all 4 cases). SiHA had significantly more osseointegration when compared against the uncoated control, but no significant difference compared with other coatings. There was no significant difference in ingrowth or osseointegration between pore sizes, and the bone-implant-contact was significantly higher in the electrochemical HA than in SiHA or SrHA. These results suggest that osseointegration is insensitive to pore size, whereas surface modification through the presence of an osteoconductive coating plays an important role in improving osseointegration, which may be critically important for extensively porous implants.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000776</institution-id><institution>Orthopaedic Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blunn</surname><given-names>Gordon W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000297</institution-id><institution>Royal College of Surgeons of England</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mumith</surname><given-names>Aadil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Skeletal Action Cancer Trust</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blunn</surname><given-names>Gordon W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Orthopaedic Research UK (grant #515), the Royal College of Surgeons and the Skeletal Action Cancer Trust.

This allows the manufacture of implants with lower structural stiffness to reduce stress shielding [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and porous structures that mimic bone morphology [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] to optimise bone ingrowth and osseointegration into the implant [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] for stable, long-term fixation [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Osseointegration improves the implant-stability [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and load transfer, redistributing forces to the bone more physiologically [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and reduces the risk of fibrous tissue formation [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and implant failure [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Advances in the fabrication of porous structures using additive manufacturing [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have led to the increased use of SLS implants in cranioplasty, spinal fusion, segmental bone defect, and dental implants, among other orthopaedic applications. The parameters governing bone ingrowth obtained from investigating thin porous coatings onto solid implant surfaces, used for example in hip replacement, may be different from those governing bone ingrowth into substantially porous structures [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The design, implant location, stress shielding, bone ingrowth and implant failure may be related, as finite element analysis studies have shown that bone ingrowth into the porous structures can be limited due to stress shielding and that this can increase stress in the implant, possibly reducing the fatigue life of the implant [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For these reasons, it is important to optimise bone ingrowth into porous implants, particularly as load bearing structures.</p><p>Several studies have investigated the effect of pore size on bone ingrowth into porous implants. Taniguchi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] examined the use of a diamond lattice design with porosity of 65% in trabecular bone of the rabbit femurs, and three pore sizes of 300, 600 and 900 &#x003bc;m. The 900 &#x003bc;m pore size had the highest ingrowth at 4 weeks, significantly larger than for 300 &#x003bc;m pores. However, at 8 weeks, the 600 &#x003bc;m pore size had the highest ingrowth, but not significantly higher than the other pore sizes. Van der Stok et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] studied the insertion of porous scaffolds with fixed pore size of 490 &#x003bc;m and two different porosities of 68% and 88% in cortical defects of rats and found no significant difference in bone ingrowth. A study on the influence of different microarchitecture with pore sizes between 700 to 1300 &#x003bc;m and open channels between 290 to 700 &#x003bc;m also showed excellent osteoconduction and ingrowth in all cases [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A pore size of 1500 &#x003bc;m has also been found to be successful in promoting bone ingrowth in endo-prostheses used for limb reconstruction after bone tumour resection [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Taken together, these results suggest that pore sizes of 300&#x02013;1500 &#x003bc;m are suitable in the design of implants to induce bone ingrowth <italic>in vivo</italic>, while ensuring the development of a vasculature system that is essential for bone formation [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Bone ingrowth in porous implants is not sufficient to ensure direct bone-implant fixation as several studies using Tantalum (Ta), Titanium (Ti) and Ti-based alloys have reported the presence of fibrous tissue encapsulating the porous implant [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One method to improve the bioactivity of bone bonding is through surface modification of these implants, such as through chemical and heat treatment [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, this method is not effective for forming apatite on Ti6Al4V implants, which bonds to both bone and implant surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], increasing the rate of bone ingrowth and bone-implant contact [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Another method is by coating the implants with HA or other calcium phosphate (Ca-P) based coatings through porous surface coatings such as plasma spraying [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but the line-of-sight technique produces uneven layers of coating and does not coat the complex inner porous structure [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Electrochemical deposition of HA provides an alternative method to coat complex geometries [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Modified coatings and bone graft materials that incorporated various ionic substitutions within stoichiometric HA have been shown to be effective in increasing the bioactivity, thereby encouraging more bone growth or surface osseointegration than HA alone [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Different anionic and cationic substitutions have been studied, including zinc, fluorine, chlorine, strontium, potassium and silicon, found in natural bone as substituted HA [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Various studies involving silicon substituted HA (SiHA) demonstrated an improvement in osteoblastic cell proliferation and morphology [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], adhesion of osteoblasts to the coating [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and improved bone ingrowth and osseointegration [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Studies that investigated the effect of silicon concentration for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments suggested there may be an optimal level of Si for bone formation. Porous bone graft substitutes implanted in the femoral intercondylar notch of rabbits showed that the rate and quality of bone formation and adaptive remodelling were sensitive to the level of Si content in HA [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A 0.8 wt% of Si was optimal in achieving the highest amount of bone ingrowth, and higher Si content (1.5 wt%) decreased the mineral apposition rate. This could be related to the cellular response to SiHA as 0.8 wt% Si was demonstrated to upregulate genes for osteoblast development, whereas a 1.6 wt% Si led to reduced proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Strontium (Sr) is also used for substitution within the HA lattice due to its similarity in chemical and physical behaviour to Ca. Moreover, several pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that strontium ranelate increases bone formation while inhibiting bone resorption [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Strontium substituted HA (SrHA) coatings have been shown to stimulate osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, while having a negative influence on osteoclasts [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An optimal Sr content of 3&#x02013;7 atomic percentage has been suggested [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The effect of SrHA with 10 mol % Sr was also shown to improve implant osseointegration and pull-out strength by more than 50% when compared to stoichiometric HA in an osteoporotic rat model [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The increase in bone-implant contact was also confirmed in SrHA synthesized using electrochemical methods and implanted in a rabbit model [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have compared SrHA and SiHA in polycaprolactone scaffolds [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and pure titanium blocks [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, no animal experiments comparing the effects of SrHA and SiHA coatings in Ti6Al4V using electrochemical deposition has been reported, and bone formation within extensively porous coated implants may be different from implants with porous coated surfaces. This study was designed to investigate bone ingrowth into SLS porous structures, electrochemically coated with SiHA and SrHA in an ovine femoral condylar critical sized defect model.

Eight skeletally mature sheep were used in this study. Following general anesthesia, 8x15mm defects were drilled in the medial femoral condyles of adult sheep bilaterally.

All animals recovered well and were allowed to weight bear immediately post-operatively. A total of 30 implants, with 6 implants in each group was used in this study. Power analysis based on previous studies indicates that six samples should be used for each group to prove significance with 20% between the mean, a power of 0.8, and a standard deviation of 5%. Four implant positions were possible per sheep (right proximal, right distal, left proximal, left distal) and the position of implants from each group were changed so that they all occupied different positions in the condyles.

None of the electrochemically coated implants had significantly higher bone area ratio than the plasma sprayed positive control, and the bone area ratio for SrHA and SiHA were not significantly higher than for the electrochemical HA implant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, implants with pore sizes of 700 &#x003bc;m and 1500 &#x003bc;m were electrochemically coated with HA, SiHA and SrHA, and inserted into an ovine condylar defect model for 6 weeks. The effect on bone ingrowth and osseointegration against uncoated and plasma-sprayed implants was compared. Although the performance of SiHA and SrHA had been investigated in polycaprolactone scaffolds and pure titanium blocks [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], this is the first study that directly compared the <italic>in vivo</italic> osseoconductivity and ingrowth of three electrochemical coatings in laser-sintered Ti6Al4V implants of two pore sizes, against two controls. Results showed that bone formation occurred along the metallic structure and not in the interior pores. There was high osseointegration of over 50% BIC for the electrochemically coated implants, significantly higher than the plasma sprayed implants (positive control) for HA and SrHA, but there was no significant increase in the bone area ratio in any of the electrochemically coated implants compared to the plasma sprayed implants.</p><p>Electrochemical deposition offers the advantage of fully coating the interior surfaces of porous implants, over line-of-sight processes such as plasma spraying, which can only coat the outer regions. It has also been shown in literature that substituting calcium with strontium and silicon can enhance bone formation compared to plain HA coating. This led to the hypothesis that electrochemically coated SiHA and SrHA implants would have significantly higher osseointegration and bone ingrowth than plasma sprayed or electrochemically coated HA implants. Substituted hydroxyapatites are thought to provide a more physiological mineral, as HA found in native bone contains many ionic substitutions. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of SiHA and SrHA coatings to increase the reactivity of osteoblast and bone apposition rate over unsubstituted HA [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The surface morphologies were different for all the coatings in this study; electrochemically coated HA and SrHA both displayed plate-like crystalline structures, which were smaller in scale in SrHA than HA. SiHA had needle-like crystalline structures and plasma-sprayed coating was present as HA globules. XRD analysis revealed that plasma sprayed coating was the most crystalline, while the electrochemical coatings had similar XRD spectra, with amorphous phase present. Highly crystalline structures have improved coating longevity, due to reduced solubility compared to amorphous ones [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, bone mineral has lower crystallinity compared to many commercial plasma sprayed HA coatings. The coatings in this study were present at 6 weeks in the animal model, and the high BIC of above 50% for the electrochemically coated implants of both pore sizes, and above 35% for plasma-sprayed implants with the larger pores suggest that implant fixation had occurred. Within the porous structure, bone occurred only on electrochemically coated surfaces. The lumen of the pores were not filled, suggesting that the bone response was associated with the osteoconductivty of the surface. Using the same animal model, Reznikov et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] noted that bone regeneration within the interior of the scaffold was inversely proportional to scaffold stiffness and was strain driven. This is in line with the theoretical work carried out by Cheong et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] who used adaptive finite element algorithms to predict bone ingrowth in additive manufactured porous implants and showed that stress shielding of porous implants made from conventional titanium alloy limited ingrowth and osseointegration, reducing the stimulus for bone remodeling in the inner pores below the minimum level for bone formation for both pore sizes. This would explain the observation in this study that coating had less effect on overall bone formation than surface integration (BIC). The finite element analysis also showed that the presence of coating has a similar effect to lowering the stimulus for bone formation, leading to improved bone ingrowth. These results suggest that surface modification of porous scaffolds that fully coats all the porous regions of the implant is influential in encouraging osseointegration, but overall bone ingrowth depends to a larger degree on the structural stiffness and stress shielding within the implant.</p><p>The results in our current study showed improved osseointegration of electrochemical HA, SiHA and SrHA, over the negative, uncoated control. Electrochemical HA and SrHA also had significantly higher BIC over the positive control of plasma-sprayed HA. This could be due to the increased solubility of the amorphous phase in the electrochemical coatings, as the dissolution of HA accelerates the formation of biological apatite to bond with bone tissues [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The lower BIC in the smaller pore, plasma-sprayed implant is likely due to the coating not reaching the inner regions of the porous implant as it is a line-of-sight technique.</p><p>The results showed no statistically significant difference between the osseointegration (BIC) among the three electrochemical coatings. Surface morphology is known to affect cell attachment and differentiation of osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and possible reasons for this finding could be due to the similarity in surface roughness of these three coatings (4&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;m (Ra), not statistically different) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227232.s003">S2 Table</xref>). However, the control implants were also etched and had the same degree of surface roughness, and there was no difference in the proliferation or the differentiation of these cells on electrochemically coated surfaces with the uncoated control <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227232.s004">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227232.s005">S4</xref> Tables). Hence, this effect is more likely associated with the chemical nature of the coatings in a 3D structure.</p><p>The second reason could be due to the composition of the substituted element. The SiHA coating in this study had a 1.63wt% of Si, which is similar to the results presented by Hing et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which showed in a rabbit model that bone graft substituted with 1.5wt% Si had no significant difference in bone ratio compared to 0wt% Si in bone ratio at 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks. A 7.7wt% of Si has been reported to significantly increase MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell growth in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but the optimum level found for bone formation in an <italic>in vivo</italic> study is 0.8wt% [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Higher levels of Si have been linked with increased cytotoxicity [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which accumulates faster in 3D porous structures as waste removal is slower than on 2D surfaces. Moreover, if Si substitution increases above 2 wt%, HA starts to destabilise and alpha triclacium phosphate is formed [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The SrHA in this study utilized a Sr/(Sr+Ca) ratio of 10%, but the results obtained are different from literature utilizing the same molar ratio of Sr for the sol-gel-dip coating method, where significantly higher bone formation was demonstrated compared with non-substituted controls in rabbit and mouse models [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The reference methodology for SrHA coating reported a measured Sr content of 4.7 wt%, which is marginally higher than the 4.08 wt% used in this study [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The authors also reported significantly improved osteoblast proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and osseointegration around the threads of implant screws, compared to 5% SrHA and uncoated implants [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In our study, SrHA did not perform better than the other electrochemically deposited coatings and this could be due to stress shielding within the pores. Sr concentrations of 6.25 atomic percentage (at%) has been reported to significantly increase both bone area ratio and BIC in porous implants, but the measured value in this study was only 1%. The Ca:P ratio of 1.31 obtained in this study is also higher than the value of 1.1 that Liang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] obtained, suggesting that the SrHA coating obtained has a closer chemical resemblance to stoichiometric HA.</p><p>The implants were designed with pore sizes of 700 &#x003bc;m and 1500 &#x003bc;m, within the range of pore sizes that have reported good bone ingrowth <italic>in vivo</italic>. The implants had porosities of 75% and 70% respectively, leading to a larger internal surface area for bone attachment in the smaller pore size. No significant difference for BIC between the two pore sizes was found in line with literature [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, the femoral condyle defect model utilised in this study may not be fully representative of the mechanical forces encountered in functional implants used in humans. The lower forces in the trabecular bone surrounding the implant may be the reason for the relatively low amount of bone ingrowth compared with porous implants in canine diaphysis with above 50% of bone ingrowth reported [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The extent of bone ingrowth was only assessed at one time point, at 6 weeks, which may not be at equilibrium [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although this duration is commonly used in small ruminants to assess the initial success of implants [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], further testing at multiple time points would be required to assess the long-term performance of the implant. Long term testing may also be important as previous studies in goats have shown the resorption of apatite coating not in direct contact with the implant and newly formed bone, after 6 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. FEA studies using new algorithms for osteoconduction, verified with histology results, showed that the presence of coating lowers the mechanical stimulus for bone formation [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Hence, the dissolution of the coating may affect the mechanical stimulus required to maintain the bone. The histological analysis was conducted with the aim of evaluating bone ingrowth and osseointegration and used only one type of staining due to the limited sample size. Future studies could also include other staining methods such as Haemotoxylin and Eosin to better understand the process of osteogenesis, or fluorochrome labelling to investigate bone apposition and the rate of osteoconduction. Nevertheless, this study highlights the importance of coating the inner pores of substantially porous structures. This study used different conditions to produce the coatings in order to maximise bone ingrowth. The results showed that further work to develop the electrochemical deposition process is required to lower the Si content and increase the Sr content to optimum levels reported for sol-gel-dip coating. Wettability studies have not been conducted in this study as HA is osteoconductive, and the low amount of substitution was not expected to change the surface energy of the coatings significantly. However, this could be considered as part of future work to determine the effect of substitution on the surface energy of the coatings. This study only investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> response of implants with two pore sizes with similar porosities. The results in this paper showed that there is a significant difference in BIC and bone ratio between implants that are HA-coated or uncoated, but porous implants with porosities of 63% and 49% manufactured by EBM and SLM have both shown no significant difference whether the implants are uncoated or HA-coated in a goat model [<xref rid="pone.0227232.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The link between stress shielding and osteoconductivity and bone ingrowth should thus be considered in the development and design of implants for human use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study compared the extent of bone ingrowth and osseointegration of completely porous implants with electrochemically deposited HA coating with three different ionic substitutions, in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model for the first time. The results indicated that unsubstituted HA and SrHA led to significantly increased osseointegration compared to uncoated and HA plasma sprayed control groups, whereas there was no significant difference between the pore sizes tested. This suggests that for porous implants, osseointegration is less driven by pore size than by the presence of a bioactive coating and the overall stiffness of the implant. For implants electrochemically coated with HA, over 80% of the inner porous surface was osseointegrated, whereas osseointegration was about 10% with non-coated implants in the outer pores. The combination of porous structures with electrochemically deposited coating has the potential to be developed further as a bone ingrowth region in segmental prostheses, to protect the implant from failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227232.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Experimental details on the electrochemical deposition of HA, SiHA and SrHA.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227232.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227232.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Optimisation of the parameters for electrochemical deposition of SiHA and SrHA using 10 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness discs.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227232.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227232.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of surface roughness (Ra; nm) measured from 10 mm diameter and 3mm thickness discs.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227232.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227232.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Quantification of ovine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using AlamarBlue assay.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227232.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227232.s005"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Quantification of osteogenic differentiation of ovine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for all coatings on 10 mm diameter and 3mm thickness discs.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227232.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227232.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Biemond</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hannink</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Verdonschot</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Buma</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name> (<year>2013</year>) <article-title>Bone ingrowth potential of electron beam and selective laser melting produced trabecular-like implant surfaces with and without a biomimetic coating</article-title>. <source>J Mater Sci Mater Med</source>
