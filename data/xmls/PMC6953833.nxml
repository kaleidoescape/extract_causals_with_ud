id="sec005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Measuring regulation of the mitochondrial energy ecosystem is thought to be useful for indicating vulnerability to metabolic challenges as well as an index of treatment efficacy. Mitochondria function is often studied by measuring responses in either isolated mitochondria, cells, or excised tissue following metabolic stimulation via a mitochondrial uncoupler, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Exogenous uncouplers, or endogenous uncoupling proteins, shuttle protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane thus disrupting the mitochondrial proton gradient used to generate ATP. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> studies suggest that mitochondrial protonophores stimulate metabolism but only if sufficient reserve capacity is available [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, if mitochondrial reserve capacity is relatively limited, then DNP is not expected to increase respiration by much with correspondingly little change in the production of oxygen free radicals, and CO<sub>2</sub> and waste water [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, neurons with a relatively larger mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity exposed to DNP will show relatively larger reductions in their local levels of oxygen with greater flux through the electron transport chain. In turn, this results in a larger reduction in the leakage of damaging oxygen free radicals from the mitochondria; CO<sub>2</sub> and water production are also expected to increase with higher metabolic rate leading to greater water removal in, for example, the outer retina [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Importantly, as recently reviewed, preclinical studies indicate that low doses of DNP can be useful as safe neuroprotective agents in a range of diseases [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, there is a need for new imaging biomarkers with translational potential for evaluating the impact of mitochondrial protonophores <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Rod photoreceptor mitochondria utilize their spare respiratory reserve to respond to energy challenges, oxidative stress, and degeneration [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, in this study, we examined two novel imaging biomarkers for non-invasively mapping outer retina responses following metabolic stimulation via mild mitochondrial uncoupling with DNP.

For example, we have reported that physiologic mitochondrial respiratory changes with dark-and light-adaptation have a measurable impact on ELM-RPE thickness and water mobility as measured by OCT and diffusion MRI <italic>in vivo</italic>; notably, OCT showed a higher detection sensitivity likely due to its order-of-magnitude greater spatial resolution [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

A significance level of 0.05 was used for most tests, with interactions being tested using a significance level of 0.10 due to these tests having less power. We used linear mixed models with the Kenward-Roger method for calculating degrees of freedom in SAS 9.4 (SAS software, Cary, NC, USA) to analyze both R1 and MRI thickness since both had repeated measures for each mouse. R1 is measured along retina depth, resulting in an MRI profile. We used restricted cubic splines to model and compare mouse-specific profiles between groups. The number of &#x0201c;windows&#x0201d; with a relationship between R1 and location (i.e., &#x0201c;knots&#x0201d;) was initially evaluated separately for each group for any given analysis, and the Akaike and Schwarz Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) were used to identify the model with the fewest knots needed to model all groups. Random coefficients for the intercept, side, the location-specific coefficients (cubic spline coefficients), and two-way interactions among these effects with mouse nested within strain and dose were also evaluated using AIC and BIC. Given the random spline coefficients included in all models, we used an unstructured covariance matrix for the random coefficients to account for associations in spline coefficients due to subject-specific profiles. The final model included the random coefficients for the intercept, side, depth, second, fourth and fifth knot, and knot*right coefficients. The model included the fixed effects of strain, DNP dose (0, 5, or 10 mg/kg), side of the ONL, location-specific values for the cubic splines, and four-way interactions among the main effects. The four-way interaction of strain, DNP dose, side, and depth was significant (p = 0.0678), indicating that MRI profiles depended on the specific combination of strain, dose and side. Mean profiles and comparisons of the mean profiles were generated using linear contrasts. Both linear and quadratic comparisons were evaluated among DNP doses since these two comparisons are independent and allow us to fully explain any differences among DNP doses.</p><p>For MRI thickness, the linear mixed model included the fixed effects of strain, DNP dose, side, and all interactions.

Neither of these random effects were included since AIC/BIC was not reduced by adding these random coefficients to the model. The three-way interaction of strain, DNP treatment, and side and the two-way interaction of DNP treatment and side were not significant at the 0.10 level, leading to a final model that included all main effects and the two-way interactions of strain*DNP treat and strain*side.

Respiratory adaptation and culling of mitochondria generally takes chronic exposure to uncouplers [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The present OCT studies are sensitive to ELM-RPE hydration status which is modified by mitochondrial oxygen consumption [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our working model is that when rods produce CO<sub>2</sub> and water, a pH-sensitive water removal co-transporter is upregulated on the RPE causing the ELM-RPE region to thin [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The strain-dependent response of ELM-RPE thinning patterns to DNP reported herein in dark, and supported by DNP-assisted R1 MRI measurements, appear consistent with our report of rod cells of S6 mice having a relatively greater mitochondrial reserve capacity than that of B6 mice based on <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>We considered the possibility that endogenous or high concentrations of uncouplers that reduce the protonmotive force might alter ATP synthase activity. However, as reviewed elsewhere, even relatively high, repeated doses of DNP do not alter ATP content or the ATP pool as measured <italic>in vivo</italic> using <sup>31</sup>P magnetic resonance spectroscopy [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the current study, we used relatively low doses, performed experiments in both dark-and light-adapted mice (which gave different results suggesting no evidence for DNP-induced damaging energetic limitation), and our measurements were done at acute time points. This latter point is germane since respiratory adaptation and culling of mitochondria is thought to take chronic exposure to uncouplers [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nonetheless, future studies will assess this important question by direct measurement of ATP:ADP with and without DNP in the retina.</p><p>DNP might have potential off-target effects such as decreased cardiac output that could limit interpretation of actions selective to the retina. If systemic toxicity or off-target effects were a problem, one would expect to see global changes throughout the retina in our biomarkers in the two mouse strains. For example, if DNP stimulated a reduction in cardiac output it is anticipated that blood flow in the inner retina and choroid (the blood supply to the outer retina) would be lower which would affect inner retina thickness and R1; no such effect was seen in the S6 or B6 mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g005">5</xref>). Instead, the effects of DNP were highly localized to the outer retina, were light-adaptation dependent, and were strain-specific consistent with an <italic>ex vivo</italic> report. An example of this is the localized impact of DNP to within the avascular outer retina with a dose-dependent R1 response noted in the inferior retina of dark-adapted S6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In addition, a previous study examined similar doses of DNP as used herein and found increased brain oxygen consumption rates with stable vital signs in pigs [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Together, the above considerations argue against systemic or off-target contributions and support the notion that low doses of DNP can induce localized reductions in R1 in outer retina mitochondria, consistent with reduced free radicals and / or oxygen levels. However, The R1 of different ROS is not known at present and also we don&#x02019;t know the mixture of ROS that are impacting R1. Thus, it is unclear whether ROS or oxygen contribute more to the R1 signal.</p><p>A related potential drawback of DNP is that it has a limited safety index [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We note that the doses of 5&#x02013;10 mg/kg DNP used herein are below the DNP LD50 of 35 to 72 mg/kg in mice [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Systemic DNP given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg or greater raised plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in rats suggesting the presence of liver damage [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Nonetheless, as was recently reviewed, low doses of DNP as used in this study did not appear to be toxic (see above) [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We note that the 10 mg/kg dose killed two out of the seven urethane-anesthetized B6 mice studied, none of the mice used for OCT (anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine), and the 20 mg/kg dose killed two urethane-anesthetized B6 mice in a preliminary experiment (data not shown). For this reason, doses higher than 10 mg/kg were not investigated in this study. It seems, based on the LD50 and other recently reviewed considerations that these fatalities do not reflect on DNP toxicity <italic>per se</italic> but rather a possible interaction between DNP and urethane [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; the 20 mg/kg dose was not investigated in urethane-anesthetized S6 mice. Urethane is well studied and maintains systemic and neuronal physiology to levels found in conscious animals although its mode of action remains somewhat unclear [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Nonetheless, similar doses of DNP as used in this study were also used previously without systemic toxicity in ketamine-anesthetized pigs [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Future studies will investigate the usefulness of using other anesthetics that do not interact with DNP for the MRI experiments, as well as controlled-release oral formulations of DNP [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Alternatively, MP201 (a prodrug to DNP) also has a high safety index and no reported negative consequences in B6 mice at 80 mg/kg [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Physiologically, DNP is expected to stimulate an increase in oxygen consumption rate in mitochondria, particularly in the mitochondria-dense inner segment region but also in other regions such as the retinal pigment epithelium. The stimulation of respiration by DNP is also predicted to cause an increase in higher CO<sub>2</sub> and waste water production accompanied by increased removal of this acidified water in the ELM-RPE region. Water removal in dark-adapted mice is assisted by increased production of CO<sub>2</sub> and waste water leading to a more acidified environment that upregulates a co-transporter on the apical portion of the RPE, as demonstrated by comparing dark- and light-adapted retina and suggested previously by DNP-evoked reduction of edema in a nerve injury model [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our observations that the ELM-RPE region gets smaller than normal with DNP in dark- and light-adapted B6 and S6 mice are in-line with a greater removal of acidified water linked with increased metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, an DNP-evoked increase in oxygen consumption will reduce levels of paramagnetic oxygen and free radical production that together provide a reasonable explanation for the observed reduction in R1 in S6 mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g002">2</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>The present study also found a relatively greater ELM-RPE thinning in response to DNP in light-adapted B6 mice compared with S6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These results support distinct strain-dependent mitochondrial energy ecosystems in the outer retina [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This might arise from, for example, having different set-points and / or regulation of the RPE water removal co-transporter in B6 than in S6 mice. More work is needed to unravel the different strain-dependent contributions from mitochondrial water production and RPE removal that underlie this difference It is worth noting that S6 and B6 mice have a variety of genetic differences, including a RPE65 variant in S6 that increases rhodopsin regeneration rate compared to that in B6 mice [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and a natural knock-out mutation in the nicotinamide (NAD) nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) gene in B6 mice that can alter mitochondrial NAD(P) redox homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Additional studies are needed to explore potential links these genetic mutations and the observed differences in OCT and MRI biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that DNP stimulation of metabolism will also generate heat that could decrease R1; the impact of heat on the ELM-RPE thickness is unclear [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, body temperature raises with DNP are reported at doses greater than 25 mg/kg [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Also, a 5 mg/kg dose given daily does not cause weight loss in mice [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We speculate that any production of heat by DNP does not exceed the heat-removal ability of the two circulatory beds of the retina [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In addition, DNP-evoked increase in energy expenditure (i.e., heat generation) might be expected to increase retinal blood flow as has been observed in other organs, perhaps as a cooling mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, an increase in blood flow would increase the inflow of fresh spins into the voxels and cause MRI R1 to increase in the vascular portions of the retina, and this was not seen in the inner retina of S6 and B6 mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226840.g005">5</xref>); note that the photoreceptor layer is avascular.</p><p>Intriguingly, OCT and MRI showed different spatial responses to DNP. For example, in S6 mice, DNP affected the ELM-RPE region in both inferior and superior retina, whereas only R1 in the inferior retina was affected. We speculate that this difference reflects a relatively lower statistical power in the MRI data due to a combination of, for example, the cross-sectional experimental design used instead of the paired design in the OCT study, and the lower spatial resolution of MRI (21 &#x003bc;m) compared to that of OCT (1.6 &#x003bc;m). Unfortunately, a paired design is not feasible for the MRI experiment because of the use of the terminal anesthetic urethane. Alternative anesthetics, such as isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine, have limited use for the retinal MRI studies. The MRI eye coil occupies the same physical space as the isoflurane nose cone so both cannot be used together. Ketamine / xyalzine provides anesthesia for only ~30 min which is too short for a typical MRI examination which lasts ~ 1 hr. Presenting the retina with a higher concentration of DNP might improve the detection sensitivity of the MRI experiment. More work is needed to determine if, for example, direct intraocular injection of DNP, or alternative formulations of DNP (see below) would be useful in this regard [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Nonetheless, our primary observation that DNP elicits changes in both MRI and OCT biomarkers in the outer retina in S6 mice relative to B6 mice supports our working hypothesis [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the present results support continued investigation of ELM-RPE OCT thickness and R1 MRI measurements as useful approaches for monitoring the impact of mitochondrial protonophores for evaluating <italic>in vivo</italic> the rod photoreceptor mitochondrial energy ecosystem [<xref rid="pone.0226840.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226840.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

The article is clearly written and the data is well presented and carefully analyzed. However, the experimental design and interpretation of the data need to be reassessed in view of the following considerations:</p><p>1) Only dark adapted retinas were analyzed. The justification for this is based on the accepted view (refs. 23-25) that oxidative phosphorylation in the retina is more active in the dark than under light because of a faster ATP turnover. However, this implies that mitochondrial reserve capacity is reduced in the dark, that is, basal respiration will be closer to its maximal possible rate in the dark than under light adapted conditions. This limits the effect of uncoupling by administration of agents such as DNP, given that respiration rate is almost completely maxed out even in the absence of endogenous uncoupler. Inclusion in the study of light adapted retinas should render the effects of uncoupling much more evident, while still showing strain-specific quantitative differences.</p><p>2) Ex-vivo basal and maximal respiration (used to calculate mitochondrial reserve capacity) comparing S6 and B6 retinas has only been assessed under light adapted conditions (ref. 4), but not after dark adaptation. Water content and retinal thickness was found to be different between the two strains only under light (but not dark) adaptation (ref. 4). This also highlights the need to perform the reported experiments under light adapted conditions.</p><p>3) Mild uncoupling should not be considered to simply decrease oxygen concentration and acidity by virtue of an increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and CO2 generation; its more important (and undesirable) effect is likely the decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis by dissipating the protonmotive force across the mitochondrial membrane, especially in photoreceptors (and more critically in the dark because of a higher ATP demand), where little mitochondrial reserve capacity exists. Is the content of high energy phosphates (i.e. creatine phosphate and ATP) changing upon addition of DNP? These have been monitored in other tissues by NMR (see Balaban, RS et al. (1986) Science 232:1121-3), or could also be quantified by mass spectrometry (metabolomics approach) or even by biochemical methods (although less reliably). If ATP/creatine phosphate content does change, is the energy compromise the real cause of the change in water mobility? Uncoupled mitochondria are usually targeted for degradation by quality control mechanisms such as mitophagy (see Georgakopoulos ND et al. (2017) Nat Chem Biol 13:136-146, for example). Is this happening in dark adapted photoreceptors at the DNP concentrations used? What would be the consequences of such changes on the imaging biomarkers presented in this paper? Even if the DNP concentrations used in this paper have been validated as non-toxic for the brain (ref. 10), it could well be that cells with much lower reserve capacity than brain neurons, such as photoreceptors, are being subjected to a damaging energetic limitation. Therefore, experiments showing that the so-called "mild" uncoupling employed in the present study is not compromising the energetic status of the retina should be included.</p><p>4) As stated by the authors, the MRI R1 is sensitive to both oxygen and ROS concentrations. These do not necessarily go in the same direction (see for instance Quarrie R et al. (2014) Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 307:H996-H1004). Which molecules contribute more to the R1 signal? Can they be distinguished by other methods? Related to this, NADPH is important for detoxifying ROS in mitochondria (see Francisco A et al. (2018) J Neurochem. 2018 147:663-677). Is the B6 strain used in the present study the same as the C57BL/6J strain that has a truncated version of the Nnt gene that codes for mitochondrial nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase? If so, could this be the reason in the different patterns reported between the S6 and B6 strain?</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is an important study from a group that has developed unique MRI-based methods and used them together with OCT to quantify and characterize distributions of O2, free radicals and water in mouse eyes. This study focuses on the effects of dinitrophenol on these distributions. Previous studies from this lab showed metabolic differences between two mouse strains so this report also includes a comparison of the effects of DNP on retinas from those two mouse strains. The study showed that DNP causes thinning and lowering of O2 levels in specific parts of the retinas and that this effect occurs to a greater extent in the S6 strain than in the B6 strain. The molecular interpretation of the findings is not yet definitive, but the authors do show how the methodology is fairly robust and that it can be used to report effects of metabolic perturbations.</p><p>Specific comments/suggestions:</p><p>1. line 84 - "...oxygen consumption rates are greater in S6 mice than in B6 mice..." Is this correct? - my reading of Fig. 1 in ref 4 was that O2 consumption is faster in B6 than in S6. Please correct or clarify.</p><p>2. This study reports effects only on dark-adapted animals whereas other reports from this group also included effects of light adaptation. Mitochondria from dark-adapted animals may be more active because of the increased demand for ATP synthesis in darkness than in light. Based on that, I would predict that effects of DNP might be more pronounced in light than they would be in darkness. Based on previous reports there could a greater fold increase in O2 consumption induced by DNP in light compared to darkness, there also could be a greater fold increase in water production induced by DNP in light compared to dark. Also, the authors reported previously that there is a hyporeflective band in OCT in light that is not present in darkness, so it I think it would be very relevant in this report to determine if there are effects of DNP on that feature. Such an experiment may help to define whether the hyporeflective band arises from a functional effect such as phototransduction of if instead it is caused by a metabolic effect (mitochondria may become more active with DNP, which would simulate their increased activity in darkness.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

The new ELM-RPE thickness data in the revision in light-adapted mice supported this hypothesis and the Results section, and Discussion paragraphs 1 and 6, are modified accordingly. </p><p>2) Ex-vivo basal and maximal respiration (used to calculate mitochondrial reserve capacity) comparing S6 and B6 retinas has only been assessed under light adapted conditions (ref. 4), but not after dark adaptation. Water content and retinal thickness was found to be different between the two strains only under light (but not dark) adaptation (ref. 4) also highlights the need to perform the reported experiments under light adapted conditions.</p><p>Response: Please see response to 1) above. </p><p>3) Mild uncoupling should not be considered to simply decrease oxygen concentration and acidity by virtue of an increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and CO2 generation; its more important (and undesirable) effect is likely the decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis by dissipating the protonmotive force across the mitochondrial membrane, especially in photoreceptors (and more critically in the dark because of a higher ATP demand), where little mitochondrial reserve capacity exists.

If ATP/creatine phosphate content does change, is the energy compromise the real cause of the change in water mobility? </p><p>Response: This comment is interesting and may have implications in states of endogenous or high concentrations of uncouplers that reduce the protonmotive force enough to alter ATP synthase activity. However, as reviewed and summarized by Geisler (PMID: 30909602), studies assessing this question have demonstrated that even relatively high, repeated doses of DNP do not alter ATP content or the ATP pool as measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the current study we used relatively low doses and our measurements were done in acute time points. Regardless, future studies will be able to assess this important question by direct measurement of ATP:ADP with and without DNP in the retina. A new second paragraph in the Discussion was added.</p><p>4) Uncoupled mitochondria are usually targeted for degradation by quality control mechanisms such as mitophagy (see Georgakopoulos ND et al. (2017) Nat Chem Biol 13:136-146, for example). Is this happening in dark adapted photoreceptors at the DNP concentrations used? What would be the consequences of such changes on the imaging biomarkers presented in this paper?</p><p>Response: This topic is very important but is not germane to the current study given the short duration of the experiments. Respiratory adaptation and culling of mitochondria generally takes chronic exposure to uncouplers (PMID: 21187326). The first paragraph of the Discussion has been modified accordingly.</p><p>5) Even if the DNP concentrations used in this paper have been validated as non-toxic for the brain (ref. 10), it could well be that cells with much lower reserve capacity than brain neurons, such as photoreceptors, are being subjected to a damaging energetic limitation. Therefore, experiments showing that the so-called "mild" uncoupling employed in the present study is not compromising the energetic status of the retina should be included.</p><p>Response: We have modified the 1st, 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of the discussion to indicate that the results in the light demonstrate that B6 mice are able to react to DNP (i.e., no evidence for damaging energetic limitations), and thus further support the above interpretation that DNP given to dark-adapted mice reflects changes to oxygen consumption that can be attributed to mitochondrial reserve capacity in vivo, not due to energetic limitations.</p><p>6) As stated by the authors, the MRI R1 is sensitive to both oxygen and ROS concentrations. These do not necessarily go in the same direction (see for instance Quarrie R et al. (2014) Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol. 307:H996-H1004). Which molecules contribute more to the R1 signal?

Is the B6 strain used in the present study the same as the C57BL/6J strain that has a truncated version of the Nnt gene that codes for mitochondrial nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase? If so, could this be the reason in the different patterns reported between the S6 and B6 strain?</p><p>Response: Our results from retina in vivo are consistent with the results from the Quarrie reference in cardiac tissue ex vivo which showed that pharmacologically increasing H+ leak decreases mitochondrial ROS production if measured before an episode of ischemia-reperfusion (citation added to the introduction). We also note that both oxygen and free radicals are paramagnetic and thus at their low in vivo concentrations will alter R1 in the same direction (but to different extents). The R1 of different ROS is not known at present and also we don&#x02019;t know the mixture of ROS that are impacting R1. Thus, it is unclear whether ROS or oxygen contribute more to the R1 signal. The third paragraph has been modified accordingly. We had somehow missed the important information about B6 mice lacking the Nnt gene (thank you!) and have added information to the 6th paragraph of the discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is an important study from a group that has developed unique MRI-based methods and used them together with OCT to quantify and characterize distributions of O2, free radicals and water in mouse eyes.
