Non-medical switch requests most often occur due to formulary changes implemented by an insurance company in order to lower their acquisition cost for prescription medications [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Due to the interplay between patients, physician practices, pharmacies and insurance companies, the process by which a patient and their physician need to respond to a non-medical switch request (either accepting or challenging it) to assure adequate and uninterrupted treatment becomes complex and time consuming (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225867.s001">S1 Fig</xref></italic></bold>). This complex process misaligns with the widely accepted goal&#x02014;The Quadruple Aim&#x02014;of enhancing patient experience, improving population health, reducing costs and improving the work life of healthcare providers, including physicians and staff [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Non-medical switching, while decreasing acquisition costs for prescription medications, has been associated with unintended negative consequences on patients&#x02019; clinical outcomes, healthcare utilization and medication adherence/persistence, physician-patient relationship, practice burden and physician and staff morale [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As a result, non-medical switching has been addressed in guidance documents and position statements released by the American Medical Association (AMA) as well as other medical societies, government entities and patient advocacy groups [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225867.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225867.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Physicians have first-hand experience with the impact of non-medical switching on both their own practice dynamics and patient care. Therefore, we sought to examine the openness of physicians to requests for non-medical switching of pharmaceutical medications, as well as their experiences, opinions and perceptions of the impact of non-medical switching has on their clinical decision making, practice, office staff and patients they care for.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Survey development and testing</title><p>The present study used a cross-sectional survey design. The initial version of the survey was developed by investigators after conducting exploratory interviews and a literature search for non-medical switching studies and existing guideline/policy statements. After the draft survey instrument was developed, we conducted 90-minute web-assisted pre-test interviews with 5 screened-in physicians (3 primary care providers and 2 specialists) for further refinement. These physicians were asked questions about the content of the survey (clarity, response options, relevance and comprehensiveness). These physicians were compensated at fair market value rates for 90 minutes of their time and survey feedback. The qualitative interviews were not conducted for the purpose of content validation as survey questions were not developed with the intention to measure specific constructs via an instrument. As such, content validity ratios or indices and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha (internal consistency) were not calculated for this study. The final survey included questions addressing 3 general (non-disease or medication specific) physician perspective domains on non-medical switching including: 1) clinical decision-making process (amenability and factors influencing amenability to the change and frequency and success of challenges); 2) professional experience with clinical practice, patient-physician relationship and insurance process; and 3) perceived impact on practice, staff and patients (effect on office administration, staffing, workflow, morale and patient outcomes including access to medication, health status, healthcare utilization and confidence in physician care). An additional set of questions were administered to collect data regarding physicians&#x02019; demographics and professional background. Only one survey question (or question block) was displayed per screen; resulting in a maximum of 58 unique screens for the on-line survey (including survey instructions and follow-up questions). Participants were allowed to change their responses until they submitted the survey. The survey (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225867.s002">S1 Appendix</xref></italic>)</bold> was programmed into an online survey platform, Decipher (FocusVision, New York, New York, USA) where internal link testing and testing in a small sample of respondents (&#x02264;10) were performed prior to full deployment. Pathways were tested to ensure participant links were correctly directing them to the survey and that those who completed the screener versus those who terminated were properly directed to the registration or termination screen.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Sample and survey administration</title><p>A double &#x0201c;opt-in&#x0201d; (consent to participate) process was utilized for this internet e-survey. Physician participants were identified and recruited by Research Now-SSI (RN-SSI), a global market research firm that has a voluntary US panel. RN-SSI&#x02019;s physicians have been recruited into their panel via state licensing data and professional associations including the AMA. Participating physicians maintain the opportunity to opt-in to the panel (ie, consent to be contacted for study opportunities). In the present study, a sample of physicians from the RN-SSI panel approximately equally represented across US census geographic regions were randomly selected and sent an email invitation to opt-in to participate in this specific survey. Because participants had already consented to participate in the RN-SSI physician panel and also opted-in to the complete the survey, the need for an additional consent form was waived by an independent institutional review board (IRB) (Solutions IRB, Yarnell, AZ, USA, protocol identification number: 2018/10/8). The purpose of the study was clearly stated in the invitation email. Participants were first required to complete screener questions in order to determine whether they met the present study&#x02019;s inclusion criteria including being a licensed physician currently practicing (post-residency and/or fellowship &#x0003e;2 years but &#x0003c;30 years) in a general practice, internal medicine, family medicine or specialist setting; spending a minimum of 10% of their professional time providing direct patient care and had received a request for a non-medical switch for at least 1 patient in prior 12-months. All eligible participants based on the screener questions were invited to complete the online survey. Recruitment quotas were set to meet a total <italic>a priori</italic> determined sample size of 1,000 primary care and specialist physicians (based on a prior AMA survey study of physicians regarding prior authorization) [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A sampling ratio of 60% primary care/40% specialist physicians was chosen (despite primary care physicians making up less than one-third of active physicians) because of the ~990 million ambulatory care visits Americans undergo annually, 51% are with primary care physicians [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Participants were informed the online survey would take approximately 15&#x02013;20 minutes to complete and physicians received an honorarium of $35 (primary care) or $45 (specialists) upon completion. The survey was fielded from November to December 2018 and remained active until sample size goals were reached. The online survey was designed in such a manner to reduce missing responses, biases (randomization of item responses) and respondent burden (adaptive questioning/skipping to reduce the number and complexity of questions). To ensure the integrity of our data collection, at the end of the survey each respondent was asked to select only the numbers &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;8&#x0201d; from a listing of numbers ranging 1&#x02013;10; with a failure to do so resulting in respondents&#x02019; exclusion from the results.</p><p>Investigators were blinded to all respondents in order to remain compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and participants were blinded to the study sponsor (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Titusville, NJ, USA) (i.e., double blinding was performed). Only RN-SSI had access to identifying information. This data was stored on a secure system and was not provided in any form to study investigators. Each respondent was assigned a unique ID for data analysis purposes. Investigators did not have access to any participant identifying information other than their basic demographic information collected as part of the survey. This study was approved by the IRB and reporting of results follow the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES)[<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data storage</title><p>Xcenda hosted the survey and developed a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA)-based compendium of results.

For each survey question, we collapsed the native ordinal Likert scale response into 2 (if no neutral response was possible) or 3 (when a neutral response was possible) level categorical responses by merging responses at the highest and lowest ends of Likert scales in aid in the interpretability of our results. We constructed study specific post-stratification weights to adjust for differential sampling rates and nonresponse by physician type (primary care, specialist) [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Weighted percentages of physician responses with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported separately for each question. No missing data were imputed.

First, physicians are generally not fully open to requests for non-medical switching for many reasons, with physicians reporting patient&#x02019;s stability on current medication as a critical factor influencing their decision to challenge a switch. Most physicians are either not open to (and will claim they would challenge a request) or have reservations regarding the switch. Despite physician reservations, non-medical switch requests are infrequently challenged; and when challenges occur, they appear as likely to fail as to succeed. Second, non-medical switching forces physicians to compromise their ethics as they frequently reported it undermined their autonomy and ability to treat patients in a cost-effective manner that is consistent with guidelines. Physicians also expressed concerns that non-medical switching negatively impacted patients&#x02019; trust in their care. Thirdly, physicians frequently reported that the practice of non-medical switching has a mostly negative impact on their practices and office morale. Most notably, non-medical switching required physicians to expend their staffs&#x02019; and own valuable time and resources to accommodate a switch request or navigate the complex challenge process. Finally, physicians felt non-medical switching negatively impacted patient care through increasing patient risk for side effects and medication errors, increasing patient out-of-pocket costs, increasing resource utilization and negatively influencing patient medication-taking behaviour (increasing medication abandonment, lowering adherence).</p><p>As the Quadruple Aim [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] emphasizes the partnership between patient and care team; the practice of non-medical switching threatens to disrupt the collaborative process of clinical decision-making between patient and physician. It has been previously demonstrated in a 2018 survey performed by the Alliance for the Adoption of Innovations of Medicine [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that 57% of patients trust their physicians above all others when making treatment decisions, and overwhelmingly (87%) want insurers to play a secondary (or no) role in clinical decision-making, and yet, the practice of non-medical switching undermines this [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, in that same survey, 65% of physicians reported concerns regarding &#x0201c;greater legal risks&#x0201d; due to insurer policies including non-medical switching [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Our study found decreased physician autonomy in practice and a loss of patient trust to be frequent consequences of non-medical switching, and these losses have been associated with physician burnout [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Physician burnout has been labelled a &#x0201c;public health crisis&#x0201d; that urgently requires action by healthcare institutions, governing bodies and regulatory authorities. Notably, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) have acknowledged that physicians are highly burdened by non-medical switching and other non-patient-care tasks and have subsequently launched burden reduction initiatives [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225867.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is estimated costs attributable to burnout are ~$4.6 billion per year in the US [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. One recommended action to reduce physician burnout is reducing or streamlining insurance company processes [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Non-medical switching has been addressed by numerous stakeholders through guidance and position statements [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225867.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225867.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Most notably, the AMA strongly discourages non-medical switching for ambulatory patients with chronic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and has provided recommendations to protect patients&#x02019; continuity-of-care, and ultimately improve patient health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One such recommendation includes requiring that if a medication is removed from formulary after the beneficiary enrollment period is over, it should be covered for the duration of the benefit year to provide a buffer period for patients [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Multiple states have passed, and others have at least introduced, similar legislation [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Numerous studies have suggested a negative link between of non-medical switching and patient outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nguyen and colleagues conducted a systematic review and identified 29 studies published between January 2000 and November 2015 that evaluated the impact of non-medical switching on health outcomes. Within identified studies, the impact of non-medical switching on a total of 96 separate health outcomes (60.4% clinical, 21.9% resource utilization, 13.5% economic, 4.2% medication-taking behaviour) was assessed. The investigators found that the effect of non-medical switching on outcomes was more frequently negative (33.3%) or neutral (55.2%) than positive (11.5%). In our survey, physician respondents highlighted their concern that non-medical switching can result in treatment inconsistent with accepted clinical guidelines and worsened outcomes in their patients. Moreover, our respondents&#x02019; assessment of increased healthcare utilization due to non-medical switching reflects a move in the wrong direction in this era of ever-increasing fiscal stewardship in healthcare.</p><p>While our study surveyed only physicians, a prior survey of patients to gain insight into patients&#x02019; impressions of non-medical switching has also been conducted [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this survey of 143 patients performed by a special commission established by the Massachusetts Legislature; 70% of patient respondents reported experiencing decreased effectiveness, 86% reported worse side effects and 48% reported having to try multiple medications before finding an alternative that worked after a non-medical switch. Of note, nearly all of respondents (94%) stated they were in favor of legislation that would prohibit insurers from financially pressuring them to switch medications for non-medical reasons. Our physician respondents&#x02019; perceptions of the challenges facing their patients when presented with a non-medical switch mirror these patient responses.</p><p>Our study has several limitations worth discussing. First, as with any self-reported response survey, social desirability bias (whereby respondents answer questions in a manner that they feel will be viewed positively by others) may exist. Next, it is possible that both nonresponse bias [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225867.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and our sampling ratio of 60% primary care/40% specialist physicians may have impacted our survey&#x02019;s results and their generalizability. Importantly, we achieved a reasonable response rate for a physician survey [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, we constructed study-specific post-stratification weights to adjust for nonresponse by physician type and differential sampling rates [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The latter required we estimate the proportion of active physicians in the US providing direct patient care that have a primary care (versus specialist) practice. While this data is available [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225867.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], there is some variation in estimates across studies, with values ranging between 21.1% and 47.7% [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225867.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We utilized a value of 30% for the proportion of physicians classifying themselves as primary care based upon the &#x0201c;2018 Physician Specialty Data Report&#x0201d; published by the Association of American Medical Colleges [<xref rid="pone.0225867.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which used the AMA&#x02019;s 2018 Physician Masterfile (data as of December 31, 2017) as its primary data source. Thirdly, our study did not focus on a specific therapeutic indication and we cannot rule out that physicians&#x02019; opinions regarding non-medical switching varies by medication type. We did attempt to survey a broad set of physicians in this study including those practicing in different primary care settings as well as across multiple medical specialties. Fourth, to avoid respondent burden (and help achieve acceptable response rates), we used adaptive questioning, limited the number of questions in each domain and did not offer respondents the opportunity to provide an explanation or more nuanced response. Fifth, while we collapsed the 5- and 7-point Likert scales to improve interpretability of our survey&#x02019;s results, this practice does come at the cost of lost information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study suggests physicians are often not open to or have reservations regarding insurance company requests for a non-medical switch. Non-medical switching results in a burden on physicians and their office staff. Requests for non-medical switches, the complexity of understanding and challenging a non-medical switch, as well as, associated ethical concerns appear to result in physician frustration. Many physicians believe they expend valuable time and resources addressing non-medical switch requests; which at least in part, may explain the infrequency in which such requests are challenged. Physicians also believe non-medical switching has some negative impacts on overall patient care, clinical outcomes and resource utilization. These data should be interpreted in context to important survey limitations including that these are physicians opinions (and association between non-medical switching and outcomes was not validated using real-world utilization data), response rate and generalizability to all US physicians as a group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0225867.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Analytic framework describing the interplay between patients, physician practices, pharmacies and insurance companies due to a request for a non-medical switch of a prescription medication.</title><p>The above analytic framework was developed to guide the discussion for the exploratory interviews used for survey development.
