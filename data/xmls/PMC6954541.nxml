Patients were in a late palliative phase and received palliative homecare. Each patient proposed one relative. Data were collected using a modified version of the Quality from the Patients&#x02019; Perspective instrument (QPP), which focuses on security and comprises three dimensions: medical-technical competence, identity-orientation approach and physical-technical conditions. Context-specific scales containing four aspects (competence, continuity, coordination/cooperation, availability) were added.

Data were analysed by descriptive statistics, Chi-squared test, T-test and Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed rank test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">Patients had high mean scores on the PR-scale for the sense of security in palliative homecare in the dimensions of medical-technical competence and physical-technical conditions.

Quality palliative care is important for meeting the needs of patients in a palliative phase of their illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], as they often suffer pain and other symptoms, loss of bodily and psychological functions and social relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The World Health Assembly has indicated that health systems have an ethical responsibility to provide palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], for instance to meet the preferences of patients who want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or die there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is in line with the statement of the WHO that palliative care should be integrated into primary health care in the municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Norway, where the present study was conducted, the policy in recent years has been to replace hospital-based care and treatment with community health care in or close to patients&#x02019; homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">A relative is often the key to meeting the patients&#x02019; preferences as well as achieving political aims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many relatives take on the responsibility for providing practical and medical care, in addition to social and emotional support, while at the same time facing the threat of losing a loved one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The consequences can be contradictory: a perception of performing a meaningful mission and a feeling of reward by contributing to the fulfilment of the patient&#x02019;s preferences, while at the same time physical and psychological stress and health problems may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The above-mentioned concurrent preferences of patients and relatives as well as the intentions of society imply the need to focus on quality in palliative homecare.</p><p id="Par21">A sense of security is reported to be an aspect of quality care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and a key component of palliative homecare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Studies have revealed that patients and relatives&#x02019; perceptions of security in homecare were fairly similar and encompassed a trusting relationship with the nurse, feeling respected, recognized, informed and being involved in the treatment and care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It was also important to live as normal an everyday life as possible and that the healthcare professionals were reliable, competent and available when needed.

The Norwegian municipalities (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;422) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] are responsible for providing homecare services for the population (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.3 million) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Homecare services include homecare nursing and practical assistance to meet the needs of each patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Palliative care is organised in specialised and non-specialised services, where mainly the latter serve patients in the municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This means that the healthcare professionals care for all patients who need homecare, including those who require palliative care.</p><p id="Par27">The participants in this study were recruited from an urban municipality with about 30,000 inhabitants in the southeast of Norway. The homecare is organized in self-directed work teams (SDWT) on day and evening shifts. The basic idea behind a SDWT is that the team members are empowered and organize the service to meet the needs of the patients and their relatives, while ensuring optimal utilization of resources, continuity of care and appropriate competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A SDWT consists of a small group of healthcare professionals, including one who has the role of primary contact, which means that she/he provides daily care to &#x0201c;her/his&#x0201d; patient, including planning, evaluation and documentation.</p><p id="Par28">There are three palliative SDWTs in the municipality, each of which cares for an average of 28 patients. They not only cover patients in the early or late palliative phase or terminal phase, but also seriously ill patients who are receiving curative treatment. A SDWT is made up of five registered nurses (RNs), of whom at least one has a specialist education in oncology nursing, two enrolled nurses and one assistant without any health education. A registered nurse (RN) who is responsible for organising the daily care leads each SDWT. The palliative SDWTs are non-specialised because they are not fully staffed by healthcare professionals, thus do not provide a multidisciplinary palliative approach. The patient&#x02019;s general practitioner or physicians at the hospital deal with medical aspects during the day. In the evening, at night, on weekends and holidays this becomes the responsibility of physicians at the emergency department.</p><p id="Par29">Two RNs specialised in oncology nursing work across the SDWTs to support seriously ill and dying patients and their family members as well as supervising the SDWT members.

The patients were consecutively sampled by the SDWT leaders. About 95 were excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria 2, 3, 4, 6 and because the SDWT leaders reported a heavy workload and thus forgot to invite patients to participate. Of the 85 patients who were asked to participate, four refused immediately, 16 failed to return the written consent and five died before the interview took place. Forty-three patients gave their consent to ask their relatives to participate and 38 relatives returned the questionnaire.

The theoretical framework includes four quality of care dimensions: the medical-technical competence of the caregiver (MT), the physical-technical conditions of the care organisation (PT), identity-orientation in caregivers&#x02019; attitudes and actions (ID) and the socio-cultural atmosphere of the care organisation (SC) (56 items full version) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Eighteen new items were added as context-specific security-related scales representing the following four aspects: competence (4 items), continuity (4 items), coordination/cooperation (4 items) and availability (6 items).

The statements were rated on a four-point Likert type scale. For the PR statement the scale was 1 (totally insecure), 2 (fairly insecure), 3 (fairly secure), 4 (totally secure) and for the SI statement the scale was 1 (of no importance), 2 (of some importance), 3 (of great importance), 4 (of very great importance).

However, this study provides a detailed presentation of reliability coefficients (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

This study from a Norwegian municipality describes the sense of security in palliative homecare, including the care received (PR) and the subjective importance of that care (SI) as perceived by groups of patients and relatives and patient-relative dyads.</p><p id="Par56">Thirteen of the 32 patients in the present study lived alone. Despite the fact that the number of participants is low, it is worth mentioning that many patients live alone, even in the palliative phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We need to be aware that changes in family structures from extended to nuclear families in western society will lead to more people, especially older ones, living alone. In Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], including Scandinavia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], loneliness is a growing health problem. Patients in the late palliative phase often require comprehensive assistance due to their complex needs, and their relatives are referred to as the glue in the patients&#x02019; palliative homecare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Even if patients have family members who want to help, they may be busy with other obligations such as work, home and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. It can therefore be challenging for patients to remain at home for as long as they would like. It has been found that older patients with cancer who live alone make plans for death, but not for dying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This underlines the need for healthcare professionals to focus on advanced care planning, especially for patients living alone, taking account of the fact that care aid support and health technology can have the potential to provide them with a sense of security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Furthermore, cohabitation of patients/relatives has been shown to either affect agreement about the perceptions of the quality of care positively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or not at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. More studies are needed about what and how demographic aspects influence patients/relatives&#x02019; perceptions of security in palliative homecare.</p><p id="Par57">The present study shows differences within patient-relative dyads when assessing the sense of security in the palliative care received, with significantly lower scores from relatives in all three dimensions (Medical-Technical competence (MT), Physical-Technical conditions (PT), Identity-Orientation (ID)) and in one aspect (coordination/cooperation).</p><p id="Par58">The MT dimension is about medical treatment and care, a field that is often complex for patients in the late palliative phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Effective pain and symptom control for these patients is of the utmost importance and both patients and relatives need to be able to rely on the high quality of palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, studies have shown that older patients with cancer have lower priorities for palliative care than younger ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and that medication errors are common in homecare and can lead to patient harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. There is a great deal of knowledge available about these issues and we consider that it is time to ensure competent help with pain and symptoms, regardless of the age and location of patients in the palliative phase. If relatives perceive inadequate treatment and care, they may have to fill the gap. A lower sense of security may put them at greater risk of illness because of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], physical and psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and fear of being unable to cope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Even 1 year after a patient&#x02019;s death, relatives&#x02019; well-being has been shown to be predicted by their sense of security during the palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. A sense of security in palliative homecare is therefore important for ensuring the achievement of political goals to prevent illness in relatives and fulfil the wishes of those patients who want to remain at home for as long as possible and/or die there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. It is necessary for healthcare professionals to routinely clarify relatives&#x02019; sense of security in the care and treatment as well as identify and meet their support needs.</p><p id="Par59">The ID dimension concerns communication, respect, empathy, information and involvement. The latter is fundamental in modern health services, as well as for patients in the palliative phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and their relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. It is important that relatives are not made to feel like spectators in the patient&#x02019;s palliative treatment and care. Being involved in decision-making can improve relatives&#x02019; satisfaction with the quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], increase the possibilities of receiving care tailored to the patient&#x02019;s specific needs and preferences and adapted to family life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Even if healthcare professionals may find it challenging, they must overcome the barriers to involving patients and relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The present study highlights the need to further develop healthcare professionals&#x02019; competence in this area and future studies are required in order to learn more about what issues patients and relatives perceive as important and their views on the best way of being involved.</p><p id="Par60">Involvement presupposes information. According to Norwegian law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] and The guide for next of kin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], healthcare professionals need the patient&#x02019;s consent before giving information about her/his health and care to relatives. However, this should not hinder nurses and physicians from communicating with relatives in a general way about treatment and care, their own situation and their support needs. For instance, both patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] have reported that they prefer information about the expected course of the illness. However, healthcare professionals may feel uncomfortable about discussing end-of-life issues with patients and relatives because of feeling unprepared as well as worry about destroying hope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Nevertheless, in order to meet relatives&#x02019; information needs, healthcare professionals should investigate what they can tell them about the patient&#x02019;s situation and what patients and relatives want to know. Lack of information has been found to cause frustration, powerlessness and loss of control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">Professional communication about end-of-life questions assumes highly competent and sensitive professionals. In general, this is challenging in Norwegian community healthcare, where competence is relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. However, in the present study, patients and relatives perceived that they were fairly secure concerning the professionals&#x02019; competence. This might be due to the organization, which aims to staff the SDWTs with healthcare professionals who are competent in palliative care. Nevertheless, there are variations and we know that adequate competence is not always available at night, or on weekends and holidays. It is necessary to bring palliative competence to those who need it in urban and rural areas 24/7. Due to scarce resources in Norwegian community care, it is essential to consider increased use of tele-health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], not as a substitute for, but as a complement to healthcare professionals.</p><p id="Par62">Patients rated one dimension and one aspect higher on the SI- than on the PR scale, whereas relatives rated all dimensions and aspects higher. This is in accordance with another study about quality of care among dyads of patients with lung cancer-family members, which found that family members generally rated the importance of the care higher than the patients and the SI higher than the PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A common understanding of patient-relative care preferences can facilitate adaption to the situation, whereas diverging perceptions can lead to conflicts. For instance, it is reported that relatives may diverge from patients in their preference for homecare services; patients may prefer to stay at home without help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], whereas relatives expect that homecare services may ease their responsibilities as caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Knowing what is important to patients and relatives is essential for guiding politicians and leaders in planning and prioritizing future palliative homecare, as well as for enabling healthcare professionals to provide palliative care in accordance with decisions and promises. More studies are needed about these issues with a larger sample of patient-relative dyads.</p><p id="Par63">One intention of SDWTs is to ensure continuity. Therefore, it was surprising to find that both patients and relatives scored the aspect of continuity in the care received as &#x0201c;fairly insecure&#x0201d; (PR scale) and of &#x0201c;great importance&#x0201d; on the SI scale. Another study has shown that patients and their families perceived lack of continuity as problematic because unknown healthcare professionals who were unfamiliar with their needs made the care unpredictable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Other studies have found that visits by different healthcare professionals are relatively unproblematic. They report that the most important aspect for patients and their families is that the care is perceived as secure and of high quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], which presupposes competent and available palliative homecare teams 24/7 and that they know the healthcare professionals involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. We suggest that future research should explore which palliative homecare models are appropriate for ensuring easily accessible and competent assistance.</p><p id="Par64">Another aim of SDWTs is to assign each patient a primary contact. The primary contact is intended to contribute to continuity of care by being well informed and responsible for updating the documentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], which has been found to be appreciated by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. It was therefore surprising that many patients and relatives in the present study reported that they lacked a primary contact and did not know how to obtain help if something unanticipated should happen. This underlines the importance of leaders ensuring that practice is in accordance with decisions and policy.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p id="Par65">The number of participants in the present study is low. However, they represent dyads in a vulnerable group and as such, the sample is not that small. Although patients with different diagnoses are represented, they are not fully representative of the population of patients in the late palliative phase. Furthermore, the sample is from one municipality and the results cannot be generalised, but they can nevertheless provide managers and politicians with important information for future planning to improve the service. Other municipalities might also find the results informative and useful for developing the quality of palliative homecare.</p><p id="Par66">Despite the fact that the first author (RH) was in regular contact with the SDWT leaders to remind them about the study and answer their questions about inclusion, it is possible that not all eligible patients were invited to participate. Therefore, the results should be treated with care. Nevertheless, the study may provide a valuable contribution to those who deliver and are responsible for developing palliative homecare.</p><p id="Par67">At the time the study was designed (2013), few studies were found on the sense of security in palliative homecare comprising both patients and relatives and none that included both the care received and its subjective importance. We therefore chose to develop a modified version of the original QPP. Recently, other instruments have been designed to measure the quality of palliative care from the patient perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] as well as the sense of security in palliative care among patients and their family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The modified QPP developed in this study aimed to measure perceptions of security and contains the main areas from these instruments. It should be noted that it also adds the subjective importance scale to the instruments about security and basically rests on the theoretical foundation of the original QPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">The absence of knowledge about the psychometric properties of the modified version of the QPP used in this study calls for caution when interpreting the results. However, it should be noted that 21 out of 24 Cronbach alpha coefficients were 0.70 or higher. The mean scores presented in this study are slightly higher (visual inspection) than the results obtained in a previous study in palliative care settings in Norway using the QPP-palliative care instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The differences may be explained by the organisation of homecare in palliative SDWTs in the present study, whereas in the other study personnel were not specifically allocated to caring for patients in the palliative phase, but cared for all patients in need of homecare.</p><p id="Par69">Data collection methods may influence answers about perceptions of security in palliative care. While the relatives completed the questionnaire themselves, all patients had help filling it in. As the interviews took place in the home, the patients could find the most comfortable position and were told that they could take a break whenever they needed. The two researchers (BB, RH) who conducted the interviews and filled in the questionnaire were not employed in the municipality. They assured the patients that their answers would not influence their care. To ensure that the patient and relative answered from the same care period, the data collection was timed as closely as possible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par70">This study shows both high and low values in patients&#x02019; perceptions of security in the palliative homecare received (PR), whereas there are no high scores from relatives. The patients scored the subjective importance of the care (SI) higher than PR in one dimension (ID) and one aspect (continuity), whereas relatives&#x02019; scores differed in all dimensions and aspects. When assessing the palliative care received, the study reveals that there was limited agreement within the patient-relative dyads on all three dimensions and on the aspect of coordination/cooperation. Studies about the sense of security in palliative homecare from the perspectives of patient-relative dyads are important as relatives often provide care and act as a spokesperson for the patient, but also because relatives themselves are in a stressful situation. What patients and relatives assess as important in palliative homecare can guide the further development of this area. The present study adds knowledge that can contribute to concrete aspects of security in palliative homecare. More studies with a larger sample are required to further develop the QPP Security instrument.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Appendix</title><p id="Par77">
