This can be used to extrapolate the dating of large-scale settlement plans derived from, among other methods, geophysical surveys. In the southwest Slovakian settlement of Vr&#x000e1;ble, we observed a progressive counter-clockwise rotation in house orientation from roughly 32&#x000b0; to 4&#x000b0; over a 300 year period. A survey of published and dated village plans from other LBK regions confirms that this counter-clockwise rotation per settlement is a wider Central European trend. We explain this observation as an unintentional, unconscious but systematic leftward deviation in the house builders&#x02019; cardinal orientation, which has been termed &#x0201c;pseudoneglect&#x0201d; in studies of human perception. This means that whenever houses were intended to be oriented towards a specific direction and be parallel to each other, there was an error in perception causing slight counter-clockwise rotation. This observation is used as a basis to reconstruct dynamics of Early Neolithic settlement in the Slovakian &#x0017d;itava valley, showing a rapid colonization, followed by increased agglomeration into large villages consisting of strongly autonomous farmsteads.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Projektnummer 2901391021 &#x02013; SFB 1266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furholt</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Projektnummer 2901391021 &#x02013; SFB 1266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rabbel</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006109</institution-id><institution>Vedeck&#x000e1; Grantov&#x000e1; Agent&#x000fa;ra M&#x00160;VVa&#x00160; SR a SAV</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2/0107/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheben</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation; project no. 2901391021 &#x02013; SFB 1266; PIs: J.

Within European archaeology, among others, this is especially relevant for the reconstruction of Chalcolithic mega-settlements of eastern Europe [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], Neolithic enclosures all over Europe [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and also settlements of the earliest Neolithic group in Central Europe, the so-called <italic>Linearbandkeramik</italic> (LBK) (e. g., [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226082.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]).</p><p>Using excavation results and Bayesian dating and combining this chronological information with magnetic plans, we propose that it is possible to make substantial claims about the settlement history of a whole region without the need to excavate large areas. As Bayesian <sup>14</sup>C-calibration shows that the orientation of houses follows a chronological order, orientation can be used as a proxy for the chronological order of houses. We see the change in orientation as the concrete outcome of a neurobiological phenomenon, pseudoneglect, which hitherto has been attested only in laboratory studies. The pseudoneglect hypothesis is relevant where there are no other stronger constrains influencing building activities (topography, circular arrangement of houses, proximity of houses, but also social factors like overarching authorities, etc.).</p><p>Our study takes the so-called <italic>Linearbandkeramik</italic> as example, which is inextricably linked with the onset of Neolithic lifeways in Central Europe at around 5300 cal BCE. What sets LBK settlements apart from any other archaeological culture, is their use of very characteristic long houses. These are massive buildings of lengths of 30 meters and more, the roof supported by solid posts of oak, always set in cross-rows of three. Additionally, the houses are uniquely marked by long clay extraction and refuse pits at each side. These characteristics make LBK settlements and houses easily identifiable within magnetic surveys and an ideal test-case for our approach.</p><p>Especially huge rescue excavations like that on the Aldenhovener Platte have pioneered large-scale settlement studies in terms of settlement systems and networks of the LBK. They are, however, mostly still based on typochronological instead of scientific dating methods [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226082.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as the excavations were already done before the main <sup>14</sup>C-boom in archaeology. In other cases, larger geophysical surveys combined with small-scale excavations have produced important insights into the general layout of LBK houses and settlements [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226082.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, without the extremely time-consuming large-scale excavations such as those carried out on the Aldenhovener Platte, the understanding of the diachronic developments of the settlements are necessarily much coarser (e. g., [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] for the Wetterau in Central Germany). Therefore, we propose a new approach to understanding the chronological development of large-scale settlements without extensive excavation: dating by house orientation.</p><p>The idea that house orientation holds significance has been around for a long time in LBK research, but the discussion of regional differences in orientation always trumped considerations of variance in house orientation at individual sites (for an overview of approaches to orientation of LBK houses see [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], 529ff.). It is, however, at the local, site-specific level that house orientation can be used for relative chronological dating. Therefore, we are not interested in the differences in orientation of houses between, say, Slovakia and the Alsace, but only in those differences per site or per micro-region.</p><p>E. Sangmeister ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], 91ff.) was the first to point out the variation in house orientation within the same settlement. Taking the settlement of K&#x000f6;ln-Lindenthal as an example, he grouped the houses into seven classes of the same orientation (within 2&#x02013;3&#x000b0;) and postulated the contemporaneity of houses within these groups. Apart from the similar orientation, the fact that all houses of each group were found across the whole settlement was, in his eyes, a very strong argument. He assumed that the settlements were temporarily abandoned and, when resettled, the houses were built with a slightly different orientation ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226082.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], 454). Despite the fact that he found similar patterns in other settlements, his suggestion was never adopted and later was even refuted on the grounds of overlapping houses with the same orientation ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], 224f.) or ceramic typology ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], 106). However, taking magnetic prospections in southwest Slovakia as point of departure, we will show that the findings of Sangmeister should have been taken more seriously.</p><p>During our fieldwork in Vr&#x000e1;ble we conducted a comprehensive dating program and thus produced a dataset that is large enough to compare orientation and dating of houses in detail. A comparison of these two measures proves their correlation and the testing of this dating method at other sites suggests that orientation could play a key-role in deciphering the development of large-scale settlements as referred to above. Under certain conditions orientation could serve as a proxy for relative chronology, and in addition, when combined with small-scale excavations for <sup>14</sup>C-dating can also be integrated into the absolute chronology of a specific site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The &#x0017d;itava valley in southwest Slovakia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226082.g001">Fig 1</xref>) was settled during the first expansion of the LBK [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which is now assumed to have taken place after 5350 BC ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], 138).

The ceramic material unanimously date these houses to the youngest LBK, which is also supported by the 99 <sup>14</sup>C-dates obtained.

[<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) that the agreement between the excavated features and the magnetic picture is very high [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226082.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Because LBK houses are unique and easily identified by their characteristic long pits bracketing the long sides of the house, it seems permissible to reconstruct the number and placement of houses on the basis of the magnetic measurement. Therewith, size and orientation of houses can also be reasonably determined. This methodology has successfully also been applied elsewhere on LBK settlements (e. g. [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], 83 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226082.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p><p>It is likely that the actual number of houses in ancient times was higher than is estimated by this method. In some instances, long pits might have already eroded away, in others they might not be filled by significant amounts of material with high magnetic susceptibility. Finally there might be such a large degree of overlap between adjacent house pits that they are no longer distinguishable in the magnetic picture. All of these factors lead to an underestimation of house numbers, never to an overestimation. For the present context it is especially important that the orientation of houses is not be affected by these possible taphonomic processes.</p><p>Currently it is not possible to reliably identify archaeological features in magnetic plans automatically (for a semi-automatic approach see [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). This is due to the very low magnitude of signal of the features on the one hand, and the still greater variability of the signal on the other. Automatic classification thus leads either to the marking of only the most distinctive features or virtually the whole area, depending on the chosen sensitivity.</p><p>Therefore, it seemed more fruitful to perform an expert identification of features focusing first on delimiting the long pits and successively on the houses. For that purpose a polygon was drawn between two long pits seemingly belonging together based on orientation, position and length. This was done for each site by three of the authors (M. F., W. M., N. M.-S.) independently. Houses were only accepted which were identified by at least two of the authors, i.e. where the area of overlap between polygons drawn by different researchers was equal to at least half of the area of the largest polygon.</p><p>In order to avoid human measurement errors, the orientation of individual houses was calculated automatically. The orientation was determined by taking the average of the orientation of the long sides of each house as expressed by the reconstructed polygons (minimum number of long sides = 4 as at least two polygons identified by two experts per house). In this way, it is also possible to estimate the standard deviation of orientation for each house.</p><p>As it is normally not possible to identify an unequivocal single direction for houses, we reported orientations by their degree closest to true north. Thus, orientations range from 270&#x000b0; (west&#x02013;east) over 360&#x000b0;/0&#x000b0; (north&#x02013;south) to 89.9&#x000b0; (eastnortheast&#x02013;westsouthwest). According to this system, values between 90&#x000b0; and 269.9&#x000b0; cannot occur.</p><p>In previous studies, orientation data is usually aggregated by deviation from north (e.g. +10, -15) and by treating it like linear data. However, for directional data like the orientation of houses standard measures as used for linear data (like arithmetic mean) is inappropriate ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], 12). The calculation of average degree is very straightforward, though, when angles are transformed to vectors ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). All aggregated orientation data (average, standard deviation) reported in this paper therefore derives from calculations of vectors, except where otherwise noted (in cases of already tabulated data from other studies).</p><p>To understand the internal organizations of the settlements, we computed the distances between the Next Neighbors and also between all houses. For reasons of simplicity, we chose the centroid of each house as spatial representative.</p><sec id="sec003"><title><sup>14</sup>C-dates</title><p>From the 2014 excavations datable material was available for five houses of the northern settlement (for an in-depth-discussion of the <sup>14</sup>C-dates from Vr&#x000e1;ble see [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). In the southeastern settlement, seven houses yielded datable material during excavations in 2013 and 2016. Two further houses in the southeastern settlement were dated by charcoal samples from test cores. Because of a targeted coring program, the largest number of houses with the most even spatial distribution derives from the southwestern settlement. There, it was possible to extract suitable, short-lived material from cores for seven houses. In addition, three houses were investigated by excavation in the years 2012 and 2017. Of the 100 houses of the southwestern settlement, ten, i.e. 10%, are therefore datable. Considering all three settlements together, there is datable material from 24 houses. In relation to the 313 houses defined by the experts in the magnetic plan of this settlement cluster, this equals 8%.</p><p>It is a common opinion that the material in the long pits derives from the time after the initial construction of LBK houses. If they were filled during the use-life of the house or after the house&#x02019;s abandonment is a matter of debate [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Nevertheless, it should be obvious that simply taking the oldest date from each long pit would not be appropriate if we want to link the orientation of each house to the moment of its erection, especially as the number of <sup>14</sup>C-dates per house varies. Therefore, we decided to rely on the function &#x0201e;First&#x0201d;in the calibration tool OxCal v. 4.2.4 [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to generate simulated oldest dates for each house when two or more plausible dates are available. This was possible for 17 of the 24 dated houses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec004"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Identification of houses</title><p>As the result of the expert identification, a total of 581 anomalies in 13 sites were identified as LBK longhouses (<xref rid="pone.0226082.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Through excavation, we could demonstrate that this group of houses actually represents a time-depth of 200 years (5200&#x02013;5000 BCE).

Apparently an increase in the overall variability in orientation accompanies this process. The duration of a settlement&#x02019;s occupation, the density of houses within it, and the variability of orientation of houses seem to be connected. The fact that higher density of buildings is linked to increasingly deviating orientations between immediate neighbors implies that houses were usually not built very close to older houses, otherwise we would expect a closer alignment between the older and younger houses.</p><p>The fact that houses with similar orientations are found at regular intervals of 75 and 150 m is in our view a clear argument for the existence of house wards (&#x0201e;Hofplatzmodell&#x0201c;) as has been argued in the past [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. With a distance of 75 m (taking the value of 150 m as the double of the regular distance; for the methodology see [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) between contemporary houses, such a house ward would have encompassed roughly 0.5 ha. The buildings of one house ward were erected over time within this circumscribed area of 0.5 ha, resulting in the emergence of the described pattern as the buildings&#x02019; show more and more changes in their orientation.</p><p>The regression analysis of orientation and age at Vr&#x000e1;ble reveals that orientation shifted on average by between 0.03&#x000b0; (southeastern settlement), 0.13&#x000b0; (southwestern settlement) and 0.18&#x000b0; (northern settlement) per year or between 3&#x000b0;, 13&#x000b0; and 18&#x000b0; in 100 years. For the Vr&#x000e1;ble settlement as a whole the change amounts to 0.05&#x000b0; per year or 5&#x000b0; in 100 years.</p><p>The most reliable value can be attributed to the southwestern settlement as here, as already emphasized above, we have the best coverage. The fact that Bayesian <sup>14</sup>C-modeling implies a broad co-existence of the three settlements [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] correlates with the observation of very similar means of the orientation of houses (see above). Therefore, we argue that the differences in the regression analyses of the three settlements are due to uneven sampling and do not reflect fundamental different principles in orientating houses.</p><p>If we interpret the differing orientation as a proxy for the individual dating of houses, the spatial development of the settlement can be reconstructed both in time intervals and as a steady process. Consequently, interesting conclusions regarding the history of the southwestern settlement can be drawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226082.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Firstly, there is no clear spatial pattern visible concerning a possible direction of settlement development, say, from north to south or east to west. Already at the beginning of occupation, in the first phases, houses seem to cover almost the entire 14 ha area. This implies, secondly, that already at the very beginning of the settlement, the final size it would reach was implicitly or explicitly determined. This is not unlikely given that all three settlements in Vr&#x000e1;ble have the same size and shape. The only obvious exception is the northeastern-most part of the southwestern settlement where only houses with orientations less than or equal to 20&#x000b0; appear. Already judging by the settlement layout it was suspected that this appendix-like part of the settlement might be somewhat younger that the rest. The fact that the ditches, however, encircle even this appendix can be taken as a hint that the ditch system was erected only in the second half of the existence of Vr&#x000e1;ble, or even towards its end. Finally, after a modest beginning in the first two phases of occupation (c. 5275&#x02013;5225 BCE), the settlement remains at a densely populated level with 10 houses or more, and with even more than 20 houses in the phases representing orientations of &#x0003c;/ = 20&#x000b0; and &#x0003c;/ = 16 (c. 5150&#x02013;5100 BCE).</p><fig id="pone.0226082.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0226082.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Orientation of houses of the southwestern settlement of Vr&#x000e1;ble in steps of 4&#x000b0;.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0226082.g008"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Change in orientation in the &#x0017d;itava valley</title><p>Mapping the 4&#x000b0;-interval (roughly equalling phases of 40 years and thus the length of the occupation of individual houses [see above] between 5275&#x02013;4950 BCE) for all magnetically prospected settlements of the &#x0017d;itava-valley, we can model a chronological sequence in which a process of settlement concentration within this micro-region emerges (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226082.g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226082.g010">10</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0226082.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0226082.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Orientation of houses of the LBK-settlements of the &#x0017d;itava-valley in steps of 4&#x000b0;.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0226082.g009"/></fig><fig id="pone.0226082.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0226082.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Hypothetical settlement development in the &#x0017d;itava-valley based on house orientations and compared to KDE-modeled <sup>14</sup>C-dates (function &#x0201e;KDE_plot&#x0201d;of OxCal 4.3).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0226082.g010"/></fig><p>While the settlement of Vr&#x000e1;ble is&#x02013;apart from &#x000da;&#x0013e;any&#x02013;the only settlement that is present on all maps, it seems to have reached a remarkable position in terms of size only after approximately 100 years (orientation &#x0003c;/ = 24&#x000b0;, c. 5175 BCE). However, from then onwards it is the only settlement with more than 30 contemporary houses. This is especially clear in the last phases (orientation &#x0003c;/ = 8&#x000b0;, ca. 5025&#x02013;4950 BCE) where in most other sites of the &#x0017d;itava valley LBK-settlement seems to have ceased completely. The interpretation of the magnetic prospections thus underlines the special status of Vr&#x000e1;ble probably as a central site, comparable for example to Langweiler 8 in the well-researched Merzbachtal [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, it seems to have gained this prominent position only towards the end of the local LBK and at the expense of other settlements&#x02019; existence. In consequence, we are able to detect an agglomeration process of the local population.</p><p>The maps imply that the &#x0017d;itava valley was already fully settled when the settlements represented by magnetic plans were founded. Assuming a steady change in orientation, the houses depicted in the magnetic imagery can be hypothetically pin-pointed mainly to a duration of 300 years and the time-range 5250&#x02013;4950 calBC. According to<sup>14</sup>C-dates, the change from the so-called younger LBK (Notenkopfkeramik) to the &#x0017d;eliezovce-group, the youngest variant of local LBK, happened around 5200 calBC [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, some of the identified houses should belong to the Notenkopfkeramik phase. This is in accordance with ceramic surface finds which imply that older LBK settlements already reached even remote parts of the Upper &#x0017d;itava valley and its tributaries ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], 205 map 4 no. 36.59).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Explanation: Pseudoneglect</title><p>The supra-regional differences and tendencies in orientation across the LBK world have been the topic of intensive discussions in the past and have been explained with a wide variety of theories (climate/dominating wind directions: [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; home of the ancestors: [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; exposure to the sun: [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Astonishingly, the variability of house orientation within individual settlements was never investigated in more detail. As mentioned above, the suggestion by Sangmeister that variability in orientation could be due to chronological differences was never seriously considered or even explicitly refuted (see above). As we have shown, there is in fact a directed shift in orientation over time. However, this shift is so small that it seems very unlikely that the inhabitants of the houses and settlements would realistically have been aware of it. When we consider the maximum life-span of an LBK house of 25&#x02013;50 years (although there are scholars who maintain that these houses can last up to 100 years) [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), the average difference of house orientations in adjacent phases would be 3&#x02013;5&#x000b0;. This is barely perceptible when looking at a ground plan from above and would be virtually impossible to detect from the ground. It seems very unlikely that contemporary inhabitants of the settlements would have any chance to notice the difference. As a corollary, we highly suspect that the change in orientation happened unconsciously and therefore not deliberately.</p><p>We do not see any celestial body that could be held accountable for this phenomenon, as the starting orientations in the different areas of the LBK were very different. Moreover, similar processes were also observed in completely different archaeological contexts, e. g. in Iron Age houses ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], 14&#x02013;17) or Iron Age burials ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; here&#x02013;perhaps erroneously&#x02013;explained with the precession of the stars in the sky, though). Therefore, it seems most probable that a certain inclination in human perception lead to such a shift in the long-term.</p><p>Pseudoneglect could be the source of such an inclination. This term refers to the fact that neurologically healthy individuals typically privilege the left side of space (they &#x0201e;neglect&#x0201d;the right side) and hence bisect a horizontal line to the left of its veridical center (see [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] for an extensive meta-study). Accepting this explanation, it can be argued that humans faced with the task of erecting a new house at a certain distance from other houses and with the firm determination to align it exactly with these older houses, would, in the absence of devices for exact measurements, most certainly misperceive the intended orientation. Pseudoneglect would lead to a non-random deviation of the aimed-at orientation; the accomplished orientation would on average lie somewhat to the left of the true orientation which in the long run would translate into a counter-clockwise rotation of houses.</p><p>Differing from the original formulation by Sangmeister [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we do not claim that the change in orientation of houses is due to a complete abandonment and resettling of a certain settlement with a new orientation, but that the change happened on a continuous and constant basis, where individual house wards rebuilt their houses in a slightly and barely perceptible progressively counter-clockwise altered orientation due to pseudoneglect.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Caveats: Close proximity of houses</title><p>For the settlement Langweiler 8, it was considered that not contemporaneity, but the spatial proximity of houses was the primary reason for a similar orientation ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], 925). However, Mattheu&#x000df;er ([<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], 16) could show that the orientation of a specific house is not tied to that of the Nearest Neighbor (see also above). On the other hand, in those cases where groups of similar alignments exist, she speculates that sometimes new houses were built so close to older houses that they were forced to follow their orientations, causing alignment. As a result, the temporal differences would be blurred by spatial proximity.</p><p>Exactly such a case was encountered in Vr&#x000e1;ble in the 2016 excavation area. There, the magnetic picture seemed to imply three houses standing very close to each other with the same orientation (houses 131, 132, 133). As working hypothesis this situation was interpreted as a quarter and as perhaps a particularly well preserved example of a row-like arrangement of houses. However, during excavation it turned out that the houses were not contemporaneous, and that parts of their long pits stratigraphically intersect [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Not surprisingly, the raw and modeled <sup>14</sup>C-dates mirror this time-depth [<xref rid="pone.0226082.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, some of the houses from the 2016 excavation area are not in concordance with the orientation = dating hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226082.g006">Fig 6</xref>). However, such cases should be conceived as cautionary tales rather than grounds on which to abandon the hypothesis altogether.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Consequences</title><p>Our findings have fundamental consequences for the interpretation of large scale settlement plans. Even when accepting all possible caveats&#x02013;for example the possibility of adjacent but not contemporaneous houses acting as guides and thus obscuring the temporal effect&#x02013;the possibilities of investigating settlement plans without extensive excavations are intriguing. In the overwhelming majority of LBK-settlements, the excavation of all houses is neither possible nor desirable because of preservation considerations or financial constraints. The concentration on differences in orientation offers the possibility to still make substantial statements about the development of individual settlements or even micro-regions. In this regard, our conclusions in relation to the settlement history of the LBK &#x0017d;itava valley&#x02013;the deliberate planning of settlements from the beginning of occupation, contemporaneity of 10 households on average in Vr&#x000e1;ble, a demographic agglomeration process&#x02013;barely skim the realm of what is possible with intense geophysical surveys and targeted dating of features.</p><p>While our discussion was mainly focused on the interpretation of magnetic surveys, the possibility of interpretation is by no means limited to it. The availability of large-scale excavation plans offers the opportunity to extend the approach to this medium as has already demonstrated above with the example of Erkelenz-K&#x000fc;ckhoven.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that the shift in orientation of longhouses can be consistently documented at multiple archaeological sites of the Early Neolithic and that this shift has a chronological dimension. As explanation we propose that this is due to &#x0201a;pseudoneglect&#x02019; which is well documented in a multitude of laboratory studies as a neurobiological aspect of human perception. We hope that our findings will be put to the test in other contexts, archaeological as well as modern ones. Apart from controlled studies, we would expect to find similar developments in all situations where there is a continuity of built space and where the building and rebuilding process of houses is not governed by strict rules or overarching authorities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Sarah Martini for English proofreading of the manuscript and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0226082.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rassmann</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Videjko</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name>, editors. <source>Trypillia Mega-Sites and European prehistory 4100&#x02013;3400 BCE</source>. <publisher-loc>London; New York</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Routledge</publisher-name>; <year>2016</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0226082.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Melichar</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Neubauer</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>. <source>Mittelneolithische Kreisgrabenanlagen in Nieder&#x000f6;sterreich: Geophysikalisch-arch&#x000e4;ologische Prospektion&#x02014;ein interdisziplin&#x000e4;res Forschungsgebiet</source>. <publisher-loc>Wien</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Verlag der &#x000d6;sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften</publisher-name>; <year>2010</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0226082.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>. <article-title>S&#x000ed;dlisk&#x000e1; a s&#x000ed;dliskov&#x000e9; objekty na lokalite T&#x0011b;&#x00161;etice-Kyjovice &#x0201e;Sutny&#x0201d;z poh&#x0013e;adu geomagnetickeho prieskumu</article-title>. <source>Studia archaeologica Brunensia</source>. <year>2013</year>;<volume>18</volume>:<fpage>73</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>91</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0226082.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Posselt</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Saile</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>Magnetometerprospektion auf der bandkeramischen Siedlung von Zwi&#x00119;czyca</chapter-title> In: <name><surname>D&#x00119;biec</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, editor. <source>Zwi&#x00119;czyca 3: eine bandkeramische Siedlung am Wis&#x00142;ok</source>. <publisher-loc>Rzesz&#x000f3;w</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Oficyna Wyd.

First, the title is overly specific. Remember that PLoS ONe is not an archaeological journal. It has a broad scientific readership. Thus I would avoid using archaeological terms like Linearbandkeramik in the title. Second, I suggest that an introductory paragraph be added to show the reader the importance of this study and why the reader should be interested in it. Explain the nature of settlements with longhouses and situate them chronologically. Finally, the section labeled "Conclusion" should clearly state the conclusions rather than continue the discussion. The main conclusion is that the shift in orientation of longhouses can be consistently documented at multiple sites and that is has a chronological dimension. The proposed explanation is the psychological aspect of human perception. Obviously, this is a hypothesis rather than a conclusion, but you could point to some ways in which this hypothesis can be tested.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The approach is ok, if not - to a certain extend - without humerous aspects. However, personally, I am not convinced that this hypothesis really explains the long-known phenomenon of the gradual westward - or eastward in eastern Europe - shift of Early Neolithic long houses accross Europe. It was developed at this fascinating and absolutely outstanding site, where it makes some sense, if the site is considered in isolation. If, however, the entire data base is considered, there are numerous arguments against it. First and foremote is the regional variation considerable, also according to local topography. Then, at some sites we can observe shifts in west-ward orientation which is a counterargument against gradual visual misconception.</p><p>Lastly, the entrie argument of time-sinsitivity of house orientation is not new. I therefore strongly suggest to rephrase the argument in the sense that another hypothesis os offered, which has some power for the site of Vr&#x000e1;ble, but apparently has its weak points even for that very same site, as the authors themselves hesitantly admit (line 381-390).</p><p>This also requires a reformulation of the title, maybe :"A new hypothesis on the orientation of Early Neolithic long houses".</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Title (l. 1-2)</p><p>Both reviewers were unhappy with the title. On the one hand, it was deemed too specific (reviewer 1 + 2), on the other that it should be rephrased (reviewer 2). We followed both suggestions and rephrased the title completely.</p><p>Introduction (l. 32-75)</p><p>Reviewer 1 made the valuable suggestion to state in an additional introductory paragraph why the reader should be interested in the paper and to situate the study in time and space. We have added such a paragraph.</p><p>Conclusion (l. 393-414)</p><p>Reviewer 1 demanded that the conclusion should be really a conclusion and not an extension of the discussion, and that it should name additional avenues for testing the hypothesis. We have changed the conclusion accordingly.</p><p>Hypothesis &#x0201e;Change in orientation&#x0201c;</p><p>Reviewer 2 criticizes that &#x0201e;the entire argument of time-sensitivity of house orientation is not new&#x0201c;. We do not claim to have invented this hypothesis but on the contrary discuss the early suggestions by E. Sangmeister. But, in contrast to Sangmeister, we are able to present data to underpin the hypothesis.</p><p>Reviewer 2 states that s/he is not convinced by our line of argument at all. We would like to point out that obviously s/he misconceived some of our arguments. First and foremost, we do not deal with &#x0201e;the long-known phenomenon of the gradual westward - or eastward in eastern Europe - shift of Early Neolithic long houses accross Europe.&#x0201c; We only look at change in orientation PER SITE (or small scale region, in the case of the Merzbachtal).</p><p>We completely agree that &#x0201e;the regional variation [is] considerable&#x0201c; but in our view the question why this is the case is a completely different topic. Local studies explicating &#x0201e;jumps&#x0201c; in orientation concern, for example, the surrounding of Dresden (Link Th [2011] B&#x000f6;hmische D&#x000f6;rfer? Zur Stellung der Dresdener Elbtalweitung zwischen s&#x000e4;chsischer und b&#x000f6;hmischer Bandkeramik. In Th. Doppler, B. Ramminger, D. Schimmelpfennig (eds.) Grenzen und Grenzr&#x000e4;ume? Kerpen-Loogh: 11-24) or Southern Bavaria (Pechtl J [2010] Anmerkungen zum Kenntnisstand linienbandkeramischer Hausarchitektur im s&#x000fc;d&#x000f6;stlichen Bayern und zum Potenzial ihrer typologischen Auswertungen. Fines Transire 19: 35-51), and in our view such &#x0201e;jumps&#x0201c; are highly significant, but beyond the scope of the present paper.</p><p>It has been claimed again and again that the variation in orientation follows &#x0201e;local topography&#x0201c; (e. g., because of prevailing currents). However, where this suggestion was put to the test (Mattheu&#x000df;er E (1991) Die geographische Ausrichtung bandkeramischer H&#x000e4;user. In: Studien zur Siedlungsarch&#x000e4;ologie 1. Bonn: Habelt. pp. 1-49), it turned out to be not valid. Anyway, even if true, it would not explain variation per site. </p><p>We would be keen to hear of the &#x0201e;some sites [where] we can observe shifts in west-ward [= clockwise?] orientation which is a counterargument against gradual visual misconception.&#x0201c; We actually looked at a much larger number of sites than presented in the paper but only found the same tendency of counter-clockwise shifts. Bylany may be the only possible exception when it comes to major excavated sites. Unfortunately, the available data is presented in such a condensed manner (Pamatky archeologicke 77, 1986, 397 Table 49) that it is difficult to draw definite conclusions.</p><p>The point is, and this is clearly stated in text, that the pseudoneglect explanation only is relevant where there are no other reasons (topography, agglomeration of houses, circular arrangement of houses). There might also be other factors we have not accounted for, or that we archaeologically cannot account for. However, the evidence of counter-clockwise shifts is strong, and it is clearly not to be dismissed even if there were singular occurences of clockwise ones.</p><p>To account for the critique of reviewer 2, we added explaining sentences at the beginning, in the middle and at the end.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226082.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Mue-Schee_et_al_rebuttal.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226082.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0226082.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0226082.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Biehl</surname><given-names>Peter F.</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Peter F.
