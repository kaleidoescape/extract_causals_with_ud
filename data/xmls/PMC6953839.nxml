Chemoresistance-related molecules are correlated with poor prognosis and may be effective targets for cancer treatment. Here, we aimed to identify novel molecules correlated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. We established 10 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines from patients with pancreatic cancer and performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissues from PDXs after treatment with standard drugs. We established a gene-transferred tumor cell line to express chemoresistance-related molecules and analyzed the chemoresistance of the established cell line against standard drugs. Finally, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of chemoresistance-related molecules using 80 pancreatic cancer tissues. From NGS analysis, we identified olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4) as having high expression in the PDX group treated with anticancer drugs. In IHC analysis, OLFM4 expression was also high in PDXs administered anticancer drugs compared with that in untreated PDXs. Chemoresistance was observed by <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of tumor cell lines with forced expression of OLFM4. In an assessment of tissue specimens from 80 patients with pancreatic cancer, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients in the low OLFM4 expression group had a better survival rate than patients in the high OLFM4 expression group. Additionally, multivariate analysis showed that high expression of OLFM4 was an independent prognostic factor predicting poor outcomes. Overall, our study revealed that high expression of OLFM4 was involved in chemoresistance and was an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. OLFM4 may be a candidate therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Noile-Immune Biotech, Inc.

Thus, only approximately 20% of tumors are resectable at presentation [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and development of improved methods for early diagnosis is urgently needed. Another reason for the high mortality rates is resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite our broader understanding of pancreatic cancer biology, gemcitabine (GEM), which was approved for pancreatic cancer treatment approximately 20 years ago and fundamentally changed cancer treatment, remains the standard treatment for this aggressive cancer [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, no studies have supported the appropriate regimen for second-line chemotherapy. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are required. As a key drug used for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, GEM treatment can often lead to chemoresistance. Thus, in order to improve the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer, novel approaches are needed to overcome chemoresistance to GEM.</p><p>Many types of cancer cell lines have been used in research studies. However, because these cell lines are cultured under artificial conditions, they do not necessarily reflect the actual kinetics and phenotypes of cancer cells. Animal models are often used in preclinical studies for predicting the efficacy and possible toxicities of anticancer drugs in patients with cancer [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PDX models have attracted attention in recent years for assessment of the efficacy of anticancer drugs [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and for biomarker development and testing. Additionally, these models have been used to clarify the microenvironment and characteristics of cancer cells. In PDX models, cancer cells or small tumor tissues derived from patients are injected into immune-deficient mice and retain similar morphology, architecture, and molecular signatures as the original cancers; thus, these models could have applications in rapid screening of potential therapeutics. PDX models could preserve clinical information from the donor patient, enabling accelerated cancer research by simulating the human cancer microenvironment [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, we established PDXs for use in this this study.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to identify novel chemoresistance-related molecules in pancreatic cancer using pancreatic cancer PDXs. We then analyzed the role of olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4), which was identified as a chemoresistance-related protein, in chemoresistance in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model and evaluated the expression and prognostic ability of OLFM4 by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis in 80 pancreatic cancer tissues from human patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Establishment of pancreatic cancer PDXs</title><p>Immune-deficient NSG mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Sacramento, CA, USA).

Tumor tissues were fixed with 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissues were then sliced into 4-&#x003bc;m-thick sections and subjected to standard hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining or IHC analysis. After deparaffinization and washing in phosphate-buffered saline, endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated by treatment with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 min. Primary antibodies specific for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I -A, B, C (dilution 1:500; Hokudo, Sapporo, Japan) were applied and incubated for 60 min to demonstrate that tumor cells in PDXs were derived from patient tissues. Simple stain MAX-PO (M) (Nichirei Biosciences, Japan) was used as a secondary antibody and incubated with the samples for 1 h. After washing, cells were visualized by 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment.</p><p>In order to investigate the characteristics of gene mutations, we conducted DNA/RNA extraction and high-throughput sequencing. The tumor tissues were cut into small pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen as soon as possible after tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed. The frozen tissues were crushed using a Cryo-Press (Microtec, Funabashi, Chiba, Japan). Total DNA/RNA from crushed tissues was isolated and purified with a ZR-Duet DNA/RNA MiniPrep kit (ZYMO RESEARCH, Irvine, CA, USA). DNA/RNA quality was then assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). cDNA libraries were constructed using these RNAs, and libraries were subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform at BGI (Shenzhen, China).

Patients with pancreatic cancer were histopathologically diagnosed between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2017 at the same hospital. Patients with no previous history of chemotherapy (GEM monotherapy, GEM and nab-PTX combination therapy) were included. This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Showa University School of Medicine (Tokyo, Japan; approval no. 2611), and all study procedures adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Consent was not obtained from individual patients. However, patients were notified of the details of the study and were given the right to refuse study participation. Additionally, our study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Showa University School of Medicine (approval no. 2611) in accordance with Japanese ethical guidelines. All data were fully anonymized before being accessed.</p><p>We used archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues from resected specimens from patients who were histopathologically diagnosed for immunohistological analysis. Histological classifications were based on the World Health Organization system. Tumor staging was performed according to the criteria described in the UICC TNM classification (7<sup>th</sup> edition, 2009). The patients included in this study were diagnosed with stage IIA or stage IIB disease according to the 7<sup>th</sup> edition of UICC.</p><p>Immunohistological analysis was performed to evaluate OLFM4 protein expression in human pancreatic cancer tissues. FFPE tissue sections (3 &#x003bc;m thick) were analyzed using a Leica Bond system with standard protocols, as follows. Briefly, sections were pretreated using heat-mediated antigen retrieval with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6 for anti-OLFM4 antibodies) for 20 min. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies against OLFM4 (1:1000 dilution; cat. no. ab85046; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 15 min at room temperature and detected using a horse radish peroxidase-conjugated compact polymer system. DAB was used as the chromogen. Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, sections were viewed under a bright-field microscope.</p><p>The stained tissue sections were reviewed and scored separately by two pathologists who were blinded to the clinical parameters. The degree of immunostaining was based on the intensity of staining and percentage of cells stained. Staining intensity was graded according to the following criteria: 0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong (uncolored, light yellow, yellowish brown, and brown, respectively). Staining percentages were graded according to the proportion of positively stained tumor cells, as follows: 0 for less than 5% positive tumor cells; 1 for 5&#x02013;9% positive tumor cells; 2 for 10&#x02013;29% positive tumor cells; and 3 for greater than or equal to 30% positive tumor cells. Using this method of assessment, we evaluated OLFM4 expression based on the staining index (scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9). An optimal cut-off value was identified as follows: a staining index score of less than 2 was used to indicate low OLFM4 expression, and an index score of more than 3 was used to define tumors with high OLFM4 expression.</p><p>For analysis of clinicopathological factors, invasive factor was evaluated based on the classification of pancreatic cancer recommended by the Japan Pancreas Society for further stratification. Lymphatic invasion was graded according to the following criteria: ly0, negative; ly1, weak; ly2, moderate; and ly3, strong, according to the degree of invasion. Venous invasion was graded as v0, v1, v2, and v3 according to the same descriptions.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were analyzed for statistical significance using JMP Pro 14.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Associations between the IHC status of OLFM4 expression and various clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated using Student&#x02019;s t tests or Pearson chi-square tests. Classification and regression tree analysis was used to assess the optimal prognostic cut-off for OLFM4 expression in overall survival (OS). Kaplan Meier analysis and the log rank tests were applied to estimate differences in OS according to high and low OLFM4 expression. OS was defined as the interval in months between the initial pancreatic resection surgery and either death or the last observation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were based on the Cox proportional hazards regression model. All tests were two-sided, and results with <italic>p</italic> values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Establishment of a pancreatic cancer PDX model</title><p>We have generated many PDX models using patient tumor tissue to date [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

In order to verify whether these PDXs retained the characteristics of patient-derived tumors, histopathological analysis and gene analysis were performed using the original tumor tissues from patients and PDXs. Initially, the tumor tissues were stained with HE and analyzed by two pathologists. A comparison of the histopathological findings revealed that the histological features of patient specimens were retained, even when PDX passages were repeated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226707.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

Furthermore, immunohistological analysis showed that the expression of the HLA class I molecule on the tumor cells in PDX specimens was also retained, even after PDX passaging. HLA class I expression supported that tumor cells from PDXs were derived from patient tissues in terms of histological characteristics.

Therefore, it is important to identify novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Accordingly, in this study, we first established pancreatic cancer PDXs and identified OLFM4 as a chemoresistance-related molecule in PDXs treated with anticancer drugs. We performed NGS of tumor tissues from PDXs after treatment with standard chemotherapy. For both the GEM and GEM + nab-PTX administration group, few secondary gene mutations resulted from chemotherapy administration, as expected (data not shown). Moreover, all of these were passenger mutations, and no driver mutations were detected. Furthermore, no common gene mutations were found between chemotherapy groups. Accordingly, we concluded that although chemoresistance was not due to genetic mutations after chemotherapy administration, expression of OLFM4 mRNA was affected. In addition, in vitro experiments in OLFM4-expressing HeLa cells treated with GEM showed that OLFM4 expression was correlated with chemoresistance. Furthermore, we conducted cell viability assay for GEM-treated pancreatic cancer cell lines with both endogenous OLFM4 downregulation and upregulation. It was confirmed that OLFM4 expression had a role in chemoresistance via an vitro experiment using pancreatic cancer cell lines. In experiments using real human samples, we showed that high expression of OLFM4 was a critical independent prognostic factor and was associated with cancer survival in pancreatic cancer. Analysis of TCGA data also supported our results, highlighting OLFM4 expression as a prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. Overall, these data showed that OLFM4 was a chemoresistance-related molecule and that OLFM4 expression was correlated with prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Various mouse tumor models and tumor cell lines have been used to study cancer. However, the results of these studies do not necessarily reflect human clinical data [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], mainly because of the lack of a tumor microenvironment in such cell and tumor models. Moreover, studies in mice often are not directly applicable to human patients [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to establish animal models that better reflect human clinical pathology. Recently, the NCI retired their &#x0201c;NCI-60&#x0201d; panel of human tumor cell lines that had been used for more than 25 years as an anticancer drug-screening platform. Instead, they have refocused drug screening on newer models, including PDXs, which are generated by implanting small chunks of human tumors in mice to create an environment that better mimics the human body [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our group established 61 PDX lines from 116 surgically removed tumor tissues inoculated subcutaneously into NSG mice at the Kanagawa Cancer Center [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, PDX establishment success rate was 53% in our group. For pancreatic cancer, 10 PDX lines were established from 19 surgically removed pancreatic cancer tumor tissues, with a success rate of 52.6%. In this study, we established pancreatic cancer PDXs that preserved the pathological and genetic characteristics of human tumor tissues by transplanting patient-derived tumor specimens into super-immunodeficient mice. We confirmed that the PDXs retained most of the main histological and genetic characteristics of their donor tumors and remained stable after repeated passaging. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tumor cells of PDXs were derived from human patient tissues, not mice, by IHC analysis of the HLA class I molecule. Particularly for pancreatic cancer, it is often difficult to perform surgical resection and biopsy using endoscopic ultrasound/fine needle aspiration at the time of diagnosis; thus, the amount of sample tissue that can be collected is often limited. Therefore, PDX models are considered optimal animal models for research on pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Using these PDXs, we found that increased mRNA expression of <italic>OLFM4</italic> led to chemoresistance. However, variations in mRNA expression do not always correspond to changes in protein expression because protein expression can be influenced by various post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, mRNA measurement can be a poor predictor of protein abundance variations. Zhang et al. analyzed proteomics of colon and rectal tumors previously characterized in the TCGA database and showed that mRNA transcript abundance did not reliably predict protein abundance differences between tumors [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. That is, mRNA expression levels do not necessarily correlate with protein expression or disease progression [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Next, we performed IHC staining for OLFM4 protein using PDX models to confirm whether OLFM4 protein levels were similar to mRNA levels. OLFM4 protein expression was higher in anticancer drug-treated PDXs than in untreated PDXs. Thus, these findings confirmed that OLFM4 was strongly expressed in anticancer drug-treated PDXs at the protein and mRNA levels.</p><p>Although PDX models show pathological features similar to those of the original human tumor, these models still do not completely reflect human pathology. Therefore, we examined the expression of OLFM4 protein and the relationships between OLFM4 expression and clinicopathological factors using 80 pancreatic cancer tissues from human patients. Clinical stage greatly affected prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer; therefore, we focused on patients with stage IIA or IIB disease, which are the most frequently encountered patients as candidates for curative resection [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Currently, GEM monotherapy and GEM and nab-PTX combination therapy are not approved as neoadjuvant chemotherapies in Japan. Therefore, chemotherapy na&#x000ef;ve patients were eligible for this study. Importantly, high expression of OLFM4 was an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Several studies have investigated the role of OLFM4 in tumor differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Studies based on the differentiation state of gastric and cervical cancers have demonstrated that an increase in the expression of OLFM4 is correlated with tumor differentiation state. These studies, carried out using IHC analysis for OLFM4 expression, showed a marked increase in OLFM4 in well-differentiated tissues, whereas OLFM4 levels were significantly lower in poorly differentiated tissues [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226707.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study, OLFM4 expression did not differ depending on the degree of tumor differentiation. Therefore, OLFM4 expression may differ between pancreatic cancer and gastric or cervical cancer.</p><p>OLFM4 expression has been reported in several solid cancers and has been shown to be involved in prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, high OLFM4 expression has been shown to be related to both poor and good prognoses in different studies, and no consensus has been reached. For instance, Mayama et al. showed that OLFM4 independently predicted a poor prognosis for ER-positive breast cancer. On the other hand, some studies have suggested that OLFM4-positive gastric and colorectal cancer patients have better survival rates than OLFM4-negative patients [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226707.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226707.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, the correlation between OLFM4 expression and cancer prognosis is controversial and has not yet been confirmed. In this study, we demonstrated that high expression of OLFM4 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The contribution of OLFM4 to poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer may be related to the function of OLFM4. OLFM4 has been shown to participate in regulating cellular functions, such as cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the PANC-1 cell line, OLFM4 mRNA was shown to increase through the early S phase of the cell cycle, and to promote proliferation by supporting the S to G2/M phase transition [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, OLFM4 also interacts with cell surface proteins, such as cadherin and lectins, and is involved in cell adhesion and migration [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226707.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, OLFM4 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis-promoting factor GRIM-19 to induce anti-apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and anti-apoptotic effects in tumor cells exposed to stress-inducing factors, such as hydrogen peroxide, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, and cytotoxic agents [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These functions suggest that OLFM4 is involved in poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer and supported the results in our study.</p><p>In recent studies for patients, Yan et al. reported that OLFM4 was found to be significantly over-expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in pancreatic cancer patients, compared with a healthy control group [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. They concluded that OLFM4 expression in peripheral blood could be a promising tumor marker for early detection of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we performed IHC analysis of OLFM4 expression using 80 pancreatic cancer tissues, instead of peripheral blood samples. In addition, we demonstrated that expression of OLFM4 was predictive of chemoresistance and a poor prognostic biomarker.</p><p>In addition, Takadate et al. identified four proteins, including OLFM4, as candidate prognostic markers of postoperative pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using a mass spectrometry&#x02010;based proteomics approach with archived FFPE tissues. They found that high OLFM4 protein expression was correlated with significantly worse overall survival [<xref rid="pone.0226707.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although our study supported this result, the process for identifying candidate molecules that may have a poor prognosis was different. Using NGS, we found that the expression of <italic>OLFM4</italic> mRNA was upregulated after administration of anticancer drugs. Additionally, tumor cells expressing OLFM4 are resistant to anticancer drugs <italic>in vitro</italic> and may show variations in sensitivity to chemotherapy. Thus, it is possible that such cells expressing OLFM4 may persist after anticancer drug treatment, contributing to the observed poor prognosis. We demonstrated the role of OLFM4 in chemoresistance, which has not been described in previous studies. Thus, to determine the relationship between OLFM4 expression and chemoresistance, further cellular and molecular biological investigations are required. However, overall our findings indicate that OLFM4 may be a promising new prognostic marker and therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226707.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Sources of tumor tissues from patients with pancreatic cancer.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226707.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226707.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Establishment of patient-derived xenografts.</title><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226707.s002.pptx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226707.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Verification of antitumor effects in PDX tumors.</title><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226707.s003.pptx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226707.s004"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Histopathological analysis of primary tumors and PDX tumors.</title><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226707.s004.pptx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226707.s005"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and immunoblotting.</title><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226707.s005.pptx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226707.s006"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Material &#x00026; methods for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0226707.s005">S4 Fig</xref>.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226707.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study is supported by research funds from Noile-Immune Biotech Inc.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0226707.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cancer statistics, 2018</article-title>. <source>CA Cancer J Clin</source>. <year>2018</year>;<volume>68</volume>: <fpage>7</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>30</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3322/caac.21442</pub-id>

</p><p>PONE-D-19-18437</p><p>High expression of olfactomedin-4 is correlated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Prof. Wada,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>It looks that your manuscript was of little interest to the scientific community, because 27 scholars, including Dr. Gulley, declined or were reluctant to evaluate your report, except Reviewer 1.&#x000a0; Therefore, this academic editor evaluated your report by himself as another Reviewer.</p><p>You need to address the following issues:</p><p>(1) Next-generation sequencing (NGS).&#x000a0; You need to carry out whole-exome sequencing and analyze genetic alterations to investigate the mechanisms of chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer patients.</p><p>(2) OLFM4 overexpression experiments in HeLa cells.&#x000a0; You should describe how you established HeLa cells overexpressing OLFM4. &#x000a0;</p><p>(3) OLFM4 overexpression and knockdown experiments in pancreatic cancer cells.&#x000a0; You need to investigate OLFM4 expression levels in pancreatic cancer cell lines, and then carry out OLFM4 overexpression experiments in pancreatic cancer cell lines with endogenous OLFM4 downregulation, and also OLFM4 knockdown experiments in pancreatic cancer cell lines with endogenous OLFM4 upregulation.</p><p>(4) Pancreatic cancer PDXs.&#x000a0; You are advised to describe success rate of PDX establishment in your group.</p><p>(5) Histochemical analyses.&#x000a0; You showed histochemical analysis of primary tumor and PDXs in one case.&#x000a0; You need to show results for other cases in a supplementary Figure.</p><p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Nov 17 2019 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p><p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p><p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Masaru Katoh, M.D., Ph.D.</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p><bold>Journal Requirements:</bold></p><p>1.

The study is interesting and the manuscript is well-written. My only concern is that the discussion is mostly covered by the repetition of the results and should be improved. The authors should explain the similarities and differences between the current study and published literature.</p><p>-Wang XY, et al.

You need to carry out whole-exome sequencing and analyze genetic alterations to investigate the mechanisms of chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer patients.</p><p>Answer: </p><p>We sincerely appreciate your comment.</p><p>We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissues from PDXs before and after treatment with standard chemotherapy. Regarding Figure 2, in the Gemcitabine administration group, the number of gene mutations (missense mutations) after chemotherapy administration compared to before treatment was 1 (PDX #1), 1 (#3), 1 (#4), 11 (#5), 2 (#7) and 2 (#9). For the Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel administration group, the number of gene mutations after chemotherapy administration was 4 (#1), 7 (#2), 1 (#3), 0 (#4), 2 (#5), 1 (#6), 1 (#7), 6 (#8), 1 (#9), and 0 (#10). Therefore, the number of secondary gene mutations was less than expected due to the administration of anticancer drugs. All secondary gene mutations were of the passenger type, and no driver mutations were detected. Furthermore, no common gene mutations were found between chemotherapy groups. From the above, we concluded that although chemoresistance was not due to genetic mutations after chemotherapy administration, OLFM4 mRNA expression was affected. We appreciate your helpful comment, and have added an explanation to the discussion section (P27-28, lines 452-457).</p><p>(2) OLFM4 overexpression experiments in HeLa cells. You should describe how you established HeLa cells overexpressing OLFM4. </p><p>Answer:</p><p>Thank you for your helpful comment. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid containing DNA of interest using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Progema, Madison, WI, USA), following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. For the OLFM4 transfection assay, HeLa cells were seeded in a 6-well Falcon plate. After 24 hours, cells were transfected with pCMV6-Ac-OLFM4-GFP tag plasmids (NM_006418, OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) and an empty vector as a control, according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. As indicated, we have included an explanation for how to establish HeLa cells overexpressing OLFM4 in the Material and Methods section (P13, lines 204-211).</p><p>(3) OLFM4 overexpression and knockdown experiments in pancreatic cancer cells. You need to investigate OLFM4 expression levels in pancreatic cancer cell lines, and then carry out OLFM4 overexpression experiments in pancreatic cancer cell lines with endogenous OLFM4 downregulation, and also OLFM4 knockdown experiments in pancreatic cancer cell lines with endogenous OLFM4 upregulation.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>&#x03000;We sincerely appreciate your comment. According to your helpful comment, we carried out the additional experiments for using pancreatic cancer cell lines.</p><p>We investigated the assay of OLFM4 expression levels in pancreatic cancer cell lines, such as PANC-1, KP2, MIA PaCa-2 and SUIT-2 cell line. In addition, we demonstrated the cell viability assay for Gemcitabine addition in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell line with endogenous OLFM4 downregulation, and in KP2 and SUIT-2 cell line with endogenous OLFM4 upregulation.</p><p>PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were transfected pCMV-6-OLFM4-GFP and an empty vector, then it was confirmed OLFM4 overexpressed in only MIA PaCa-2 cells. Then we performed the cell viability assay for MIA PaCa-2 cells, the OLFM4 overexpressing cells were more remained than the control cells after adding Gemcitabine. Additionally, KP2 and SUIT-2 cells were transfected siRNA targeting OLFM4. The OLFM4 expression was knockdown in SUIT-2 cell lines, but OLFM4 knockdown was not observed in KP2 cell lines. We performed the cell viability assay for SUIT-2 cells, the OLFM4 knockdown cells were less viable than the control cells after adding Gemcitabine. From these results, we demonstrated the chemoresistant role for OLFM4 expression even in pancreatic cancer cell lines both with endogenous OLFM4 downregulation and upregulation.</p><p>As indicated, we have changed the Figure 7b-d (Fig 7) and the Figure Legends (P23, lines 393-399). We have included an explanation for the additional experiment in the section of Material and Methods (P12-14, lines 193-221) and Results (P22-23, lines 377-391). Supplementary Figure 4 (S4 Fig) was newly created to explain the results of the additional experiments. And based on the results of additional experiments, we have modified the part of Discussion section (P28, lines 459-462).</p><p>(4) Pancreatic cancer PDXs. You are advised to describe success rate of PDX establishment in your group.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>Thank you for your helpful comment. We established 61 PDX lines from 116 surgically removed tumor tissues inoculated subcutaneously into NSG mice at the Kanagawa Cancer Center [Chijiwa T, et al. Int J Oncol. 2015;47: 61-70]. The success rate was 53%. Regarding PDX for pancreatic cancer, 10 PDX lines were established from 19 surgically removed pancreatic cancer tumor tissues, and the success rate was 52.6%. As indicated, we have added an explanation for the PDX establishment success rate in the Discussion section (P29, lines 477-482).</p><p>(5) Histochemical analyses. You showed histochemical analysis of primary tumor and PDXs in one case. You need to show results for other cases in a supplementary Figure.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>&#x03000;Thank you for your helpful comment. Since HE staining was performed in all cases, we presented them as a supplementary Figure 3 (S3 Fig). In nine cases other than Figure 1a, the histopathological characteristics of the patient tumor tissues matched that of PDX models. We appreciate your helpful comment, and have added an explanation to the section of Results (P17, lines 291-292).</p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>Ohkuma and colleagues reported that high expression of OLFM4 was involved in chemoresistance and was an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. The study is interesting and the manuscript is well-written. My only concern is that the discussion is mostly covered by the repetition of the results and should be improved. The authors should explain the similarities and differences between the current study and published literature.</p><p>-Wang XY, et al. World J Gastroenterol. 2018;24(17):1881-1887.</p><p>-Guette C, et al. Proteomics Clin Appl. 2015;9(1-2):58-63.</p><p>-Yan H, et al. Hepatogastroenterology. 2011;58(109):1354-9. </p><p>Answer:</p><p>We sincerely appreciate your helpful comment. We partially modified the discussion section to explain the similarities and differences between recent studies and our study.</p><p>&#x03000; Several studies have investigated the role of OLFM4 in tumor differentiation [Guette C, et al. Proteomics Clin Appl. 2015;9(1-2):58-6]. Increased expression of OLFM4 has been found to correlate with tumor differentiation state in gastric and cervical cancers, as determined through IHC analysis. In our study, the expression of OLFM4 did not differ according to degree of tumor differentiation.</p><p>&#x03000;OLFM4 expression has been reported in several solid cancers and has been shown to be predictive of prognosis. One study found that OLFM4 independently predicted a poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer [Mayama et al. Cancer Sci. 2018;109: 3350-3359]. On the other hand, OLFM4 is correlated with a better prognosis in gastric and colorectal cancers [Wang XY, et al. World J Gastroenterol. 2018;24(17):1881-1887]. Therefore, the correlation between OLFM4 expression and cancer prognosis is controversial and has not yet been confirmed. In our study, we demonstrated that high expression of OLFM4 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer through IHC analysis.</p><p>&#x03000;Yan H et al. demonstrated that OLFM4 was significantly over-expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in pancreatic cancer patients, compared with a healthy control group [Yan H, et al. Hepatogastroenterology. 2011;58(109):1354-9]. In this study, we performed IHC analysis of OLFM4 expression using 80 pancreatic cancer tissues instead of peripheral blood samples. We then demonstrated a correlation between expression of OLFM4 and chemoresistance/poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>&#x03000;We really appreciate this helpful comment. As indicated, we have modified the Discussion section (P31-33, lines 517-534, 537-539, 542-552, 562-567).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226707.s007"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers_2.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226707.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0226707.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0226707.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Katoh</surname><given-names>Masaru</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Masaru Katoh</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Masaru Katoh</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0226707" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
