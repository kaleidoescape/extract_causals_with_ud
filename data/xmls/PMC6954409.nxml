Here we demonstrate that MEF2D is the key factor controlling <italic>HDAC9</italic> transcription. This control, which is part of a negative feed-back loop during muscle differentiation, is hijacked in cancer. In leiomyosarcomas the MEF2D/HDAC9 vicious circuit sustains proliferation and cell survival, through the repression of the death receptor FAS. Comprehensive genome-wide studies demonstrate that HDAC4 and HDAC9 control different genetic programs and show both specific and common genomic binding sites. Although the number of MEF2-target genes commonly regulated is similar, only HDAC4 represses many additional genes that are not MEF2D targets. As expected, <italic>HDAC4<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>HDAC9<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells increase H3K27ac levels around the TSS of the respective repressed genes. However, these genes rarely show binding of the HDACs at their promoters. Frequently HDAC4 and HDAC9 bind intergenic regions. We demonstrate that these regions, recognized by MEF2D/HDAC4/HDAC9 repressive complexes, show the features of active enhancers. In these regions HDAC4 and HDAC9 can differentially influence H3K27 acetylation. Our studies describe new layers of class IIa HDACs regulation, including a dominant positional effect, and can contribute to explain the pleiotropic actions of MEF2 TFs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100005010</named-content></funding-source><award-id>IG 15640</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">POR-FESR regione Friuli-Venezia Giulia ATeNA</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Sarcoma Foundation of America</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100003341</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Class IIa HDACs are important regulators of different adaptive and differentiative responses. During embryonic development, these deacetylases influence specific differentiation pathways and tissue morphogenesis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>). In vertebrates HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 and HDAC9 constitute the class IIa subfamily. Because of the Tyr/His substitution in the catalytic site, they exhibit a negligible lysine-deacetylase activity (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, the deacetylase domain, through the recruitment of the NCOR1/NCOR2/HDAC3 complex, can influence histones modifications, including acetylation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>). The repressive influence of class IIa HDACs can also be exploited independently from HDAC3 recruitment. In fact MITR, a HDAC9 splicing variant, can still repress transcription in the absence of the deacetylase domain (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The amino-terminus of class IIa HDACs is dedicated to the binding of different transcription factors (TFs), among which MEF2 family members are the foremost characterized (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Overall, class IIa HDACs genomic activities require their assembly into multiprotein complexes where they operate as platforms coordinating the activity of TFs, as well as of other epigenetic regulators (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>These deacetylases are subjected to multiple levels of regulation. The phosphorylation-dependent control of the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling has been the most commonly investigated (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Curiously, although the lineage-dependent expression is a main feature of class IIa, signalling pathways and mechanisms controlling their transcription are largely unknown (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). An exception is the muscle tissue. Here HDAC9 transcription is under the direct control of MEF2D. In this manner, the MEF2D-HDAC9 axis sustains a negative-feedback loop in the transcriptional circuit of muscle differentiation to buffer MEF2D activities (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Importantly, in specific cancer types, this circuit seems to be misused. In pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia MEF2D oncogenic fusions dramatically upregulate HDAC9 expression (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Abrogation of the MEF2D-HDAC9 negative circuit was also observed in highly aggressive malignant rhabdoid tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma and leiomyosarcoma (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Since the pro-oncogenic roles of class IIa HDAC have been proved by different studies, understanding the reasons and the importance of such abrogation is of primary interest in cancer research (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;18</xref>).</p><p>In this manuscript, we have investigated the MEF2-HDAC axis in cellular models of leiomyosarcoma (LMS). LMS are rare highly malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin, with cells presenting features of the smooth muscle lineage (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We have demonstrated that the MEF2D-HDAC9 axis plays a key role in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype and deciphered the genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic landscapes under the control of class IIa HDACs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell cultures and cytofluorimetric analysis</title><p>Leiomyosarcomas cells (LMS), SK-UT-1, SK-LMS-1, MES-SA and DMR were grown as previously described (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

The mechanisms responsible for this up-regulation are not defined. The TCGA data analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) shows that in LMS patients the co-overexpression of one class IIa HDAC and one MEF2 TF is frequent. In fact, a significant co-occurrence of MEF2D and HDAC9 overexpression (<italic>P</italic>-value 0.035, log odds ratio 1427) and a trend of co-occurrence for MEF2A and HDAC5 mark these patients. ENCODE data evidence the presence of MEF2 binding sites, which are conserved through evolution, in the proximal promoter of HDAC9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We proved that MEF2D up-regulates the transcription from the HDAC9 promoter in different cell lines including LMS cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). SK-UT-1 cells faithfully reflect LMS in terms of MEF2D and HDAC9 de-regulation. Both proteins are highly up-regulated in these aggressive cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).

Furthermore, within the HDAC4-repressed genes, MEF2A influence is more pronounced compared to MEF2D. This observation was confirmed by GSEA (Genes Set Enrichment Analysis).

In particular, 56% of these events are in common with HDAC4 and HDAC9, 43% are MEF2D/HDAC4 specific and only 1.2% are MEF2D/HDAC9 specific. HDAC4 displays a substantial MEF2D-independent activity as 82% of its peaks are bound neither by MEF2D nor by HDAC9. On the contrary, HDAC9 specific peaks are less frequent (20%). DNA motif analysis on the HDAC4-specific peaks showed an enrichment for SMAD3 and CENPB binding motifs.

Interestingly, MEF2D peaks localization undergoes significant changes when associated with common binding of HDAC4/HDAC9. In these cases 64% occur in intergenic, 14% in introns and only 18% in promoter regions. This re-localization seems to only partially depend on the presence of HDAC4 alone, since MEF2D/HDAC4 common mapping is 47% intergenic, 29% intronic and 17% in promoter regions. To further evaluate the chromatin status around these peaks, we mapped the H3K27 acetylation either as a perfect overlap (min. 1&#x000a0;bp in common) or in a 2&#x000a0;kb interval from the peak summit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Overall, the presence of HDAC4 frequently correlates with an open chromatin status, while HDAC9 peaks are commonly confined in regions marked by poor H3K27 acetylation. These correlations are MEF2-independent. In general, the co-presence of MEF2D increases H3K27 acetylation incidence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><p>It is plausible that the genomic binding sites of the two class IIa HDACs and possibly of MEF2D, within the regulative elements of the genes up-regulated after the KO of HDAC4 and HDAC9, may influence their epigenetic status and subsequently the transcriptional output.

How these alterations influence the epigenetic plasticity of cancer cells is still unknown. In this manuscript we have investigated the altered expression and dissected the functions of class IIa HDACs in LMS. These tumors are considered <italic>genetically complex</italic> soft tissue sarcomas, with a high mutational burden and a complex karyotype with several losses, gains and amplifications (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Alterations in the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway, deletions of the tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 and mutations in ATRX and MED12 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) are frequent in LMS. Up-regulation of miR-143 and miR-145 and low expression of inflammatory response genes are also common in LMS (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Approximately 30% of LMS express high levels of a class IIa HDACs, and of HDAC9 in particular (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated that the increased expression of HDAC9 stems from an alteration of the MEF2-HDAC feed-back loop. Silencing of MEF2D causes a parallel downregulation of HDAC9 levels and it is coupled to the appearance of a repressive epigenetic state at its promoter. Furthermore, the CRISPR-mediated deletion of the MEF2D binding sites in the HDAC9 promoter switches off HDAC9 transcription and perfectly recapitulates the proliferative defects of SK-UT-1 cells knocked out for HDAC9.</p><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies find substantiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. In LMS patients the high levels of HDAC9 are significantly correlated with high levels of MEF2D expression. A similar alteration in the MEF2-class IIa HDACs loop could be responsible for the overexpression of HDAC5. In this case MEF2A seems to be involved. Dysfunctions of the MEF2D-HDAC9 circuit might be common to other tumor types (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). For example in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, characterized by MEF2D translocations, HDAC9 is frequently up-regulated (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>).</p><p>Three important questions still deserve specific answers: i) which is the mechanism that up-regulates MEF2D expression in LMS? ii) why does not the MEF2D-HDAC9 complex repress HDAC9 transcription, by binding the HDAC9 promoter? iii) why is the relationship between MEF2D and HDAC9 so exclusive? Does HDAC9 play a different epigenetic role with respect to the other class IIa HDACs?</p><p>We do not have an answer to the first question. However, by defining the genomic binding sites for MEF2D, HDAC4 and HDAC9 we provide some cues to the others points.</p><p>Class IIa HDACs have been described as tissue specific deacetylases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Certain phenotypes, observed after members specific knock-outs in mice or ablation in human cells, have been explained as the consequence of their lineage-dependent expression (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51&#x02013;54</xref>). Our study demonstrates that further levels of complexity do exist. The first level concerns the genomic bindings. HDAC4 and HDAC9 share several genomic binding sites but HDAC4, in particular, binds many additional regions, which possibly escape a HDAC9-dependent regulation.</p><p>The second level of complexity concerns MEF2D. This important class IIa HDACs partner can assemble onto specific genomic regions both the HDAC4 and the HDAC9 repressive complexes, while in other regions only a specific repressive complex is recruited, most frequently containing HDAC4 rather than HDAC9. Through the selective recruitment of a specific HDAC or a combination of more HDACs, MEF2 can monitor different patterns of gene expression, as verified by the transcriptomic analysis and proved by the different genetic programs under the control of the two HDACs examined. Within this level of complexity also the MITR isoform can be included. In fact, although MITR has been described as a transcriptional repressor, it contains16 aa of unknown function at the carboxy-terminus that differ from the HDAC9 canonical isoform (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Perhaps this complex, when assembled on the HDAC9 promoter, could impair the manifestation of a full repressive state.</p><p>A third level of complexity is obtained by a locus-dependent influence of a specific class IIa HDAC. In fact, even though a region is characterized by the co-presence of MEF2D/HDAC4/HDAC9 complexes, frequently only a family member plays an active role in the epigenetic regulation. We define this phenomenon as the <italic>dominant positional effect</italic> of a specific class IIa HDAC. An example is the intergenic region distal from the <italic>AHRGEF28</italic> locus. This region shows features of an enhancer and through chromatin looping could regulate the expression of <italic>ENC1</italic>. Although both HDAC4 and HDAC9 bind this region, only the knock-out of HDAC9 increases H3K27ac levels at the enhancer and promoter sites thus augmenting <italic>ENC1</italic> expression.</p><p>In general, the paucity of promoter regions bound by HDAC9 suggests that this HDAC is recruited by MEF2D or by alternative TFs to repress gene expression principally from distal regulative elements showing features of enhancers.</p><p>Another important difference marks HDAC9 with respect to HDAC4. HDAC9 very rarely binds the genome in open chromatin regions, as defined by H3K27ac. This data indicates that HDAC9 typifies stably repressed chromatin domains while HDAC4 influences more dynamic genomic regions, or could suggest that HDAC4 acts as the priming pioneering repressive factor for HDAC9.</p><p>Finally, a further layer of regulation is represented by MEF2D complexes that are not recognized by both HDAC4 and HDAC9. Although a contribution of HDAC5 should be taken into account, the demonstration that MEF2A and MEF2D can still sustain transcription on specific loci discourages the HDAC5 hypothesis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). On these loci, MEF2D acts positively by promoting the transcription of the associated genes. This evidence demonstrates that MEF2D has the capability to selectively escape the surveillance of class IIa HDACs on some well-defined genomic regions.</p><p>Despite the less numerous genomic binding sites and reduced number of genes under its influence, HDAC9 shows a strong impact on LMS cells proliferation. Cells deprived of HDAC9 show a higher apoptotic index that limits their prolonged maintenance in tissue culture. In this respect, we speculate that a certain degree of transcriptional heterogeneity, observed among the different <italic>HDAC9<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> clones, could reflect adaptive mechanisms that cells engage to survive the strong apoptotic pressure.</p><p>FAS up-regulation and the activation of the extrinsic pathway are responsible for the increased apoptotic pressure. Cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL12 and IFN&#x003b3; can sustain <italic>FAS</italic> transcription through the engagement of NF-kB, SP1, STAT1 and IRF8 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56&#x02013;60</xref>). Also TP53 family members are involved in FAS transcription (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>).</p><p>We could not find HDAC9 and MEF2D binding sites at the promoter region of FAS. However H3K27ac was increased after the deletion of HDAC9, both at the promoter and at a distal site within the subTAD. This distal region can undergo looping with the FAS promoter.</p><p>How HDAC9 could influence H3K27 acetylation at the FAS/ACTA2 locus is mysterious. It could operate through a distal enhancers or indirectly by controlling the expression of specific TFs. In fact, approx. 10% of the genes repressed by HDAC9 encode for TFs or epigenetic regulators and among them SMAD3 has been demonstrated to up-regulate FAS transcription (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Although FAS is a key element of the increased apoptotic response in HDAC9 deficient SK-UT-1 cells, MEF2 are pleiotropic TFs and in other contexts their pro-survival activities can be mediated by the regulation of different pro-survival or pro-death genes (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64&#x02013;66</xref>).</p><p>The impact of HDAC9 on LMS cells proliferation/survival is not limited to SK-UT-1 cells. DMR cells similarly overexpress HDAC9 and HDAC9 downregulation up-regulates FAS levels and triggers apoptosis in DMR cells too. We are confident that the repressive influence of HDAC9 on <italic>FAS</italic> transcription is a critical event for LMS survival/aggressiveness, as proved by the anti-correlation observed in tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="SEC5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>LMS are aggressive cancers, local recurrence and metastasis develop in approximately 40% of cases, which drastically reduce survival (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47&#x02013;49</xref>). Under these conditions available therapies are largely ineffective and the identification of new therapeutic targets is mandatory. Our studies point to class IIa HDACs and HDAC9 in particular as interesting targets to revitalize the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, the simultaneous up-regulation of chemokines, cytokines and secreted factors, exemplified by CXCL1, IL8, THBS1 and CYR61, after HDAC9 depletion, can sustain FAS-induced apoptosis and the action of the immune system for a better elimination of the neoplastic cells (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67&#x02013;69</xref>). This represent a strong incitement to evaluate HDAC9 inhibitors as possible onco-immunological drugs. Finally, we are confident that our deep investigation and description of the genomic preferences of MEF2D-HDAC4-HDAC9 complexes can fit to other models and help researchers in finding a genetic and epigenetic explanation to the pleiotropic actions of MEF2 TFs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC6"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The transcriptomic raw data are available as GEO accession GSE132569: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc</ext-link> = GSE132569.</p><p>Raw data corresponding to ChIP-seq experiments are uploaded with GEO accession GSE132622: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc</ext-link> = GSE132622.</p><p>The link to a UCSC genome browser session displaying the uploaded sequence tracks is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/DameBioinfo/DiGiorgio_et_al">http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/DameBioinfo/DiGiorgio_et_al</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1120_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="gkz1120_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Michele Gentile for the help in some experiments and Dr Ed Seto for providing HDAC9 cDNA.
