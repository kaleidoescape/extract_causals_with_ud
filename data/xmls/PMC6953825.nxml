In order to study the biological function of these proteases and to chemically validate some of them as viable drug targets, highly specific inhibitors need to be developed. This is especially challenging given the large number of clan CA proteases present in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species (ten in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>), and the difficulty of designing selective inhibitors that do not cross-react with other members of the same family. Additionally, any efforts to develop antimalarial drugs targeting these proteases will also have to take into account potential off-target effects against the 11 human cysteine cathepsins. Activity-based protein profiling has been a very useful tool to determine the specificity of inhibitors against all members of an enzyme family. However, current clan CA proteases broad-spectrum activity-based probes either target endopeptidases or dipeptidyl aminopeptidases, but not both subfamilies efficiently. In this study, we present a new series of dipeptydic vinyl sulfone probes containing a free N-terminal tryptophan and a fluorophore at the P1 position that are able to label both subfamilies efficiently, both in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and in mammalian cells, thus making them better broad-spectrum activity-based probes. We also show that some of these probes are cell permeable and can therefore be used to determine the specificity of inhibitors in living cells. Interestingly, we show that the choice of fluorophore greatly influences the specificity of the probes as well as their cell permeability.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship 099950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1852-4828</contrib-id><name><surname>Deu</surname><given-names>Edgar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Royal Society (UK)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship 099950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1852-4828</contrib-id><name><surname>Deu</surname><given-names>Edgar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie CIG PCIG14-GA-2013-631806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1852-4828</contrib-id><name><surname>Deu</surname><given-names>Edgar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia</institution></funding-source><award-id>GNT1091636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6810-6149</contrib-id><name><surname>Edgington-Mitchell</surname><given-names>Laura E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Russell and Mab Grimwade Miegunyah Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>Grimwade Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6810-6149</contrib-id><name><surname>Edgington-Mitchell</surname><given-names>Laura E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Welcome Trust and Royal Society Sir Henry Dale Fellowship 099950 and the Marie Curie Career Integration Grant PCIG14-GA-2013-631809, both awarded to E.D.

Malaria incidence has significantly decreased over the last 15 years mainly due to the distribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets and the use of artemisinin combination therapy as the standard of care for uncomplicated malaria[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, artemisinin resistance is on the rise[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and mosquitoes are becoming increasingly resistant to insecticides[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need to identify and validate new therapeutic targets[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Proteases have been pursued as drug targets for a variety of diseases by the pharmaceutical industry due to our structural understanding of their catalytic mechanism and specificity. Indeed, protease inhibitors are currently used to treat hypertension, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, or hepatitis C[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, clan CA proteases have gained interest as potential drug targets due to their prominent role in inflammation and cancer[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several pharmaceutical companies are currently undertaking drug development programs to treat chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis or bronchiectasis with cathepsin K[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and cathepsin C (CatC) inhibitors[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], respectively. Clan CA protease inhibitors are also being pursued as drugs to treat parasitic diseases such as Chagas disease[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, this family of proteases has been shown to be involved in essential biological process throughout the parasite life cycle[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This family is composed of 10 members in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and includes 3 dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) and 7 endopeptidases: 4 falcipains (FPs) and 3 SERAs (serine repeat antigens). In order to better understand the biological functions of these proteases and to chemically evaluate their potential as antimalarial targets, highly specific inhibitors are required. However, given the large number of clan CA proteases present in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, off-target effects within this family is one of the main hurdles to developing specific compounds. In addition, eleven cysteine cathepsins are expressed in humans. Therefore, highly specific inhibitors that do not target host proteases are needed to study the biological function of malarial proteases within the host context, either in animal models of malaria or during liver stages.</p><p>Activity-based probes (ABPs) are small molecules that use the enzymatic mechanism of an enzyme to covalently modify its active site[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A tag embedded within the structure of the probe, usually a biotin or fluorophore, allows for visualization of the labelled enzymes in a gel-based format. Biotinylated probes can also be used to pull-down the labelled proteins for MS identification. Broad-spectrum ABPs are designed to covalently modify all members of an enzyme family, thus allowing profiling of the activity of each member in a biological sample. This method known as activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) has been broadly applied to determine the specificity of inhibitors given that binding to the active site will prevent probe labelling. Although several ABPs have been developed for clan CA proteases, these probes generally either target endopeptidases or DPAPs, but not both subfamilies. For example, DCG04, which was developed based on the structure of the general covalent cysteine protease inhibitor E64[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], labels most mammalian cysteine cathepsins and the parasite FPs very efficiently, but is very inefficient at labelling <italic>Plasmodium</italic> DPAPs or CatC[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the other hand, the DPAP selective probe, FY01, does not label all endopeptidases efficiently[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, to profile the specificity of inhibitors against all clan CA proteases two probes are usually required. In this study, we report a new series of broad-spectrum ABPs that is able to label both of these subfamilies.</p><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> clan CA proteases play important roles throughout the parasite life cycle. Malaria is transmitted through the bite of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Parasites initially establish an asymptomatic infection in the liver where they multiply into thousands of merozoites (extracellular form that is able to infect erythrocytes). Release of parasites from infected hepatocytes into the blood stream initiates the erythrocytic cycle, which consists of red bood cell (RBC) invasion, parasite growth (ring to trophozoite stage transition), nuclear division and parasite replication (schizogony), and egress from the infected RBC (iRBC). This exponential asexual replication is responsible for the symptoms and pathology of malaria. A fraction of parasites develop into male and female gametocytes, which, after being ingested during a blood meal, will mature into gametes and sexually reproduce in the mosquito midgut. Parasites will then multiply and travel to the salivary glands from where they will be transmitted to the next human host.</p><p>Three subfamilies of clan CA proteases are conserved in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. In <italic>P</italic>. falciparum the SERA subfamily is composed of 9 members, each containing a papain-like domain, but only 3 have a catalytic cysteine (SERA6-8)[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The others have a serine instead and are predicted to be inactive. These proteases are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) as zymogens. The PV is a membrane bound vacuole within which parasites develop and replicate isolated from the host cytosol. SERAs are proteolytically activated by a subtilisin-like protease that is released into the PV 15 min before egress, and therefore are predicted to be active for a very short period of time[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. SERA6 has been shown to be essential for parasite egress from iRBCs, and this function is dependent on its catalytic cysteine[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Finally, the homologue of SERA8 in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> has been shown to be essential for parasite egress in insect stages[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>FPs are endopeptidases active at acidic pH and are expressed during the erythrocytic cycle[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. FP2a, FP2b, and FP3 localize to the digestive vacuole and are at the top of the proteolytic pathway responsible for haemoglobin degradation[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This pathway provides a source of amino acids for protein synthesis and liberates space within the iRBC to allow parasite growth. Because FP2a, FP2b, and FP3 perform redundant functions, their individual knockout (KO) does not result in parasite death[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

DPAPs are homologues of CatC and cleave dipeptides off the N-terminus of substrates. Compared to other clan CA proteases, DPAPs have an additional domain, known as the exclusion domain, that interacts with the free N-terminal amine of substrates via its N-terminal Asp side chain. This exclusion domain also prevents binding beyond the P2 position, thus preventing endopeptidase activity. DPAP1 is expressed at all stages of parasite development and has been proposed to play a role during the latest stages of the haemoglobin degradation pathway[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Although W-Cy5-VS also has broad specificity, it is a much weaker probe than W-sCy5-VS. Surprisingly, the probes containing the Cy3 and sCy3 fluorophores show very poor labelling of cysteine proteases under these conditions. These results illustrate how the choice of fluorophore can have a major influence on the potency and specificity of probes.</p><p>As reported previously, the W-hPG-VS inhibitor is a specific inhibitor of DPAP3[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but conjugating a fluorophore to the P1 position via cupper-catalyzed click chemistry results in a very significant loss of specificity, especially with sCy5. This was surprising as the P1 position is generally solvent exposed in clan CA proteases. However, substrate specificity studies on DPAPs have shown that long and hydrophobic non-natural amino acids at the P1 position greatly increase substrate turnover, possibly allowing the P1 residue to interact with an adjacent hydrophobic pocket[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This might also be the case for the FPs and might explain why our probes are no longer specific for DPAP3 when compared to W-hPG-VS. Another potential explanation is that the fluorophore might allow the probe to make non-specific hydrophobic interactions, increasing the time available for the catalytic cysteine to attack the vinyl sulfone warhead.

We used these labelling conditions because DPAPs and FPs are active and abundant at this stage, and because the RBC and PV membranes are still intact, thus allowing us to determine the cell-permeability of our probes. For all probes, clear labelling of cysteine proteases only occurs at 1 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227341.g003">Fig 3</xref>). It is also quite clear that the sulfate groups in W-sCy3-VS and W-sCy5-VS prevent the probes from crossing membranes and reaching their targets. Under these conditions, DCG04 only labels the FPs, and FY01 the DPAPs. However, W-Cy5-VS is able to label all of these proteases, thus making it a very useful broad-spectrum ABP that can be used in live parasites. Note that only the p120 form of DPAP3 is labelled in live parasites.

Briefly, schizont lysates were treated with DMSO or W-BF-VS under acidic conditions, the modified proteins were then pulled-down with streptavidin agarose beads and after multiple stringent washes, trypsin was added to the beads. This was performed in triplicate, and the tryptic peptides from each sample labelled with a different tandem mass tag (TMT). TMT-labelled peptides were pooled and fractionated into 8 samples by high pH reversed-phase fractionation. Peptides in each fraction were detected and quantified by LCMS/MS/MS analysis.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0227341.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the 10 most enriched proteins (<xref rid="pone.0227341.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227341.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) when comparing probe vs DMSO treatment. Among these, we could identify FP2, FP3 and both DPAPs, but not FP1. Note that FP2a and FP2b only differ in a single amino acid, therefore, the peptides identified for these proteins could not be assigned to either one of them. Interestingly, among the most enriched proteins we also identified several enzymes involved in redox catalysis such as thioredoxin or a disulphide isomerase, which are known to contain highly reactive catalytic cysteines. These might react with the vinyl sulfone group in our probes. Therefore, some of the unidentified bands labelled by W-sCy5-VS or W-BF-VS might correspond to proteins containing highly nucleophilic cysteines. Overall, this chemical proteomic experiment confirms that the main targets of our probes are indeed clan CA proteases.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0227341.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227341.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Top ten enriched proteins using the W-BF-VS probe.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0227341.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0227341.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene ID</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein Name</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fold-Enrichment</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_1116700</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>DPAP1</bold></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cysteine Protease</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_0827900</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>PDI8</italic></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein disulphide isomerase</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_1115400</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>FP3</bold></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cysteine Protease</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_1115300/700</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>FP2a/b</bold></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cysteine Protease</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_1205600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tetratricopeptide repeat protein</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Putative protein, unknown function</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_1302100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">G27/25</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gamete antigen 27/25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_1352500</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Thioredoxin-related protein</italic></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Putative thioredoxin</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_1108600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ERC</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ER-resident calcium binding protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_0404700</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>DPAP3</bold></td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cysteine Protease</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PF3D7_0622800</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leu-tRNA ligase</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Putative protein</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>Clan CA proteases are indicated in bold, redox enzymes containing a catalytic cysteine in italic.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Probe specificity in mammalian cells</title><p>Finally, to determine whether our probes, especially W-sCy5-VS and W-Cy5-VS, could also be used to profile mammalian clan CA proteases, we tested them in RAW macrophages, both in lysates and intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227341.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227341.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, both FY01 and our probes label a diffuse band running below the CatL band that corresponds to CatC[<xref rid="pone.0227341.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
