The study assessed health-related quality of life using EuroQol instrument and its predictors among patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 378 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus from two major health centers in Eastern Province. The study showed moderate health-related quality of life, as reported by the median index score of 0.808 with more than a quarter of patients with severe-extreme health state in some or all domains. Multiple-regression models showed that male gender, high monthly income, having no diabetes-related complications and having random blood glucose level less than 200 mg/dl were prone to have a higher index score compared to the corresponding contrary groups. The study will help in guiding the development of effective intervention programs to improve diabetes-related health-related quality of life among the Saudi population.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>We have received consent from the participants for participation in the research and publication of results.

According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reports, 1 in 11 adults aged 20&#x02013;79 years (425 million adults; 451 million if the age is expanded to 18&#x02013;99 years) had DM globally in 2017, and 90% of them were with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence and incidence of DM are increasing worldwide, and a rapid progression has been reported in middle- and low-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The new edition of the IDF Diabetes Atlas (8<sup>th</sup> ed. 2017) reports that approximately 9.2% of adults aged 18&#x02013;99 years (39.9 million people) had DM in the Middle East and North Africa Region (MENA) in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is expected that the number of people with diabetes in the MENA region will be more than double by 2045 [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Based on the IDF Diabetes Atlas report, Saudi Arabia is on the top among the MENA countries with the highest age-adjusted DM prevalence of 17.7%, and 4<sup>th</sup> place in terms of the number of people with diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IDF predicts that approximately one in four adults in Saudi Arabia will have diabetes by 2045 [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These estimates indicate that DM has reached epidemic levels, and the chronic condition threatens the global economy and health as it drains national health care budgets and reduces productivity [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>DM is a significant and growing healthcare challenge in Saudi Arabia primarily because of increased physical inactivity, consumption of unhealthy diets, obesity and sedentary lifestyles [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DM is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. DM and its complications have contributed tremendously to the burden of mortality and disability worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 identified DM as the ninth major cause of reduced life expectancy and reported that high fasting level of glucose was the third most common global risk factor for disability-adjusted life years in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. WHO reports that diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to IDF Diabetes Atlas 2017, an estimated four million deaths were directly caused by DM [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Saudi Arabia, the expected number of death due to DM was 14700 in 2017, and 70% of them were expected to be aged under 60 years [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Quality of life (QoL) indicators are solid predictors of an individual&#x02019;s competence to maintain long-term health, well -being and productivity [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Improved QoL has been regarded as a key goal of all healthcare interventions including DM management programs [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous studies reported that DM and its complications drain a substantial portion of the national healthcare budget in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hence, it is important to know the level of health-related QoL (HRQoL) of diabetes patients against the huge spending from the national budget. Identifying factors that are associated with impaired HRQoL may help policymakers to prioritize funding and implement interventions to improve the QoL.</p><p>Studies from Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], other Middle Eastern countries [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and rest of the world [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] show that diabetes impairs the QoL of patients, but the level of impairment was not the same across the studies. A recent review indicated that Saudi Arabia&#x02019;s direct spending on diabetes was almost 14% of the total health expenditure, and the study urged for improving health and HRQoL of diabetes patients in order to reduce the social and personal costs for diabetes care in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Apart from three regional level studies (from Makkah and Riyadh regions), a national level study on HRQoL among diabetes patients in Saudi Arabia has not been reported during the past decade. Importantly, any QoL studies among diabetes patients from Eastern Province, the largest region of Saudi Arabia, has not been reported previously. EQ-5D is regarded as one of generic instruments, rather than a disease-specific, that has been used extensively in research recently beside other instruments such as SF-36 [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Among these instruments, the EQ-5D has the benefit of being able to convert health states into a single index value that can be compared among diseases and used for economic evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, the present study used the EQ-5D instrument to measure HRQoL in T2DM patients in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia, and to determine the impact of socio-demographic and clinical factors on HRQoL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study setting and subjects</title><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2017 to April 2018 among 378 T2DM patients. Patients were conveniently recruited from two health centers of the King Fahad Hospital of the University, which is a major tertiary hospital in the Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. One center is located in the Khobar and Dhahran region, and the other one is located in the Dammam region. Hospital statistics of these health centers and collected demographic data of patients indicated that fair representation of patients from several geographical locations within the Eastern Province. A minimum sample size of 385 was calculated by assuming 50% of patients were adherent to treatments with the absolute precision of 0.05 and 95% confidence level. The 50% was purposively selected so that it provided the largest minimum sample size. Patients with minimum age of 18 years and with T2DM for at least 1 year were considered for this study if they provided a written informed consent. Patients with pregnancy or other medical complications were excluded from the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethical Committee at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IRB-2019-05-391).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Data collection</title><p>An Arabic version of the EQ-5D questionnaire was used after obtaining prior permission from the EuroQol Research Foundation [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The participants were interviewed in Arabic, and their socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. The EQ-5D questionnaire was filled by the participants.</p><sec id="sec005"><title>Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics</title><p>The data on participants&#x02019; gender, age, education status, monthly income, number of diabetes-related complications, current use of anti-diabetic medications (type and number), and random blood glucose level were collected.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Assessment of HRQoL</title><p>HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The EQ-5D-5L involves patient self-reporting of their health status in terms of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has a five-level severity scale (no problems, slight, moderate, severe and extreme) scored from 1 to 5. Five-digit codes for the HRQoL of each patient are obtained from the score digits; there are 3125 possible sets of values, called health states, for EQ-5D-5L. The health states would range from 11111 (perfect health) to 55555 (worst health) and can be converted into a single weighted index score (EQ-5D index) using population preference scores. We used the EQ-5D-5L value set for England to derive the EQ-5D index [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, a health state yields index score of between -0.285 and 1: index score 1 represents perfect health, 0 represents a health state equivalent to death and a score of less than 0 represents health states worse than death.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Socio-demographic and disease characteristics of the participants were summarized using descriptive statistics. Percentages and frequencies were used for the categorical variables, while median and interquartile range were calculated for the continuous variables. Association of socio-demographic and clinical factors on HRQoL was assessed using three approaches: 1). Using chi-square test where EQ-5D health states were divided into three categories (perfect health indicates no problem in domains of EQ-5D; slight/moderate indicates problems in some domains but not worse than moderate health in any domains; severe/unable indicates a health status with problems worse than moderate health in some domains). 2). Using a multiple logistic regression with forward selection (likelihood ratio) of predictor variables, where the outcome variable was a binary variable indicating &#x02018;perfect health&#x02019; (EQ-5D index = 1.000) or &#x02018;imperfect health&#x02019; (EQ-5D index &#x0003c;1.000). 3). Using a multiple linear regression where the dependent variable was the cubic function of EQ-5D index score (the cubic function ensured normally distributed residuals). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics 24.0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of participants</title><p><xref rid="pone.0227573.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of participants.

HRQoL is one of the important outcomes used to evaluate the effect of management of chronic diseases on health, and it reflects a patient&#x02019;s physical and psychosocial disease burden. The present study used EQ-5D-5L to measure the HRQoL for the first time in the Arab region. Previous studies support the use of EQ-5D-5L over EQ-5D-3L as the scale with five levels has more discriminative power than the scale with three levels in patients with T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The present study showed moderate HRQoL with the median EQ-5D index score of 0.808. A similar finding was reported by an earlier study conducted in the Riyadh region, Saudi Arabia with a mean EQ-5D index of 0.70 [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The difference in the index score may be due to the choice of the number of levels in EQ-5D, the selection of participants to study, the quality of diabetes care, or the availability of access to support services. Another two studies conducted in Riyadh and Makah regions, Saudi Arabia, but used different measurements scales, also affirmed our finding [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A recent study from Jordan reported a similar mean EQ-5D index of 0.724 in T2DM patients in Jordan [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our estimate is also consistent with findings from neighboring Middle Eastern countries [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Even though our study identified an overall moderate HRQoL, 79% of patients still had imperfect health state on some EQ-5D domains and 28% of patients reported a severe-extreme health state. Specifically, only 31% and 43% of patients expressed no problem in terms of pain/discomfort and mobility respectively. Hence, it is important to assess the influencing factors of HRQoL in patients with T2DM for the better planning of interventions to improve the physical and psychosocial burden of the disease, and hence to attain better HRQoL.</p><p>Previous studies have reported a lower HRQoL among female with diabetes compared to male with diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The present study also reported that HRQoL is gendered in favor of male patients with T2DM. The multivariate analysis indicated female gender as an independent predictor of poor HRQoL. The adjusted odds ratio indicates that the odds of having severe/extreme health state among females was 5.5 times higher than that among males. The multiple linear regression also confirms a higher EQ-5D index score among male patients compared to female patients. A recent systematic review reported a substantial difference in the level of physical activity favoring men in the Arab countries [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, the socio-cultural differences between men and women in the Arab world could be a reason for the gender difference in the HRQoL. Therefore, identifying strategies to improve the quality of life among patients with diabetes, especially among women, is of great importance.</p><p>Aging has been identified as a key factor for T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and impaired HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, it is expected a negative association between age and HRQoL among patients with diabetes. In the present study, 30% of older patients with T2DM reported severe-extreme impaired HRQoL compared to 16% among patients aged less than 50 years. The result was not statistically significant in the regression models, which may be due to the fewer representation of younger patients in our study sample.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that socioeconomic status is positively associated with HRQoL among adults with a chronic disease [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the present study, a higher proportion (40%) of patients having primary education or lower reported severe-extreme impaired HRQoL compared to patients having higher education; which is consistent with a previous study from Oman [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, a higher proportion (42%) of patients with low monthly income reported severe-extreme impaired HRQoL compared to patients having moderate/high monthly income. However, the multiple regression models did not find a significant difference in EQ-5D index between the educational levels. As Robert et al pointed out in a study, an improvement in HRQoL of people at the lowest end of the socioeconomic distribution helps substantial improvement in the HRQoL at the population level [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>The present study reports a higher proportion, but not statistically significant in the logistic regression model, of patients with severe-extreme impaired HRQoL among patients under insulin therapy compared to the contrary group. The difference in EQ-5D index score was also not significant based on the multiple regression model. HRQoL can be positively and negatively associated with insulin therapy [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Due to the beneficial effects of the insulin therapy, such as better glycemic control and lower risk of diabetic complications, better rating may have been given on domains of HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Conversely, the inconvenience associated with the insulin therapy, fear of weight gain and the risk of hypoglycemia may adversely affect the patient&#x02019;s HRQoL [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the current study, having multiple complications of diabetes was found to be negatively associated with HRQoL. Patients who had more than one complications reported lower EQ-5D score, in consistent with other studies that explored the relationship [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Many studies have previously reported that the severity of T2DM has a negative impact on quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], however, the impact of the level of RBG on HRQoL is still uncertain. Kayo et al reported RBG level was negatively associated with cognitive impairment in the elderly [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A recent study reported a non-significant relationship between quality of life with glucose levels among Iranian diabetic patients [<xref rid="pone.0227573.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, our study showed a strong negative association between random glucose level and HRQoL. The adjusted odds ratios indicate that the odds of having severe-extreme health state among patients with RBG &#x0003e;200 mg/dl was more than twofold of that among patients with RBG&#x0003c;200 mg/dl. In addition, the multiple linear regression also confirmed a significant reduction in EQ-5D index score against an increase in RBG level. A high RBG usually account for the poor control of diabetes, and hence it may negatively affect the HRQoL.</p><p>Some limitations should be noted. The study was of a cross-sectional design and thus the association that has been demonstrated in our study may not imply a causal relationship. Importantly, the study was restricted to patients from two outpatient health centers of a major tertiary hospital in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. However, a study on diabetes-related QoL has not been reported at the national level or from Eastern Province in the past decade, and hence the importance of our study. Although the study was restricted to patients with a minimum one-year duration of diabetes, the actual duration was not obtained. HbA1c, which may be a better indicator for glucose control than random glucose level, was also not collected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates a moderate HRQoL among patients with T2DM. The impaired HRQoL is mainly in terms of pain/discomfort and mobility due to diabetes. The results showed that male gender, high income, without complications and good glucose control have relatively better quality of life. The study will help in guiding the development of effective intervention programs to improve T2DM related HRQoL among the Saudi population. Such programs should target especially at groups with female gender, older age, low socio-economic status, multiple complications of diabetes and high RBG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Muhammed Aftab for his valuable advice on study design and selection of the HRQoL instrument.

Usually the use of abbreviations is not suitable in the abstract unless you clarify them even international abbreviations.</p><p>Corrected (Page 2)</p><p>3. The methodology needs to be revised; you have to mention how you determine the amount of sample and why you select two centers and how many centers in total in the area, all these things should be mentioned.</p><p>We have revised the methodology section by including details of sample size calculation (Page 5, L94-97) and sampling methodology (Page 5, L89-94). </p><p>We calculated a minimum sample size of 385 assuming 50% of patients were adherent to treatments with the absolute precision of 0.05 and 95% confidence level. The 50% was purposively selected so that it provided the largest minimum sample size. As mentioned in the methodology section, we considered two health centres in the Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia out of five state owned general hospitals in the province. These two centres, which are affiliated with a largest university in the region, serves larger volume of patients from different geographical locations in the region compared to other hospitals. </p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>1. According to my knowledge, it is a novel paper in its field opening new horizons for further evidence. In addition, the object as well as the results are appropriately discussed in the context of previous literature explaining the importance of the manuscript in its field. Authors succeed to present their data in a clear way adding information to the existing literature.</p><p>Therefore, I have no corrections or further work to propose for the improvement of the manuscript and therefore it can be published unaltered.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for his good feedback.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227573.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reveiwers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227573.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0227573.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227573.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fawzy</surname><given-names>Manal S.</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Manal S.
