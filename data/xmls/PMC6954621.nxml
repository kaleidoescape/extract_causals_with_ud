However, the underlying mechanism of its involvement in breast cancer remains largely unknown. With our research, our endeavor is to explore the role of the CDX2/let-7b/COL11A1 axis in breast cancer cell activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 86 patients with breast cancer. Human breast cancer epithelial cell line MCF-7 was treated with over-expressed CDX2, let-7b mimic, shRNA against COL11A1 and their negative controls. The expression of CDX2, let-7b, and COL11A1 in the tissues and cells was determined by RT-qPCR. Interactions among CDX2, let-7b, and COL11A1 were detected by ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter assay, respectively. After different transfections, cell invasion, migration, and proliferation abilities were determined by Transwell and EdU assays. Lastly, tumor xenografts in nude mice were established and hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess the tumor growth and lymph node metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">CDX2 and let-7b were poorly expressed in breast cancer cells and tissues. CDX2 bound to let-7b and promoted the expression of let-7b, which contrarily inhibited the expression of COL11A1. Cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and metastasis were stimulated when CDX2 and let-7b were depleted or COL11A1 was over-expressed. Xenograft tumors growth and metastasis were in accordance with the results of cellular experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">In agreement with these observations, we could reach a conclusion that CDX2 could promote let-7b expression, which may exert an inhibitory effect on the proliferation, migration, and metastasis of breast cancer cells via repressing the expression of COL11A1, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Migration</kwd><kwd>Invasion</kwd><kwd>CDX2</kwd><kwd>let-7b</kwd><kwd>COL11A1</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Harbin Applied Technology Research and Development Project Plan (Harbin Science and Technology Bureau)</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 2016RAQXJ174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhigao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, accounting for more than 30% of new cancer diagnoses in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Metastasis of breast cancer is a complicated process involving invasion and migration of cancer cells, and blood transversing, and it often associated with high mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Unfortunately, therapies for metastatic breast cancer are limited, and remain to generally incurable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, a prior study suggested that breast cancer was affected by gene regulatory networks, in which transcriptional factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) were the most frequently mentioned. Hence, further exploration of the transcriptional factors and miRNAs in the progression of breast cancer might shed some light on prospective diagnoses and management therapies for the highly prevalent malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Transcriptional factors are well-known to play critical roles in numerous human diseases including cancers, and regarded as key regulators for new therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One such factor, caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), a member of the caudal-related homeobox gene family and a mediator of apoptosis in tissues, was found in intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recently, a study documented reduced CDX2 expression in breast cancer, while its methylation level is elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Transcriptional factors have also been demonstrated to play important roles in breast cancer by interacting with miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. MiRNAs, also known as non-coding RNAs have been linked to mediate target genes expression and participate in different cancer cells proliferation, invasion, migration, and metastasis via several signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The let-7b was frequently reported with a decreased expression in cancers. For instance, the let-7 family members (let-7a, let-7b, and let-7g) have been demonstrated to be poorly-expressed in the patients diagnosed with breast cancer with lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Previous work further illustrated the targeting relationship between miRNA and collagen in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, through bioinformatics and a dual luciferase reporter gene assay, COL3A1 was suggested as a direct target of let-7b in neuronal injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Collagen was reported to be active in numerous biological processes in cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Collagen type XI alpha 1 chain (COL11A1), a subtype of fibrillary type collagen, plays a role in extracellular matrix and tissues and was over-expressed in human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. COL11A1 has also been regarded as a promising prognostic biomarker for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. On the basis of existing literature data, we carried out studies in an effort to investigate the possible CDX2 may act as a significant cytokine in breast cancer. This study distinguishes from other studies by emphasizing the role of transcriptional factors and miRNAs in the invasion, migration, and metastasis of breast cancer epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical statement</title><p id="Par18">All patients participated in this study signed informed consent and the study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committees of Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital.

In addition, adjacent normal tissue samples were also resected from all patients as controls. The samples used were not subjected to preoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, and were diagnosed as non-specific invasive breast cancer by more than two associate chief physicians at the Department of Pathology.

For example, breast cancer metastases can be widely disseminated to several regions in the human body including the brain, bone, liver, and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, metastasis often occurred before diagnosis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is trivial to seek effective prognostic markers to predict metastasis in breast cancer. Burgeoning genetic researches have been widely reported on tumor cells invasion, migration and metastasis. A previous study highlighted the importance of genetic factors elucidation in the pathogenesis of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, limited studies have explored the gene regulatory networks implicated in breast cancer. In the current study, we proposed that breast cancer metastasis was correlated with CDX2, and CDX2 could inhibit breast cancer progression by up-regulating let-7b.</p><p id="Par46">Initially, we found that CDX2, which was frequently studied in intestinal cancer, was associated with the survival of patients with breast cancer. Our findings further indicated that CDX2 was poorly expressed in breast cancer, while the over-expressed CDX2 diminished the migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer epithelial cells. As a homeotic transcriptional factor, CDX2 was poorly expressed in colon cancer and associated with invasion and metastasis of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it would be reasonable to suggest that poor expression of CDX2 is correlated with migration and invasion of breast cancer epithelial cells, and could be countered by over-expression of CDX2.</p><p id="Par47">A previous study has demonstrated that miRNAs were regulated by CDX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Similarly, we uncovered that CDX2 inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer epithelial cells by up-regulating let-7b. Let-7b has also been previously highlighted as a tumor suppressor due to its involvement in various mechanisms, including cell proliferation and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similarly, another study displayed that let-7b was poorly expressed in patients diagnosed with breast cancer at clinical stages I&#x02013;IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, our data demonstrated that let-7b mimic transfection resulted in the inhibition of cells invasion and migration, while poor prognoses were occurred in breast cancer patients with reduced let-7b expression, suggesting that let-7b may be a potential biomarker for breast cancer cell behavior. With regard to regulation of miRNAs in cancers, accumulating evidence put emphasis on the specific miRNA-regulated mechanisms and indicated that let-7b could serve as an effective index in distinguishing breast cancer clinical behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, He et al. found that CDX2 bound to the promoter region and inhibited miR-145-5p transcription, thus relieving the suppressive effect of miR-145-5p on the translation of small ubiquitin-like modifier protein-specific protease 1 and affecting the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the present study, we first predicted the targeting relationship between CDX2 and let-7b using the TargetScan website with breast cancer microarray data, and examined the binding of CDX2 to the let-7b promoter region with ChIP assay. Based on these experiments, it was confirmed that CDX2 targets let-7b. These findings highlight the gene regulatory network, where genes and miRNAs were intertwined in breast cancer epithelial cells activities.</p><p id="Par48">Furthermore, we explored the target genes of let-7b in the current study. The COL11A1 gene was screened using the TargetScan database, and subsequently, the binding sites between let-7b and COL11A1 were predicted by the TargetScanHuman website. The targeting relationship was substantiated by a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Meanwhile, a prior research reported that COL11A1 was highly expressed in cancers and potentiated the invasion by coordinating with invasion-sensing biomarkers. However, there were no reports on the direct association between COL11A1 and breast cancer in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Another study unraveled that COL11A1 expression was found in fibroblasts associated with breast cancer and played a vital role in the metastasis of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
