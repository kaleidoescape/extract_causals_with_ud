Starting from the whole venom of <italic>V</italic>.<italic>velutina</italic>, several chromatographic steps allowed to purify the phospholipase (named Vesp v 1), as well as the antigen 5 (Vesp v 5, the only allergenic component described as such so far). The two hyaluronidase isoforms found (Vesp v 2A and Vesp v 2B) cannot be separated from each other, but they are partially purified and characterized. Purity of the isolated proteins in shown by SDSPAGE, as well as by the results of the N-terminal sequencing. This characterization and nLC-MS/MS data provide most of the sequence for Vesp v 1 and Vesp v 5 (72 and 84% coverage, respectively), confirming that the whole sequences of the isolated natural components match with the data available in public transcriptomic databases. It is of particular interest that Vesp v 1 is a glycosylated phospholipase, a fact that had only described so far for the corresponding allergen components of <italic>Dolichovespula maculata</italic> and <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>. The availability of the complete sequences of <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> components permits comparison with homologous sequences from other Hymenoptera. These data demonstrate the higher similarity among the species of the genera <italic>Vespa</italic> and <italic>Vespula</italic>, in comparison to <italic>Polistes</italic> species, as it is especially observed with the hyaluronidases isoforms: the isoform Vesp v 2A only exists in the former genera, and not in <italic>Polistes</italic>; in addition, the most abundant isoform (Vesp v 2B) exhibits 93% sequence identity with the Ves v 2 isoform of <italic>Vespula vulgaris</italic>. Finally, the isolated components might be useful for improving the diagnosis of patients that could be allergic to stings of this invasive Asian hornet, as it has been the case of an improved diagnosis and treatment of other Hymenoptera-sensitized patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>All the authors who are sending this paper, as mentioned in our affiliations, are employees of &#x0201c;ALK-Abell&#x000f3;&#x0201d;, belonging to the Research and Development (CMC R&#x00026;D) in Madrid-Spain, and Research department (Global Research) in Horsholm-Denmark.

Since then, it has extended its presence through the north of Spain, up to the north of Portugal, causing socio-economic concerns due to its important expansive capacity, also considering that they frequently attack honey-bee hives to feed their nests. Solutions for this invasion are being considered in different ways in several European countries [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. From the allergologic point of view, it is also a concern, as demonstrated in the North of Spain [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], when the first cases of anaphylactic shocks were described, and when &#x0201c;antigen 5&#x0201d;, from the venom of these Asian hornets, was identified as the most important allergen in a group of eight sensitized patients.</p><p>The data we have obtained from these purified components, confirm the whole sequence data available in transcriptomic databases since 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and this allows a thorough comparison with homologous components from other Hymenoptera. Moreover, the purified components will be used to demonstrate their relevance as allergens, by Component Resolved Diagnosis (CRD), in studies performed in platforms that can measure specific IgE in the sera of allergic patients ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), which are useful to differentiate which can be the sensitizing species for each patient, as we also published in the past ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), differentiating on <italic>Vespula</italic> versus. <italic>Polistes</italic> sensititization.</p><p>The nomenclature used for naming the purified components, will consider what is suggested for allergenic proteins by the WHO/IUIS (World Health Organization / International Union of Immunological Societies) Committee ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), considering that only the antigen 5 (named Vesp v 5) has been described as such so far; the phospholipase (Vesp v 1) and hyaluronidases (Vesp v 2) must still be considered as potential allergenic components.</p><p>In summary, in this work we isolate the main potential allergenic components of the <italic>V</italic>.<italic>velutina</italic> venom, and show the potential interest on the availability of these purified components: their characterization allow a closer understanding of similarities among different Hymenoptera venom components, and will surely be useful in a better diagnosis and treatment of allergic patients to stings of this Asian hornet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The relevant natural venom components (A1 phospholipase, antigen 5 and hyaluronidases) were purified from lyophilized <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> venom sac extract of individual hornets collected in Europe (ALK Source Materials Inc., Spring Mills, U.S.A.; batch 01071301AH). The purification was performed as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and in a similar manner as performed with other natural allergens from <italic>Vespula vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Polistes dominula</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The purified proteins were analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (Novex-Tricine, 10&#x02013;20% acrylamide, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and silver- or Coomassie blue-stained, depending on the needs of the analysis (SDSPAGE was silver stained, according to [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). The enzymatic activity of phospholipase and hyaluronidases was verified when needed by the methods of Habermann [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Richman and Baer [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], respectively, using <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> venom (ALK Source Materials Inc., Spring Mills, U.S.A.) preparation as reference.</p><p>The purity and identity of the purified proteins was also confirmed, according to [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], by N-terminal sequencing analyses (direct analysis of the protein in solution), performed at CIB Protein Chemistry Service (CSIC, Madrid, Spain).</p><p>In the case of Vesp v 1 and Vesp v 5 additional nLC-MS/MS (nano Liquid Chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) analyses were performed from the bands extracted from an SDSPAGE stained with Coomassie blue (Colloidal Blue Staining, LC6025, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.): this protein identification by nLC-MS/MS was carried out in the Proteomics and Genomics Facility (CIB-CSIC, Madrid&#x02014;Spain), a member of ProteoRed-ISCIII network, according to the method described in [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For the MS analysis, Peptides were trapped onto a Acclaim PepMap 100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA U.S.A.) precolumn, and then eluted onto a column Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 column, inner diameter 75 &#x003bc;m, 25 cm long, 3 &#x003bc;m particle size (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA U.S.A.) and separated using a 130 min gradient (100 min from 0% -35% Buffer B; 20 min from 35% -45% Buffer B; 5 min from 45% -95% Buffer B; 4min 95% Buffer B and 1 min 0% Buffer B; (Buffer A: 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile and Buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow-rate of 250 nL/min on a nanoEasy HPLC (Proxeon) coupled to a nanoelectrospray (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectra were acquired on a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the positive ion mode. Full-scan MS spectra (m/z 300&#x02013;18000) were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 and the 15 most intense ions were selected for collision induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation in the linear ion trap with a normalized collision energy of 35%. Singly charged ions and unassigned charge states were rejected. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with exclusion duration of 45 s.</p><p>MS data were analysed according to [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Mass spectra raw files were searched against an in&#x02013;house specific database with known venom allergen sequences and sequences extracted from transcriptomic databases, using the Sequest search engine through Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4.1.14) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Search parameters included a maximum of two missed cleavages allowed, carbamidomethyl of cysteines as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications. Precursor and fragment mass tolerance were set to 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. Identified peptides were validated using Percolator algorithm with a q-value threshold of 0.01. The data generated by these procedures, that has allowed the characterization of the <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> components included in this manuscript are available at the Mass spectrometry Interactive Virtual Enviroment (MassIVE), with the reference PXD015381 as ProteomeExchange identifier.</p><p>The publicly available transcriptomic data for the Asian hornet <italic>Vespa velutina nigrithorax</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] was downloaded from the GEO database (SRA experiment SRX595647). The sequence data was originally obtained from RNA extracted from the venom glands of Asian hornet species collected in China ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Using the FASTX-Toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</ext-link>), the sequencing reads were trimmed and filtered with respect to quality, trimming bases from the ends with quality score below 20 and keeping reads that were at least 50 bases long after trimming, resulting in 203,886,099 reads (99.9% of the original data set). <italic>De novo</italic> transcriptome assembly was performed using the Trinity software (v2.1.1) [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Furthermore, sequence homology searches were performed with the program BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Tool) [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) provided by the NCBI (National Centre of Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec003"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Vesp v 1, the A1-phospholipase from the venom sac extract was purified as in [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], by directly using as specific affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g001">Fig 1</xref>) followed by an ion exchange chromatography (Mono-S column, GE Healthcare, Upsala, Sweden). The flowthrough (FT) from the previous affinity chromatography was applied onto a Heparin-Sepharose column (GE-Heathcare, Upsala, Sweden) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g002">Fig 2</xref>), which permits the separation of Vesp v 5 and of two isoforms of Hyaluronidase (namely, Vesp v 2A and 2B). Final purification of Vesp v 5 is achieved by an additional Size-Exclusion-Chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex75 column (GE Helthcare, Upsala, Sweden). In the chromatographic profile shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g002">Fig 2</xref>, and additional test was performed in some fractions: the measurement of the relative specific activity of hyaluronidases by the method of Richman ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]).

Besides their direct analysis by nLC-MS/MS also confirm that most of the peptides found in these analyses correspond exactly to the sequences extracted from the <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> transcriptomic data ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g004">Fig 4</xref>. As it can be observed, 72% and 87% coverage, for Vesp v 1 and Vesp v 5 respectively, have been experimentally determined by this combination of techniques. An interesting feature for Vesp v 1, is that it is a glycosylated phospholipase; this can be deducted from the fact that nLC-MS/MS studies have not provided any data on the peptide in which Asn-61 is potentially predicted as N-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g004">Fig 4A</xref>); on the contrary, Asn-40 is not glycosylated, since the peptide containing this amino acid is clearly identified by nLC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This is therefore another peculiar A1-phospholipase, since they are not usually glycosylated (so far, this had been only described for two phospholipases: Dol m I from <italic>Dolichovespula maculata</italic> ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) and for Sol i 1, from the imported fire ants ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Moreover, the glycosylation of Vesp v 1 is also confirmed by the higher apparent molecular weight this protein exhibits in an SDSPAGE (36.1kDa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g001">Fig 1</xref>), in comparison with the 34.0kDa that correspond to the polypeptide part of its complete CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0225672.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0225672.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Complete coding sequence of Vesp v 1 and Vesp v 5, and characterization of its sequences.</title><p>Panel A shows the Vesp v 1 CDS extracted from the trancriptomic data of <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> (304 amino acids, 33957.2 Da), highlighting in yellow the peptides identified by nLC-MS/MS analysis, and in green the N-terminal sequence determined (see <xref rid="pone.0225672.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover the two potential N-glycosylation sites for Asn ([<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) are also indicated by horizontal arrows, but only the second predicted site seems to be glycosylated (Asn-61, as explained in the text). Panel B shows the CDS for Vesp v 5 (202 amino acids, 22717.7 Da), similarly coloured as in panel B for Vesp v 1; no N-glycosylation is predicted for this antigen 5.

Vesp v 5 exhibits an apparent molecular weight of 23.5kDa in SDSPAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g002">Fig 2</xref>), close to the 22.7 kDa calculated size from the complete CDS shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g004">Fig 4</xref> (as expected, antigen 5 is not a glycosylated component).</p><p>The major allergen Vesp v 5, and the potential major allergen Vesp v 1, have been purified to homogeneity, and most of their CDS determined (with an 87% and 74% of total coverage, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g004">Fig 4</xref>), matching perfectly with the extracted data from the <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> transcriptome [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This also confirms that these sequence data, obtained from the RNA extracted from the venom glands of the hornet species present in China [<xref rid="pone.0225672.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], match exactly with the experimental data determined from the isolated natural components from the venom from species present in Europe, where the source material was collected. These data are very relevant, since they show that there have not been evolutive variations in the amino acid sequences of these venom components, in spite of the potential regional variations of the Asian hornet in its original location and the analogous components produced in the venom of <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> species that entered in Europe in the first decade of the year 2000, and have then expanded its presence throughout several European countries. In addition, it is important to mention that the actual sequences that are presented in this manuscript are the only existing isoforms found in the whole <italic>Vespa velutina</italic> transcriptome, i.e. no additional isoforms were found for Vesp v 1, Vesp v 5 or the two Vesp v 2 isoforms.</p><p>In the case of the two only hyaluronidases isoforms found (named Vesp v 2A and Vesp v 2B), the complete CDS have not been extensively characterized experimentally, but the exact match of the first 10 amino acid residues of each isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g003">Fig 3</xref> / <xref rid="pone.0225672.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) permits to reasonably think that the whole CDS will be those extracted from the complete transcriptomic database. Nevertheless, the partial characterization of these hyaluronidases isoforms, is completed, apart from the purity shown in the chromatographic peak containing the aforementioned isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g002">Fig 2</xref>), also considering that the enzymatic activity for hyaluronidase was specifically measured in fractions &#x0201c;c&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;d&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;e&#x0201d; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225672.g002">Fig 2</xref>, and as it was the case for the <italic>Vespula vulgaris</italic> hyaluronidase (Ves v 2) purified by Monsalve et al.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript is technically sound and needs only minor revisions, which are pointed in pdf file together with a few comments and/or observations.</p><p>It is written in understandable English. Highlights should be pointed out by the authors in the Abstract emphasizing the contribution of this study.</p><p>All the experiments were carried out with scientific and ethical criteria. The results presented in tables and figures, are essentially important so that the reader can follow all the experimental approaches used, as well as the conclusions that they allowed to arrive. All of them are of quality, demonstrate the results obtained and supported the conclusion established by the authors. Images of electrophoretic gels and blots are free from apparent manipulation.</p><p>The results obtained here, open new perspectives to further biochemical and immunological studies with the proteins purified in this work and other components available to confirm which will be the best treatment for sensitized patients, that have become allergic after stings of the wasps and hornets, until a new population of patients who will develop allergenicity by Vespa velutina stings, as the culprit insect.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript just describes the molecular characterization and purification of a phospholipase (Vesp v 1), an antigen 5 (Vesp v 5) and two hyaluronidase isoforms (Vesp v 2A and Vesp v 2B) from the Vespa velutina nigrithorax wasp venom (Hymenoptera, Vespidae).</p><p>This wasp is known as yellow-legged Asian Hornet. It Is a species of hornet indigenous to Southeastern Asia. It is of concern as an invasive species in some other countries and in Portugal, it predates honey-bees and other insects.</p><p>It has been studied for causing major human accidents in the North-Western parts of the Spanish coast.</p><p>In case this paper is approved for publication by PlosOne, I would rather suggest the authors to answer the following questions:</p><p>- What is effectively the extent of this wasp on human accidents?</p><p>- What is the significance of the translational medicine standpoint for this type of research, I&#x000b4;d say, to mitigate allergic reactions (treatment) and better diagnosis?</p><p>- How can differences in sensitization to immune reaction between Vespula and Polistes be explained since they are very close phylogenetically (daughter group), since both belong to the Vespidae family?</p><p>- The most important concern of this manuscript is: authors used a pool of wasp venoms from all over Europe. Doesn&#x000b4;t this make it difficult because of individual variations in wasp venoms from different regions of Europe? I mean, antigen detection by antibodies should be specific as well as treatment. We must know exactly which immunogenic compounds are present in a venom gland of a specific species for the detection and later medication. Therefore, if you use a pool, how effective can these two (diagnosis and treatment) factors be, in addition to those molecules evidenced in this study? Is there any study showing that there are differences between venoms of this wasp, due to food, from different regions?</p><p>- Is there any specificity and / or similarity between the isolated molecules and those already well-known from other sources of hymenoptera and / or other animals?</p><p>- Actually, the discussion of the manuscript is contained from page 335 to 362. Therefore, it is quite powerless and does not, in my view, match the level of the journal.</p><p>- Finally, there is no consistent discussion of isolated molecules and effective actions to solve medical and immunological problems.</p><p>- Which chromatography method was used: FPLC or HPLC?</p><p>- What is a "direct analysis from the protein in solution"?</p><p>- No reagents used in the study have the company's city and country of origin.</p><p>- The figures are not of good quality and need to be improved.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
