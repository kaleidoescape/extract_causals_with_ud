The often-severe symptoms of CDI include diarrhea, dehydration, and abdominal pain. Patients often relapse following symptom resolution, resulting in increased morbidity. Previous research on the impact of CDI centered around the health-care system, clinician perspectives and economic burden, but not on patient experiences. The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of CDI on patients in Canada.</p></sec><sec id="S2002"><title>Methods</title><p>The Gastrointestinal Society conducted online surveys and gathered data from 167 qualifying participants, who were either patients or their non-treating caregivers. Quantitative parameters were analyzed by descriptive and comparative statistics and contextualized with qualitative insights derived from thematic analysis of open-ended questions.</p></sec><sec id="S2003"><title>Results</title><p>Our findings, which focused on clinical parameters such as prior exposure to health-care settings, antibiotic use, and patients&#x02019; symptoms, mirrored findings from previous research. Interestingly, most surveyed respondents experienced delays in diagnosis and treatment; 29% waited 6&#x02013;30 days and 10% over 30 days. This delayed diagnosis was further complicated by the report that 62% of respondents did not experience symptom resolution within 7 days of initiating treatment. Importantly, our results suggest a lasting impact after the resolution of CDI and we saw a reduction of self-assessed quality of life from prior to post CDI. Patients&#x02019; priorities regarding their experience with CDI focused around concerns about the health-care system, particularly time to diagnosis and treatment, concerns about antibiotic usage and needs from health-care providers.</p></sec><sec id="S2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first Canadian report on patients&#x02019; experience with CDI. Our data highlight the symptom-related impact on patients and the long-lasting effect on the quality of life including emotional impact. Reducing time to diagnosis and improving patient education are important priorities to attenuate the impact on patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>nosocomial infection</kwd><kwd><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> colitis</kwd><kwd><italic>C difficile</italic></kwd><kwd>CDI</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI) is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea in adults<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with infection rates increasing since 1999.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Symptoms range from mild diarrhea to potentially lethal pseudomembranous colitis.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Typically, colonic microbiota act as barrier in the gut, providing resistance to CDI. However, disruption of host microbiota, most commonly through antibiotic treatment, results in increased susceptibility to infection.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, 20% of adults over the age of 65 are asymptomatically colonized by <italic>C. difficile</italic>, which increases the chance of CDI and may act as potential vehicles of transmission in a healthcare setting.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Several research groups and national programs have surveyed health-care sites and treating physicians, to evaluate incidence, prevalence, infection control practices and economic burden of CDI in Canada. In 1997, two independent groups surveyed Canadian hospitals and showed a national average of 3.06 cases per 1000 admissions in large hospitals with over 200 beds<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and 5.9 cases per 1000 patient admissions across 19 Canadian Hospital Epidemiology Committee member sites.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A follow-up study in 2009 by the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program found similar numbers with 4.6 cases per 1000 admissions.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> While this latter study emphasized patient outcomes using a prospective surveillance method, they did not directly survey patients. In 2011, Wilkinson et al<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> surveyed 2880 health-care facilities across Canada, 943 (33%) of which responded to the survey, and identified a broad variation in infection prevention and control practices that were implemented to curb CDI. Overall, acute care sites were more likely to submit liquid stools for testing, compared to mixed care and long-term care sites.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In 2015, Levy et al<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> analyzed direct and indirect medical costs due to CDI in Canada based on nation-wide rates of CDI associated with hospital visits. They estimated the total cost of CDI to the Canadian economy to be over CAD $280 million, 90% of which was directly related to in-hospital cost.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A recent Ontario population-based matched cohort study based on personal health information identified an increased risk for all-cause mortality and higher cost compared to uninfected control subjects.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Despite a push toward improved patient experience and a patient-centered health-care system,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> no research group has surveyed Canadian patients living with CDI to understand their perspectives and experiences. Madeo et al<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> conducted a pilot study on patient-reported knowledge, awareness and beliefs on nosocomial infections. In their small mixed-method survey of 110 patients, they concluded that patients were aware of the risk of nosocomial infections. However, patients lacked knowledge on routes of infection and prevention. Patients&#x02019; main source of knowledge was television and newspaper, with MRSA being named most often as a source of nosocomial infection.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In a small interview-based study with 15 patients, Madeo and Boyack<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> researched the needs and lived experiences of elderly patients with CDI and identified four key themes of experiences &#x02013; &#x0201c;physical suffering and impact on daily activities of living, lack of control over bowel function, lack of understanding of the illness, and issues around privacy and dignity&#x0201d;. They also found patients lacked an understanding as to how they became infected. As practice points, the group recommended increased patient education and improved staff-patient communication.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> While a few studies investigated patient experiences with nosocomial infections, most focused on MRSA and none of these studies have been conducted in the Canadian context.</p><p>To address this knowledge gap, the Gastrointestinal (GI) Society developed a web-based survey to collect lived experiences and perspectives from patients with CDI. Questions were focused on disease severity and management, quality of life, and open-ended input on the most important priority to improve the patient&#x02019;s experience with CDI.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Study Design and Recruitment</title><p>The GI (Gastrointestinal) Society developed a mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) survey with guidance from their medical advisory board as part of their ongoing quality control.

</p><p>Respondents included residents of all Canadian provinces, primarily from Ontario (32%), British Columbia (24%), and Alberta (16%). While the survey was offered in French and English, uptake in Quebec, the second most populated province, was low with only 8% of respondents. We did not receive responses from the Territories. A total of 19% of surveyed respondents identified as health-care professionals with the majority (49%) working in a hospital setting. Furthermore, we observed a bias toward female respondents, an observation made by other researchers when employing online surveys.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec id="S0003-S2002"><title>Health-Care System Exposure Preceding Diagnosis</title><p>CDI has been most commonly correlated with exposure to antibiotics and prior hospitalization for non-CDI related reasons.<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In line with these correlations, 63% of surveyed respondents indicated taking antibiotics in the 3 months prior to being diagnosed (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Most antibiotics were prescribed by physicians, whereas 12% of respondents were prescribed antibiotics by their dentist (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A total of 73% of respondents indicated to have experienced at least one concurrent situation, for example a medical condition or childbirth.

Only 25% indicated that they were hospitalized or living in a long-term care home. Furthermore, 8% indicated &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; and further specified they had been in contact with a health facility prior to developing symptoms. Examples of health facility contact were &#x0201c;shortly after being discharged from the hospital&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;working as RN in ER&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;visiting a patient in hospital&#x0201d;. Of those hospitalized, 69% stated that their hospital stay was prolonged because of their CDI and 33% required further hospitalization for their first infection. Importantly, these percentages might not accurately reflect the real distribution because 24 respondents selected &#x0201c;I was already in the hospital&#x0201d;, while 41% indicated their symptoms began while in the hospital. When asked for the length of their first hospital stay, 30% indicated 1&#x02013;6 days, 25% indicated 1&#x02013;2 weeks, 26% indicated 3&#x02013;4 weeks, and 19% reported &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; and further specified times between 6 weeks and 6 months (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).

Furthermore, the analysis showed that the majority of those previously hospitalized reported the time of their hospital stay instead of &#x0201c;not applicable&#x0201d;. This reduced internal consistency is a limitation to our report, based on the question design. Overall, these findings confirm previous observations that most respondents had been exposed to either antibiotics, health-care settings, or both prior to their first experience of CDI.<fig id="F0002" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Situations surrounding first <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection.

As expected, the majority (94%) of respondents were treated with antibiotics for their first CDI (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), but 6% indicated they did not receive treatment for their CDI at all. Of these, 27% indicated they concurrently used probiotics while 8% of all respondents used only probiotics to treat their first CDI. In contrast, 96% of respondents treated their subsequent CDI with antibiotics and 47% of these used probiotics in addition to antibiotics (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We did not ask whether people received their probiotics after consultation with a health-care professional.<fig id="F0004" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Diagnosis and treatment.

More people received FMT for subsequent CDI, albeit much less than expected. A total of five respondents out of 67 who had experienced subsequent CDI indicated treatment by FMT. The open-ended section of the survey revealed that these participants experienced FMT to be the cure to their CDI with one participant commenting they would have liked to try FMT, but it was not available to them. All respondents who received FMTs also indicated they were treated with antibiotics. Overall, these responses demonstrate that most patients were treated with antibiotics as the first line of therapy and more are turning to probiotics during recurrent infections.</p></sec><sec id="S0003-S2004"><title>CDI Impact on Life</title><p>CDI can have a devastating impact on patients and we were interested whether there may be any lasting impact on self-assessed quality of live (QoL). To address this, three questions on the survey accessed participants&#x02019; QoL with scores ranging from the &#x0201c;6&#x0201d; (able to carry on normal activity including work; no special care needed, social activities not restricted) to &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; (unable to care for self and requiring institutional or hospital care). Detailed qualifiers for all QoL numbers are listed in <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The majority (77%) of responding patients (patient group) who identified as &#x0201c;person who has been infected with the <italic>C. difficile</italic> bacterium&#x0201d; reported a QoL of 6 before their first CDI experience (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, respondents who identified as &#x0201c;caregiver/loved one of a person who has been infected with the <italic>C. difficile</italic> bacterium, but not in a health care provider capacity&#x0201d; (caregiver group) and responded <italic>in lieu</italic> of the patient, indicated a lower median QoL of 5 before the patient&#x02019;s first CDI experience, with interquartile ranges of QoL of 3 and QoL of 6 (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The impact that CDI has on patients was evident from the reduced QoL participants indicated for their worst experience of CDI (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The patient group reported a median QoL of 4 with 37% reporting to be unable to care for self (QoL of 1 and 2), 35% unable to work and/or needing some assistance with normal activities (QoL of 3 and 4) and 28% with minor or no restrictions to their normal activities (QoL of 5 and 6). Again, the caregiver group indicated a lower QoL compared to the patient group with a median QoL of 3 (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, while 41% of this group reported a QoL of 1, compared to only 23% in the patient group, 30% of caregivers indicated a QoL of 6 at the worst stage of CDI compared to only 10% of the patient group. Taken together, these observations suggest that someone who experienced a reduced quality of life prior to CDI, experienced on average a more severe impact on their quality of life during active disease. However, a subgroup might be less affected by the symptoms of CDI.<table-wrap id="T0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Survey Qualifiers to Query Quality of Life Scores</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Score</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Qualifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Able to carry on normal activity including work; no special care needed, social activities not restricted</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Able to carry on with most normal activities and able to work, but social activities restricted</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Able to carry on with most activities but unable to work</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Some assistance needed with normal activities</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unable to care for self but able to stay at home</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unable to care for self and requiring institutional or hospital care</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

To answer this question, we asked participants for their current quality of life. We acknowledge that this question does not conclusively address our question as participants might have answered the survey at different stages after recovering. We found a dramatically reduced median QoL of 1 in the caregiver group but cannot conclude that this QoL is related to CDI or another disease. We also observed a slightly reduced median QoL of 5.5 and broader interquartile ranges in the patient group. Those patients who received FMT to treat their CDI reported current QoL at the same level as before their first CDI experience and perceived FMT to have cured their CDI. Current clinical trials on FMT include assessing health-related quality of life measures and will likely be able to provide further insights into this observation. For the purpose of our analysis, we assumed that people would not have filled out our survey while experiencing CDI symptoms and therefore &#x0201c;currently&#x0201d; means post-CDI. This is a limitation to our analysis and follow-up research should address this point. While 77% indicated a QoL of 6 pre-CDI, 50% indicated this post-CDI. As analyzed by paired analyses, these respondents now indicate a QoL of 5 (24%), of 4 (18%), and of 3 (8%). From the open-ended question, we learned that many respondents suffer from long-term consequences after their CDI was cured. We did not have enough participants to further stratify our analysis based on time between symptom onset and diagnosis or treatment. Overall, the data demonstrate a significant impact of CDI on patient&#x02019;s self-assessed QoL and the lasting impact CDI has on a subgroup of patients, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and a rapid cure.</p></sec><sec id="S0003-S2005"><title>Most Important Priority to Improve Patient Experience</title><p>In the final two survey questions, participants were asked to highlight their most important priority in improving the experience with CDI and to share further comments. We found their answers to overlap sufficiently, compiled both questions and analyzed the answers using inductive thematic analysis. While reading the answers, four major themes emerged, each of which we sub-categorized into two to six individual codes (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=229539.pdf">Appendix 2</ext-link></underline>). We then compared our codebook with the key insights described in the 15-patient interview study by Madeo and Boyack<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and identified each of their themes in our cohort. The key emerging themes in our survey were concerns about the healthcare system (63%), concerns about antibiotics (17%), needs from healthcare providers (45%) and impact on life (49%) (<xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Percentages represent number of people who responded to the open-ended questions and not all survey respondents. Most of those who answered the question on important priorities commented on several themes in their response. Of the comments about the healthcare system, we found the most important priority to be time to diagnosis (26%) and speed and selection of treatment (10%), which relates to the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment discussed above. Importantly, 5% highlighted that they received a wrong initial diagnosis while 4% were not referred to a specialist fast enough. A total of 13% observed insufficient prevention protocols such as &#x0201c;I witnessed cleaning personnel not cleaning hospitals properly, while I have been in Emergency at all hours&#x0201d;. Furthermore, 6% experienced poor attitudes by doctors and hospital staff to patients, for example. &#x0201c;I had a nurse berate me in emerge because I &#x02018;contaminated&#x02019; the bathroom, screaming that in front of all the patients&#x0201d;. This insight is reflected in Madeo and Boyack&#x02019;s<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> theme as &#x0201c;issues around privacy and dignity&#x0201d;.

Overall, the responses support and mirror our insights from the quantitative portion of the survey and highlight a need for further education of health-care professionals to compassionately deal with CDI in a fast and effective manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This report is the first survey of Canadian residents with lived experience of CDI and among the first internationally. We recognize that a limitation of our study is potential selection bias, as survey recruitment targeted followers of the GI Society. Patients who experience recurrence or additional gastrointestinal conditions might be more likely to follow the GI Society which might have skewed our results toward those more severe cases. The survey link was also shared by internal medicine doctors, which we believe reduces possible selection bias. Follow-up studies to our exploratory survey should aim to get a random sample with a larger sample size from across Canada to minimize selection bias and improve generalizability.</p><p>Our results confirm expected clinical parameters and report important insights regarding the lasting impact of CDI on patients&#x02019; lives. As previously reported, contraction of CDI was correlated with prior exposure to antibiotics and/or health facilitates and two-thirds of our survey respondents experienced at least one other GI condition. This population might be more likely to visit health facilities than the general public, thereby increasing their risk for infection with <italic>C. difficile</italic>.</p><p>Time to diagnosis is critical for fast and effective treatment; however, only a minority of respondents received their diagnosis within 7 days after symptom onset. A similar-sized group experienced complete resolution of symptoms within 7 days after starting treatment. Our sample size was too small to stratify treatment success based on time to diagnosis.</p><p>We identified a long-lasting impact of CDI and we found overlapping and different themes as described by Madeo and Boyack.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Clearly, the acute impact of CDI on patient&#x02019;s lives is related to the severity of symptoms which bring upon physical suffering and precluded patients from participating in their daily activities. As CDI is a GI condition with symptoms such as severe diarrhea, patients are concerned with their privacy and dignity. Several patients experienced poor attitudes of hospital staff related to their bowel issues and highlighted a need for improved patient-staff communication.</p><p>Finally, we identified a lack of education. Patients indicated the need for understanding the illness and its potential impact on their future lives. Greater awareness among hospital staff and adherence to cleaning protocols could potentially reduce future infections with <italic>C. difficile</italic>. Several patients observed poor hygiene and cleaning in their respective health-care settings. Additionally, as many patients experienced slow diagnosis and referral to a specialist, which translated to a delay in treatment commencement, we see a need for education of physicians to correctly identify the symptoms. We saw several comments on misdiagnosis of CDI for anxiety during ER visits which could be addressed through communication and education strategies within hospitals across Canada.</p><p>Our data clearly indicate a need for further standardizing prevention and control practices across Canada. Reducing infection rates and curbing the spread of CDI would benefit the patient&#x02019;s lives and ultimately reduce the cost of CDI to the Canadian economy.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Ethics Approval and Informed Consent</title><p>The original survey was hosted through the GI Society as quality control for their ongoing programming.
