However, studying the specific role of <italic>BECN1</italic> at the genetic level is complicated due to its genomic proximity to <italic>BRCA1</italic> on both human (chromosome 17) and murine (chromosome 11) genomes. In human breast and ovarian cancers, the monoallelic deletion of these genes is often co-occurring. To investigate the potential tumor suppressor roles of two of the most commonly deleted autophagy genes in ovarian cancer, <italic>BECN1</italic> and <italic>MAP1LC3B</italic> were knocked-down in atypical (<italic>BECN1</italic>+/+ and <italic>MAP1LC3B</italic>+/+) ovarian cancer cells. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry metabolomics revealed reduced levels of acetyl-CoA which corresponded with elevated levels of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Migration rates of ovarian cancer cells were increased upon autophagy gene knockdown. Genomic instability was increased, resulting in copy-number alteration patterns which mimicked high grade serous ovarian cancer. We further investigated the causal role of <italic>Becn1</italic> haploinsufficiency for oncogenesis in a MISIIR SV40 large T antigen driven spontaneous ovarian cancer mouse model. Tumors were evident earlier among the <italic>Becn1</italic>+/- mice, and this correlated with an increase in copy-number alterations per chromosome in the <italic>Becn1</italic>+/- tumors. The results support monoallelic loss of <italic>BECN1</italic> as permissive for tumor initiation and potentiating for genomic instability in ovarian cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Life requires an excellent trash and recycling system. One system mammalian cells rely upon is called autophagy. Autophagy clears cells of larger forms of debris and is critical for normal cell function. We previously found that ovarian cancer cells are unable to execute normal cellular recycling during periods of stress, due to losses in core autophagy genes. Since autophagy has previously been implicated as a cancer cell survival factor, we directly investigated the impact of autophagy gene loss in ovarian cancer models. We discovered a reduction in autophagy proteins disabled normal genome quality control during cell division, leading to genomic instability. We document here for the first time whether reducing an autophagy gene in mice influences ovarian tumor formation. We found earlier ovarian tumors in autophagy deficient mice compared with control mice. We conclude that serous ovarian carcinomas, which rank among the most genetically altered cancers, gain their hallmark genomic instability in part by losing autophagy genes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA207729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8978-5961</contrib-id><name><surname>Delaney</surname><given-names>Joe R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA107263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stupack</surname><given-names>Dwayne G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA102310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlaepfer</surname><given-names>David D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA177519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8098-9888</contrib-id><name><surname>Harismendy</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG033082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>La Spada</surname><given-names>Albert R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Nine Girls Ask</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8978-5961</contrib-id><name><surname>Delaney</surname><given-names>Joe R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA138313</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK063491</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award009"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA023100</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award010"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM132055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0914-2967</contrib-id><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Christian M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIH grants CA207729 (JD), GM132055 (CJ), CA107263 (DGS), CA177519 (OH), CA102310 (DS), AG033082 (ALS), and by funding from the non-profit Nine Girls Ask Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ninegirlsask.com/">https://www.ninegirlsask.com/</ext-link>) (DGS, DS, JD).

The canonical cellular task of autophagy is to recycle damaged proteins, organelles, and fatty acids [<xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For protein quality control, autophagy is partially redundant and complementary to other cellular homeostasis pathways, such as the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Due to its central role in recycling metabolites, especially in hypoxic tumor environments, autophagy has been demonstrated to aid in tumor progression [<xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The role of autophagy as a tumor promoting cellular pathway is particularly evident in Ras- or Raf-driven tumors. Complete deletion of <italic>Atg7</italic>, an essential autophagy gene, dramatically slows tumor growth in these mouse models [<xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is in part due to depleted pools of glutamine and glutamate preventing nucleotide synthesis [<xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, autophagy has also been described as a tumor suppressor pathway.

Considering that completely compromising autophagic flux via homozygous deletion of autophagy genes can prevent tumor formation, it was unclear why tumors might arise while lacking so many autophagy alleles.

Unbiased hierarchical clustering of these CNAs separated shBECN1 and shLC3B from shScr controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008558.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The Euclidean distance of these CNAs, which is a measure of genetic drift, was higher between all autophagy-suppressed pairs than variation amongst the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008558.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The greater genetic drift between autophagy-suppressed samples was evident independent of normalization to the control.

To evaluate more subtle copy-number changes, we annotated the CNAs by chromosome location and base-pair length according to genotype. Subtle CNA variation was observed for shScr control SKOV3 cells across the genome for focal (&#x0003c;100kb) CNAs, but was rare for large (&#x0003e;1Mb) CNAs. There was a significant increase in both focal and large CNAs in shBECN1 cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008558.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). However, some chromosomes were more unstable than others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008558.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). <italic>LC3B</italic> knockdown exhibited similar disruption of both focal and large CNAs.

Deletions in chromosome arm 14p were shared across shLC3B cultures but not shBECN1 cultures, as were 15q deletions. In 3 of 4 shBECN1 cultures but only 1 of 4 shLC3B cultures, deletions within 21q were observed (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008558.s011">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>Common break sites lay within exceptionally long genes [<xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The patterns of CNA breaks and regions were checked for repetitive patterns and random effects. Since we identified an increase in intragenic dsDNA breaks in our SKOV3 autophagy-compromised cells, we wondered if the same pattern was observed. While very few previously identified genes were disrupted by CNA formation in our evolved SKOV3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008558.s011">S1 Table</xref>), we did observe a similar bias toward increased length, but not expression, in genes harboring genomic breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008558.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). To investigate whether this was significant, we performed a permutation analysis to determine if simply by having completely random CNAs of the same size as we observed in our samples, similar results would be found. In fact, randomized CNAs of equal length to the observed CNAs were observed more frequently on large genes relative to the actual distribution of gene sizes in the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008558.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). Therefore, our observations are not explained by genomic breaks which occur during the transcriptional regulation of long or active genes. To further evaluate the level of randomness, reduced segment CNAs were compared between shScr cells and autophagy gene knockdown cells. The ratio of single-sample unique CNAs to shared (potentially non-random, found in at least two samples) CNAs was found to be 1.5 in shScr isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008558.g004">Fig 4I</xref>), while in shBECN1 this ratio was 3.1 (Fisher&#x02019;s exact <italic>P &#x0003c;</italic> 3.8 x 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) and 3.5 in shLC3B (<italic>P &#x0003c;</italic> 2.5 x 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). Randomness was not different between shBECN1 and shLC3B cultures (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.42). Thus, while there are more overall shared segments within autophagy gene knockdown cells, there is an even greater increase in randomly changed CNAs.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Pathway analysis of CNAs</title><p>To determine patterns that were consistently altered in the shBECN1 and shLC3B cells compared to controls, we used two pathway analysis tools: HAPTRIG [<xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and GSEA [<xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. GSEA is a commonly used tool to measure curated sets of genes which are altered at statistically improbable rates, whereas HAPTRIG further incorporates interaction and haploinsufficiency data to generate pathway network scores, outperforming GSEA at identification of tumor suppressors and oncogenes using cancer CNA data [<xref rid="pgen.1008558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, KEGG pathway sets were used, since KEGG is one of the few pathway sets containing &#x0201c;autophagy&#x0201d; as a discrete pathway. We have reasoned that if the suppression of autophagy confers an adaptive selection event, individual gene deletion may not be as important as the ultimate functional impact on the autophagy pathway. Indeed, among patients the genes deleted within the autophagy pathway vary widely from tumor to tumor.</p><p>Similar to how tumor data is analyzed, results from shBECN1 and shLC3B knockdown cultures were pooled as a cohort (&#x0201c;shAUTO&#x0201d;) and compared to shScr control cultures. HAPTRIG analysis identified 29 differentially altered pathways in shBECN1/shLC3B cultures relative to shScr, at a significance of <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 as appropriate to the small sample size. Notably, many of the differentially altered pathways in SKOV3 shAUTO cells were altered concordant with that observed human ovarian tumors studied by the TCGA (filled circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008558.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Fanconi-anemia, RNA degradation, regulators of NOTCH signaling, and TNF signaling were all allelically suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008558.g005">Fig 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008558.s011">S1 Table</xref>).

HAPTRIG was used to tabulate which genes contribute the most to pathway alterations. Many of the same gene CNA hubs in human ovarian tumor networks are marked as hubs in the autophagy deficient cohort (shAUTO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008558.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that moderate suppression of single autophagy genes can result in a strikingly altered genotype.
