This study aims to determine the association between DPs before and during pregnancy and risk of GDM in Malaysian pregnant women. DPs were derived using principal component analysis of consumed 126 food and beverage items assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire collecting data retrospectively for pre-pregnancy, but prospectively for the first and second trimester. Three different DPs were identified at each time point and labelled as DP 1&#x02013;3 (pre-pregnancy), DP 4&#x02013;6 (first trimester), and DP 7&#x02013;9 (second trimester). About 10.6% (n = 48) of pregnant women were diagnosed with GDM in our cohort. Women with high adherence (HA) to DP 2 (adjusted OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.20&#x02013;0.91) and DP 5 (adjusted OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.11&#x02013;0.68) showed a significantly reduced risk of GDM compared to women with low adherence (LA). Other DPs were not significantly associated with GDM risk. Compared to women with GDM, non-GDM women showed HA scores for all DPs throughout pregnancy. Overall, a relative low percentage of women with GDM was found in this cohort. The risk was lower in women with HA to a relatively unhealthy dietary pattern, i.e. DP 2 and DP 5. The lower body mass index (BMI) status and energy intake of women showing a HA to DP 2 in the first trimester may underlie the observed association with a lower GDM risk. Additionally, genetic variance might explain the less susceptibility to GDM despite HA to unhealthy DPs among non-GDM women.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Danone Dumex (M) Shd Bhd</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohd Shariff</surname><given-names>Zalilah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>SECOST was supported by a research grant from Danone Dumex (Malaysia) Shd.

In 2017, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that 20.9 million (16.2%) of live births were affected by hyperglycemia in pregnancy, and about 85.1% of these live births were due to GDM [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The National Health and Morbidity Survey (2016) reported that the prevalence of GDM among Malaysian mothers aged 15&#x02013;49 years old was 13.5% [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Dietary pattern is a relatively new approach that describes a combination of commonly consumed foods [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that allows for the diet to be described as a whole [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nutritional health outcomes are often the result of multiple synergies among nutrients and foods rather than just the sum of the individual food [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although there are several approaches to identifying dietary patterns of pregnant women, the posterior-approach derived from principal component analysis (PCA) is the most commonly used for deriving dietary patterns during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Numerous studies examining the role of PCA derived DPs in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as GDM, pre-eclampsia, and pre-term birth [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have been published.</p><p>Associations between DP before and during pregnancy with risk of GDM has been examined [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Most studies showed that an adoption of the prudent pattern, diet that was rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes showed significant lower risk of GDM [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], whereas adhering to the Western pattern, which is characterized by high intakes of red meat, processed meats and refined foods, was associated with increased risk of GDM [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There are several suggested mechanisms by which Western pattern may increase the risk of GDM through inflammation, and placental dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Despite the numerous studies on the association between DPs and risk of GDM, findings are mostly inconsistent. These inconsistencies could be due to different study designs and diagnostic criteria of GDM, methods to measure dietary intake (e.g. diet recall, diet record, food frequency questionnaire), and socio-demographic factors (e.g. age, ethnicity, and BMI). It could also be attributed to the different food items reported for the respective DPs. For example, the &#x0201c;prudent&#x0201d; DP, which is a diet delivers health benefits, observed in a prospective cohort study of women in Northern China was characterized by higher intakes of dark-colored vegetables and deep-sea fish [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], while the &#x0201c;prudent&#x0201d; DP of women in the Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study (BIGCS) was predominantly dairy products, nuts, eggs, fish, soups, and fruits [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies on DPs and GDM have focused on assessment of such relationship at a single time point, either pre-pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or during pregnancy, before diagnosis of GDM [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

As there are considerable differences in diet and lifestyle behaviors, the DPs of Malaysian pregnant women could be different from those reported in Western as well as other Asian populations. Most people eat a combination of healthy and less healthy foods, but the impact of mixed dietary patterns on the risk of GDM remains unknown. Thus, the objectives of this prospective study are to describe the DPs before and during pregnancy in a sample of Malaysian pregnant women and to determine the association between DPs and the risk of GDM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design and location</title><p>The SECOST (Seremban Cohort Study) project is an on-going prospective study in which pregnant women are followed-up up to 1 year postpartum, and their infants are followed-up every 6 months until 2 years old.

PCA was performed separately for each time point and the factors were rotated by an orthogonal transformation (varimax rotation) to maintain uncorrelated factors and greater interpretability. The number of factors was determined by eigen values greater than 1.5 [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The data suitability was assessed before performing PCA. Inspection of the correlation matrix on the food groups revealed the presence of several correlation coefficients of 0.2 and above.

The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was used to ensure that the sample size was adequate for these analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Oklin values were 0.68 (pre-pregnancy), 0.71 (first trimester), and 0.65 (second trimester). Three characteristic DPs were identified at each time point and labelled as DP 1&#x02013;3 (pre-pregnancy), DP 4&#x02013;6 (first trimester), and DP 7&#x02013;9 (second trimester). The factor scores for each DP and for each individual were calculated by summing the food item intakes weighted by their factor loadings [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The factor score was then categorized into tertiles (1st tertile = low adherence (LA), 2nd tertile = moderate adherence (MA), and 3<sup>rd</sup> tertile = high adherence (HA)) for ease of interpretation in the subsequent analysis. More detailed description of DPs before and during pregnancy was published elsewhere (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.4162/nrp.2019.13.3.230">10.4162/nrp.2019.13.3.230</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)</title><p>Women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM) (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &#x0003e;7.0 mmol/l), or abnormal glycaemia (FPG &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/l or FPG &#x0003e;6.0 mmol/l) at study enrolment were excluded.

Basic descriptive statistics were generated such as means and standard deviations for the continuous variables, while for categorical variables, frequency, and percentage distribution. Chi-square test of independence or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and Independent t-test were used to assess the association between women characteristics with risk of GDM, respectively for continuous and categorical variables.</p><p>Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was performed to assess the association between tertile of adherence to DPs and the risk of GDM, with MCH clinics and gestational week at OGTT as random effects.

The lowest tertile of adherence was set as the reference group. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between DPs and GDM were presented. A further stratified analysis was performed to determine the associations between DP 2 and DP 5 with GDM by pre-pregnancy BMI. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to plot the DP trajectory for GDM and non-GDM groups. Three major patterns were identified at each time point: pattern 1 (DP 1, DP 4, and DP 7), pattern 2 (DP 2, DP 5, and DP 8), and pattern 3 (DP 3, DP 6 and DP 9).

During pre-pregnancy, a similar trend was observed for all DPs, in which women with HA were at reduced risk of GDM. In the first trimester, women with HA to DP 4 and DP 5 were at reduced risk of GDM, and this trend remained similar in the second trimester (DP 7 and DP 8). Meanwhile, women with HA to DP 6 were at higher risk of GDM in the first trimester, but they were at lower risk for GDM in the second trimester (DP 9). The associations between adherence to a DP and the risk of GDM were generally not significant, except for DP 2 and DP 5, e.g. women with HA to DP 2 (adjusted OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.20&#x02013;0.91) and DP 5 (adjusted OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.11&#x02013;0.68) had significantly reduced risk of GDM compared to women with LA. The findings of the stratified analysis showed that the significant association between DP 5 and GDM was only observed among underweight or normal-weight women. Meanwhile, a significant association between DP 2 and GDM risk was found only among obese women (<xref rid="pone.0227246.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0227246.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227246.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Adjusted odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between dietary pattern and GDM (N = 452).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0227246.t003g" xlink:href="pone.0227246.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Dietary pattern<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t003fn003">

The number of women with GDM (n = 48) were relatively small. There were significant differences in pattern 1, 2 and 3 between non-GDM and GDM women. While non-GDM women maintained high adherence to all three DPs before and during pregnancy, GDM women changed their diets during pregnancy. For pattern 1 (DP 1, DP 4 and DP 7 &#x02013;prudent diet, high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, eggs, milk and dairy), GDM women had low DP score before pregnancy, decreased score at the first trimester and further decreased score at second trimester.

For pattern 3 (DP 3, DP 6 and DP 9 &#x02013;high protein, sugar and energy), GDM women showed an inverse V-shaped trend in that they had low DP score before pregnancy, the highest DP score at the first trimester and the lowest DP score at the second trimester.</p><fig id="pone.0227246.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227246.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>DP trajectory before and during pregnancy by maternal glycemia adjusted for pre-pregnancy BMI and rate of gestational weight gain.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0227246.g002"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this prospective cohort of 452 pregnant women, three major DPs were identified before and during pregnancy. Only DP 2 and DP 5 showed significantly a lower risk of GDM after the adjustment for covariates. The study findings should be interpreted with caution as this pattern was relatively higher in loadings for sugar, spread &#x00026; creamer, sauces, condiments &#x00026; spices, and oils &#x00026; fats. The percentage of under-reporting was 25.9&#x02013;31.2%, calculated using the Goldberg method (rEI:BMR) with implausible reporters had rEI:BMR values that differed from physical activity levels by more than &#x000b1; 2 standard deviations [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The food items observed in this pattern were mainly cooking ingredients or additions to food items consumed at main meals or snacks. However, it can be referred to as the common food pattern, as these foods are commonly consumed by the Malaysian population. This DP has not been previously identified in the Western dietary pattern [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] but was similar to the &#x02018;less-healthy&#x02019; pattern (condiments, sugar, oils and fats, sweets and desserts, and tea and coffee) reported by pregnant women in Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Birth Cohort [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, this pattern is believed to be the true DP of our study population. The finding also reflects specific differences in dietary patterns between the Malaysia and Western population.</p><p>Generally, women with diets high in sugar and fat show a higher risk of GDM [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Yet, this study showed that women with HA to DP 2 (characterized as high sugar and fat) in pre-pregnancy and DP 5 in the first trimester were in fact significantly at reduced risk of GDM compared to women with LA to such a relatively unhealthy diet. Subsequently, a stratified analysis was performed to determine the associations between DP 2 and DP 5 with GDM by pre-pregnancy BMI (<xref rid="pone.0227246.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This analysis showed that the significant association between DP 5 and GDM was only observed among underweight or normal weight women. Meanwhile, a significant association between DP 2 and GDM risk was found only among obese women. In addition, the present study also found that among women with HA to DP 5, underweight or normal weight women had significantly lower total energy intake in the first trimester (1,541 kcal/day) than overweight or obese women (1,624 kcal/day) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227246.s002">S2 Table</xref>). The mean total energy intake was also below the requirement for pregnant women in first trimester (1,690 kcal/day) [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Based on these data we speculate that the lower total energy intake observed in women with this dietary pattern might be protective of insulin resistance and consequently hyperglycemia risk. Thus, a lower BMI status and energy intake of women with high HA to DP 5 may underlie the observed association with a lower GDM risk. We cannot examine the association between pre-pregnancy energy intake and DP 2 with risk of GDM as the pre-pregnancy energy intake cannot be assessed retrospectively. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to confirm the observed associations for underweight or normal weight women and for overweight or obese women and understand the drivers for GDM risk.</p><p>The findings from the ANOVA repeated measures showed that non-GDM women tend to have consistently higher DP scores for all three patterns before pregnancy up to the second trimester while GDM women showed lower and/or inconsistent DP scores from pre-pregnancy up to the second trimester of pregnancy. These trends in DP scores were similar regardless of adjustments for covariates like gestational weight gain and pre-pregnancy BMI. Pattern 2 and pattern 3 can be considered as the &#x0201c;less healthy&#x0201d; patterns due to their higher energy, fat, and sugar content. Yet, pattern 2 represents the typical Malaysian DP in which additional cooking oils, condiments and sugary substances are used to prepare standard fresh food items. Previous studies have shown that genetic factors are important in determining susceptibility to GDM [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Inherited abnormalities of pancreatic islet &#x003b2;-cell function and/ or &#x003b2;-cell mass may be implicated in the etiology of GDM [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible that non-GDM women in the present study have genetic variants that make them less susceptible to the risk of GDM and can explain why they are not at risk of GDM despite having also high DP scores for less healthy DPs. In general, the percentage of women that developed GDM in this cohort was low, also compared to the reported prevalence of GDM in Malaysia [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This may indicate that the SECOST study was conducted among a relatively traditional and healthy population. Further study is needed to identify the factors including genetic that explain susceptibility for GDM and examine the associations between genes, DPs, and BMI with the risk of GDM.</p><p>Similar to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the present study supported that only DPs in the first trimester and before pregnancy were significantly associated with the risk of GDM. Maternal metabolism in early pregnancy is critical not only for maternal health but also gestational programming [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. During the first few weeks of pregnancy, the presence of placenta causes a reduction in growth hormone levels, resulting in enhanced insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. GDM occurs if &#x003b2;-cells are unable to compensate for the changes in insulin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In another word, women are exposed to metabolic dysregulation in early pregnancy, and this metabolic abnormality may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Oostvogels et al. (2017) showed that pre-pregnancy maternal weight status and early pregnancy maternal lipid profile are independently associated with offspring adiposity [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which reinforces the important role of maternal metabolism before and in early pregnancy. The precise underlying mechanisms between pre-pregnancy and early pregnancy DPs with the risk of GDM, however, remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, the available evidence seems to support that women planning for pregnancy or in early pregnancy should be the target of lifestyle intervention for preventing GDM [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>This study is not without any limitation. The results of the PCA approach might be affected by several arbitrary decisions such as determination of a number of factors to extract, the components labeling, the method of rotation, and even their interpretation [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this study, the total variance of 3 patterns explained in each time point is relatively low (&#x0003c;40%). However, this finding was comparable with other previous studies that reported a total variance of 16.6&#x02013;32.9% [<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227246.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Besides, there is also the possibility of recall bias and misreporting when using SFFQ for dietary assessment. Nevertheless, the use of well-trained enumerators in data collection could reduce these errors. Although the effects of potential covariates were adjusted in the statistical methods, residual confounding of unknown confounders cannot be excluded. Besides, nutrition knowledge for study population is unknown. Future studies could include extending confounders to the model as well as to determine the nutrition knowledge of pregnant women. Despite these limitations, the present study is worthwhile as it provides important insights into the association between DPs before and during pregnancy and the risk of GDM, which such information is lacking in the literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study found that diets rich in sugar, spread and creamer, spices and condiments (DP 2 and DP 5) were significantly associated with reduced risk of GDM. The unexpected findings could be due to factors such as, lower BMI, and reduced energy intake. Furthermore, non-GDM women maintained a high DP score for all DPs from pre-pregnancy until second trimester of pregnancy, meanwhile GDM women showed lower and/or inconsistent DP scores, suggesting that non-GDM might have a lower genetic susceptibility to GDM as they are not at risk of GDM despite having also high DP scores for less healthy DPs (pattern 2 and pattern 3). A future large-scale prospective study or a well-designed randomized controlled trial is warranted to further confirm the association between the dietary pattern and the GDM in the Malaysian population. Such findings could inform efforts to strengthen existing or develop appropriate health and nutrition strategies to address the increasing rate of GDM in Malaysia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec011"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227246.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Adjusted odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals for dietary pattern 2 and GDM (n = 452) [Sensitivity analysis].</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227246.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227246.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Energy intake in first trimester of women by pre-pregnancy BMI.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227246.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are extremely grateful to all the women who took part in this study, the medical officers and nurses for their assistance during data collection, and the whole SECOST team, which includes interviewers, research assistants, and volunteers.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227246.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">IDF.

</p><p>PONE-D-19-22261</p><p>The association between dietary patterns before and in early pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM): data from the Malaysian SECOST cohort</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr Yong,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>&#x02022; The justification for using the Principal Component Analysis is not clear because it is possible to&#x000a0;assess the relationship between frequency of consumption of specific food groups (e.g. 17 food groups mentioned in the article) and risk of Gestational Diabetes Miletus (GDM) directely without extracting hidden DPs. The identification of hidden dietary patterns (principal factors/components) through the PCA simply complicated the interpretation of the findings.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors presented&#x000a0;conflicting findings about the significance of diet and dietary pattern for GDM. At some point they stated that DP2 and DP5 generated by PCA are significant predictors of GDM while latter they argued that&#x000a0;dietary pattern as assessed by FFQ has no association with GDM.&#x000a0;</p><p>&#x02022; In the abstract it is stated that &#x0201c;Our FFQ analysis did not reveal any clear associations between (pre)pregnancy dietary patterns and the risk to develop GDM (or not) &#x02026;..&#x0201d; however in the results section, no result is provided regarding the direct association between frequency of consumption of food groups and risk of GDM. </p><p>I recommend the authors to focus on the relationship between frequency of consumption of specific food groups (as measured by FFQ) and occurrence of GDM. Kind of multivariable analyses for assessing the association between the 17 food groups and GDM may provide practically meaningful findings.</p><p>&#x02022; Table 3 presents the results of three different models. I recommend the authors to make interpretation based on one model which they consider as the best.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors did not satisfactorily explain how DPs relatively higher in loadings for sugar, spread &#x00026; creamer, sauces, condiments &#x00026; spices, and oils &#x00026; fats are associated with reduced risk of GDM. In the discussion section, they mentioned that the significant association was only observed among underweight and normal weight women; however the results of this stratified analysis had not been present in the results section.</p><p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Nov 02 2019 11:59PM.

These sentences are not clear, please revisit them.</p><p>&#x02022; &#x0201c;Three major patterns were identified before and during pregnancy: pattern 1 consisted of DP 1, DP 4, and DP 7, pattern 2 consisted of DP 2, DP 5, and DP 8, and pattern 3 included DP 3, DP 6 and DP 9.&#x0201d; The sentence is not clear.</p><p>Results</p><p>&#x02022; Table 1: What was the justification for using age of 30 as a cut-off here? Use of 35 years as a cut-off would be practically meaningful b/c the risk of many obstetric complications tends to increase after the age of 35 years. Similarly, the cutoffs used for classifying height has not been justified.</p><p>&#x02022; Table 1: STPM/ Matric???

It is not clear how you decided to extract three components at each round. Did you evaluate the scree plot or decide take all the components having Eigenvalues above 1? Or did you simply take the first three components with the highest Eigenvalues?</p><p>&#x02022; Table 2: the combined total variance explained by the three principal components is relatively low (&#x0003c;40%) in all of the three rounds (pre-pregnancy, first trimester and second trimester). It is usually recommended that at least 60% of the variance should be explained by the extracted components. Do you think that the PCA has adequately explained the original 17 food groups?</p><p>&#x02022; I could not get the results of the &#x0201c;sensitivity analysis&#x0201d; mentioned in the methods section.</p><p>&#x02022; Line 259-271: the paragraph is not clear.

The findings suggest that an unhealthy diet is protective against the development of gestational diabetes in a Malaysian population. The work is overall well conducted and well put together but the conclusions need further explanation and discussion in order to reconcile the findings.</p><p>Women eating DP 2 and 5 had a diet rich in sugar, spread and creamer, spices and condiments, but this is unlikely to account for all calories. It would be helpful to know if these women were eating much else besides? Perhaps a 'typical day' idea of what this diet looked like would be useful. It would also be helpful to know what exactly the number of calories were for each group. If this group was eating only small amounts of other food stuffs then it is possible the calorie amount was very different.</p><p>What %carbohydrate was seen in each group? Is there information on dietary macronutrients? It is also possible that the difference in carb or fat content also drives this association.</p><p>I personally would urge caution in interpreting these findings and would suggest that the relevance of this to public health remains unclear. This is not reason to reject this paper, but there is a risk the findings could be misinterpreted.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Response to the decision letter</p><p>We are grateful to the editor and reviewers for their constructive comments on our manuscript. We have addressed all comments and suggestions accordingly and submitted a revised version of the manuscript for further consideration by the journal. Specifically, we have provided point-by-point response to comments / suggestion put forth by the editor and reviewers.</p><p>1. The justification for using the Principal Component Analysis is not clear because it is possible to assess the relationship between frequency of consumption of specific food groups (e.g. 17 food groups mentioned in the article) and risk of Gestational Diabetes Miletus (GDM) directly without extracting hidden DPs. The identification of hidden dietary patterns (principal factors/components) through the PCA simply complicated the interpretation of the findings.</p><p>Response:</p><p>A paragraph to justify the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify dietary patterns has been included in the introductory section (Line 69-81, text in red). </p><p>&#x0201c;Dietary intake during pregnancy is commonly assessed through the intakes of energy, macronutrients, micronutrients or food groups [12,13], which may then be examined in relation to an imbalanced maternal diet and poor maternal nutritional status. Dietary pattern is a relatively new approach that describes a combination of commonly consumed foods [14] that allows for the diet to be described as a whole [15]. Nutritional health outcomes are often the result of multiple synergies among nutrients and foods rather than just the sum of the individual food [16]. Although there are several approaches to identifying dietary patterns of pregnant women, the posterior-approach derived from principal component analysis (PCA) is the most commonly used for deriving dietary patterns during pregnancy [10-12]. PCA is a technique to reduce a large of correlated variables into a smaller number of components [21,22], revealing the underlying structure within diets of the population. Numerous studies examining the role of PCA derived DPs in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as GDM, pre-eclampsia, and pre-term birth [23&#x02013;25] have been published.&#x0201d;</p><p>2. The authors presented conflicting findings about the significance of diet and dietary pattern for GDM. At some point they stated that DP2 and DP5 generated by PCA are significant predictors of GDM while latter they argued that dietary pattern as assessed by FFQ has no association with GDM. </p><p>Response:</p><p>The association between dietary pattern and GDM was examined using logistic regression. Three models were examined. The first model adjusts for clinic and gestational week at OGTT. Model 2 adjusts for covariates of model 1 plus maternal age, and ethnicity. Model 3 then adjusts for covariates in model 2, plus income, pre-pregnancy BMI, medical history of GDM and family history of DM. This study found a significant association between DP and GDM in model 1 and model 2. However, after adjusting for covariates in model 3, the association becomes non-significant. The models are intended to portray the influence of different types of covariates (model 1 &#x02013; clinic factors; model 2 &#x02013; biological factors; model 3 &#x02013; familial / environmental factors) on the association between DP and GDM. However, as suggested by reviewer, we will only retain 1 model, but which include the following covariates &#x02013; clinic + biological factors + family history of DM + previous GDM.</p><p>3. In the abstract it is stated that &#x0201c;Our FFQ analysis did not reveal any clear associations between (pre)pregnancy dietary patterns and the risk to develop GDM (or not) &#x02026;..&#x0201d; however in the results section, no result is provided regarding the direct association between frequency of consumption of food groups and risk of GDM.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised the conclusion of the abstract accordingly (Line 47-53, text in red). </p><p>Abstract</p><p>Overall, a relative low percentage of women with GDM was found in this cohort. The risk was lower in women with high adherence to a relatively unhealthy dietary pattern, i.e. DP 2 and DP 5. The lower body mass index (BMI) status and energy intake of women showing a high adherence to DP 2 in the first trimester may underlie the observed association with a lower GDM risk. Additionally, genetic variance might explain the less susceptibility to GDM despite HA to unhealthy DPs among non-GDM women. </p><p>4. I recommend the authors to focus on the relationship between frequency of consumption of specific food groups (as measured by FFQ) and occurrence of GDM. Kind of multivariable analyses for assessing the association between the 17 food groups and GDM may provide practically meaningful findings.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We would like to retain the dietary pattern analysis as to emphasize the importance of food / nutrient interaction that represents usual diet. A paragraph to justify the usage of dietary pattern has been included in the Introduction section (refer to Response 1). </p><p>5. Table 3 presents the results of three different models. I recommend the authors to make interpretation based on one model which they consider as the best.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised Table 3 accordingly. </p><p>6. The authors did not satisfactorily explain how DPs relatively higher in loadings for sugar, spread &#x00026; creamer, sauces, condiments &#x00026; spices, and oils &#x00026; fats are associated with reduced risk of GDM. In the discussion section, they mentioned that the significant association was only observed among underweight and normal weight women; however, the results of this stratified analysis had not been present in the results section.</p><p>Response:</p><p>A lower BMI status and energy intake of women with high HA to DP 5 may underlie the observed association with a lower GDM risk. The findings of the stratified analysis have been included in the methods and results section. Please refer to Table 4 for the stratified analysis. </p><p>Methods:</p><p>A stratified analysis was performed to determine the associations between DP 2 and DP 5 with GDM by pre-pregnancy BMI (Table 4).</p><p>Results:</p><p>The findings of the stratified analysis showed that the significant association between DP 5 and GDM was only observed among underweight or normal-weight women. Meanwhile, a significant association between DP 2 and GDM risk was found only among obese women.</p><p>Background</p><p>1. Please provide clear definitions for dietary pattern and &#x0201c;prudent diet&#x0201d;.</p><p>Response:</p><p>The definitions for the two terms have been incorporated:</p><p>Dietary pattern &#x02013; (Line 72-73, text in red)</p><p>Prudent dietary pattern &#x02013; (Line 96-100, text in red)</p><p>2.

For example, the &#x0201c;prudent&#x0201d; DP in a prospective cohort study of women in Northern China was characterized by higher intakes of dark-coloured vegetables and deep-sea fish [12], whereas the &#x0201c;prudent&#x0201d; DP of women in the Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study (BIGCS) was predominantly dairy products, nuts, eggs, fish, soups, and fruits [13].</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised the sentences. (Line 96-100, text in red)</p><p>It could also be attributed to the different food items reported for the respective DPs. For example, the &#x0201c;prudent&#x0201d; DP, which is a diet delivers health benefits, observed in a prospective cohort study of women in Northern China was characterized by higher intakes of dark-colored vegetables and deep-sea fish [26], while the &#x0201c;prudent&#x0201d; DP of women in the Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study (BIGCS) was predominantly dairy products, nuts, eggs, fish, soups, and fruits [27]. </p><p>2. The background section should give a highlight of what other studies conducted in Western or Asian population have found about the relationship between dietary pattern and GDM.</p><p>Response:</p><p>A paragraph on the relationship between dietary pattern and GDM has been included in the Introduction section. (line 83-89, text in red)</p><p>Associations between DP before and during pregnancy with risk of GDM has been examined [26&#x02013;30]. Most studies showed that an adoption of the prudent pattern, diet that was rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes showed significant lower risk of GDM [26&#x02013;28], whereas adhering to the Western pattern, which is characterized by high intakes of red meat, processed meats and refined foods, was associated with increased risk of GDM [23,26,31]. There are several suggested mechanisms by which Western pattern may increase the risk of GDM through inflammation, and placental dysfunction [26,29,30].</p><p>Methods</p><p>3. Please comment on the adequacy of the sample size (power) for addressing the research questions at hand.</p><p>Response:</p><p>The adequacy of the sample size of pregnant women was checked to ensure a 5% statistical significance level and 80% power. (Line 126-128, text in red) </p><p>For PCA analysis, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was used to ensure that the sample size was adequate for these analyses. The Kaiser-Meyer-Oklin values were 0.68 (pre-pregnancy), 0.71 (first trimester), and 0.65 (second trimester). (line 160-163, text in red)</p><p>4. Line 184: please provide additional information on how the sensitivity analysis was made.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised the sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analyses were run between acceptable reporters and under-reporters of energy intake. Parity and total energy intake have been taken out from the sensitivity analysis model, as parity was not significant associated with GDM risk. For energy intake, the relationships between DP and GDM are likely to be at least partially mediated by total energy intake. As energy intake is likely to be on the causal pathway between dietary variables and the outcome of interest, it may be inappropriate to adjust for total energy when modelling DPs and GDM. However, we have to some degree, accounted for total energy intakes by identifying the dietary patterns: a higher z-score for the observed dietary pattern indicates that an individual has a high intake of food relevant to the specific dietary pattern. </p><p>5. Line 188-91: not clear. Please revisit it.</p><p>Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were presented. Potential covariates included in the multivariable model were age (continuous), ethnicity (Malays/ Non-Malays), household income (continuous), pre-pre-pregnancy BMI (continuous), history of GDM (yes or no), and family history of DM (yes or no). In sensitivity analyses, additional adjustment for parity (yes or no), energy intake at that trimester (continuous), and omitting under-reporters (yes or no) was investigated. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to plot the DP trajectory with similar pattern by maternal glycemia categories. Three major patterns were identified before and during pregnancy: pattern 1 consisted of DP 1, DP 4, and DP 7, pattern 2 consisted of DP 2, DP 5, and DP 8, and pattern 3 included DP 3, DP 6 and DP 9. Significant level of the statistical analysis was set at the cut-off point of p&#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised lines 188-91 accordingly. (Line 211-219, text in red)</p><p>Adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between DPs and GDM were presented. A further stratified analysis was performed to determine the associations between DP 2 and DP 5 with GDM by pre-pregnancy BMI (Table 4). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to plot the DP trajectory for GDM and non-GDM groups. Three major patterns were identified at each time point: pattern 1 (DP 1, DP 4, and DP 7), pattern 2 (DP 2, DP 5, and DP 8), and pattern 3 (DP 3, DP 6 and DP 9). Sensitivity analyses were run between acceptable reporters and under-reporters of energy intake. The findings did not change the main findings (S1 Table). The cut off point for statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>6.

Table 1: What was the justification for using age of 30 as a cut-off here? Use of 35 years as a cut-off would be practically meaningful b/c the risk of many obstetric complications tends to increase after the age of 35 years. Similarly, the cutoffs used for classifying height has not been justified.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised the age group to 35 years. The classification of height was based on the tertile of height. </p><p>9.Table 1: STPM/ Matric??? Not clear</p><p>Response:</p><p>STPM refers to the Malaysian Higher School Certificate and Matric refers to Matriculation. </p><p>Footnote has been added for the abbreviation of STPM/Matriculation (Table 1).</p><p>10. If the information was collected during pregnancy, how did you manage to calculate pre-pregnancy BMI?</p><p>Response:</p><p>Women were requested to recall pre-pregnancy body weight. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) was calculated as pre-pregnancy weight divided by the square of height and classified according to the recommendation of World Health Organization [14]. (Line 191-194, text in red)</p><p>11. Line 214-15: &#x0201c;Three specific DPs were observed at each time period before and during pregnancy&#x0201d;. It is not clear how you decided to extract three components at each round. Did you evaluate the scree plot or decide take all the components having Eigenvalues above 1? Or did you simply take the first three components with the highest Eigenvalues?</p><p>Response:</p><p>The number of factors was determined by eigen values greater than 1.5 [15]. (line 156-157, text in red).</p><p>12. Table 2: the combined total variance explained by the three principal components is relatively low (&#x0003c;40%) in all of the three rounds (pre-pregnancy, first trimester and second trimester). It is usually recommended that at least 60% of the variance should be explained by the extracted components. Do you think that the PCA has adequately explained the original 17 food groups?</p><p>Response:</p><p>We agree that the total variance explained by the 3 patterns at each time point is relatively low. However, several studies that used PCA to derive DP during pregnancy reported a comparable percentage of total variance explained (&#x0003c;30%) % [23,27,31]. We believe that it is reasonable to expect a total variance of &#x0003c; 40% in this study. We have addressed this issue as a study limitation. </p><p>Limitation:</p><p>In this study, the total variance of 3 patterns explained in each time point is relatively low (&#x0003c;40%). However, this finding was comparable with other previous studies that reported a total variance of 16.6 &#x02013; 32.9% [23,27,31].</p><p>13. I could not get the results of the &#x0201c;sensitivity analysis&#x0201d; mentioned in the methods section.</p><p>Response:</p><p>The result of the sensitivity analysis has been added. (S1 Table)</p><p>14. Line 259-271: the paragraph is not clear. Please revisit it again.</p><p>Differences in DP trajectory from pre-pregnancy until the second trimester of pregnancy between non-GDM and GDM women are depicted in Fig 2. While non-GDM women maintained high adherence to all three DPs before and during pregnancy, GDM women clearly seemed to change their diets over the course of pregnancy. For pattern 1 (DP 1, DP 4 and DP 7 &#x02013; prudent diet, high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, eggs, milk and dairy), GDM positive women had low DP scores before pregnancy, decreased scores at the first trimester further decreasing at second trimester time point. For pattern 2 (DP 2, DP 5 and DP 8 &#x02013; high in condiments &#x00026; spices, and sugar, spread &#x00026; creamer), a V-shaped trend was observed in GDM women, where DP score was at the lowest point in the first trimester and higher at the second trimester. For pattern 3 (DP 3, DP 6 and DP 9 &#x02013; high protein, sugar and energy), GDM women showed an inverse V-shaped trend in that they had low DP score before pregnancy, the highest DP score at the first trimester and the lowest DP score at the second trimester.</p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised the paragraph accordingly.

The findings of the stratified analysis have been included in the methods and results section as below. </p><p>Thank you for asking me to review this interesting paper which has results contrary to expectations. The findings suggest that an unhealthy diet is protective against the development of gestational diabetes in a Malaysian population. The work is overall well conducted and well put together but the conclusions need further explanation and discussion in order to reconcile the findings. </p><p>Response:</p><p>We have revised the conclusion accordingly. (Line 404-415, text in red)</p><p>Conclusion: </p><p>The present study found that diets rich in sugar, spread and creamer, spices and condiments (DP 2 and DP 5) were significantly associated with reduced risk of GDM. The unexpected findings could be due to factors such as, lower BMI, and reduced energy intake. Furthermore, non-GDM women maintained a high DP score for all DPs from pre-pregnancy until second trimester of pregnancy, meanwhile GDM women showed lower and/or inconsistent DP scores, suggesting that non-GDM might have a lower genetic susceptibility to GDM as they are not at risk of GDM despite having also high DP scores for less healthy DPs (pattern 2 and pattern 3). A future large-scale prospective study or a well-designed randomized controlled trial is warranted to further confirm the association between the dietary pattern and the GDM in the Malaysian population. Such findings could inform efforts to strengthen existing or develop appropriate health and nutrition strategies to address the increasing rate of GDM in Malaysia.</p><p>Women eating DP 2 and 5 had a diet rich in sugar, spread and creamer, spices and condiments, but this is unlikely to account for all calories. It would be helpful to know if these women were eating much else besides? Perhaps a 'typical day' idea of what this diet looked like would be useful. </p><p>Response:</p><p>The detail of dietary pattern before and during pregnancy has been published elsewhere (DOI: 10.4162/nrp.2019.13.3.230). (Line 168-170, text in red)</p><p>It would also be helpful to know what exactly the number of calories were for each group. If this group was eating only small amounts of other food stuffs then it is possible the calorie amount was very different. What %carbohydrate was seen in each group? Is there information on dietary macronutrients? It is also possible that the difference in carb or fat content also drives this association.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Yes, we have run the analysis as indicated (energy and macronutrients with GDM). However, only total energy showed a significant association. Please refer to supplementary tables 2. </p><p>I personally would urge caution in interpreting these findings and would suggest that the relevance of this to public health remains unclear. This is not reason to reject this paper, but there is a risk the findings could be misinterpreted.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We have revised the manuscript accordingly. I hope the revised manuscript will meet the requirements of PlosOne. </p><p>The study findings should be interpreted with caution as this pattern was relatively higher in loadings for sugar, spread &#x00026; creamer, sauces, condiments &#x00026; spices, and oils &#x00026; fats.
