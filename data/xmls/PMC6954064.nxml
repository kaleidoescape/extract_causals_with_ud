The causal relationship between ZIKV and brain malformations was confirmed by in vitro studies showing that ZIKV exposure directly infects human neural progenitors (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>) and impairs the growth of three-dimensional differentiating cultures (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>) while altering genes (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>) and proteins related to cell cycle arrest (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). In vivo, vertical ZIKV transmission was modeled mainly by using immunocompromised mice, which are susceptible to this viral infection (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Severe reduction of brain size is considered the hallmark of what is now called the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), a collection of developmental malformations associated with ZIKV&#x02019;s congenital infection such as ventriculomegaly, calcifications, corpus callosum agenesis, lissencephaly, and retinal abnormalities (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>).</p><p>As with other STORCH (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, others, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus) pathogens, ZIKV infection during pregnancy leads to birth defects in some but not all affected mothers. Approximately 6 to 12% of infected pregnancies will result in CZS (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). The distribution of CZS in human populations, however, is asymmetrical (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). In Brazil, which has reported ~95% of all CZS cases (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>) and where ZIKV has severely affected multiple states, most occurrences of CZS (~75%) were found in the disadvantaged socioeconomic region of the Northeast (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Epidemiological surveys showed that, even within Northeastern communities, ZIKV-related microcephaly was most prevalent in those areas with the lowest socioeconomic status (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Hence, cofactors are likely to play a key role in modulating ZIKV infection&#x02019;s severity and the level of developmental impairment.</p><p>Malnutrition is considered one of the most critical causes of immunodeficiency worldwide (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>), as it can substantially increase a host&#x02019;s susceptibility to an infection and amplify pathogenesis severity (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). An insufficient intake of protein can be a form of undernutrition and is a widespread problem in low-income populations, which have limited access to more expensive food components (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>).</p><p>Here, by analyzing epidemiological data collected in Brazil from the ZIKV outbreak period, we found a significant prevalence of microcephaly in states where undernutrition is more frequent. To experimentally assess this correlation, we developed a mouse model using immunocompetent pregnant females, which were infected with ZIKV at the peak of embryonic neurogenesis and were exposed to protein restriction before and during gestation. Using this undernourished mouse model, we identified that there is robust and persistent ZIKV infection in the spleens of undernourished mothers, in contrast to controls. We also found severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth compromise in addition to the decline of embryonic neurogenesis and reduction in brain size of newborns. From RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we conclude that the significant differences in the regulation patterns of key pathways and particular genes identified within developing brains reflect how a poor nutritional status increases the adverse effects of ZIKV infection. Together, these data provide important new clues to understand the impact of environmental cofactors and, particularly, nutrition in the emergence of CZS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microcephaly during ZIKV Brazilian outbreak is more prevalent in regions where undernutrition is endemic</title><p>First, we explored the potential relationship between undernutrition and microcephaly associated with ZIKV through correlation analysis using the Brazilian Ministry of Health&#x02019;s integrated data bank. We focused on those states that occupied the tropical part of the country (24 of the 27 Brazilian states) since ZIKV has been more frequent there because of the abundance of its main vector, the <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. To study the hypothesized relationship, we then considered the number of cases of microcephaly that were confirmed and those still under investigation in the relevant states between 2015 and 2018 and quantified the number of undernourished patients admitted to hospitals for the same states between 2009 and 2018. Considering this catchment area, a significant positive correlation was found to exist between cases of microcephaly and occurrences of undernourishment (<italic>r</italic> = 0.4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Since this correlation, although significant, is subtle, we used a probabilistic simulation approach to test whether the observed pattern is significant. The observed correlation coefficient resulted in <italic>r</italic> = 0.4, and the <italic>P</italic>-adjusted value derived from the Monte Carlo simulation was 0.028 (fig. S1). In other words, this result supports the positive correlation identified between cases of microcephaly and undernutrition within the dataset, suggesting that states characterized by a higher number of cases with undernutrition over the past decade also exhibit more patients with microcephaly since the emergence of CZS in Brazil (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and table S1). Note that CZS cases are concentrated in some regions, although ZIKV infections were spread broader (fig. S2), confirming the asymmetrical geographical distribution previously reported (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Protein malnutrition reduces maternal body weight and enhances ZIKV load.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relationship between undernutrition, measured as the number of hospitalized cases due to any undernutrition, and microcephaly cases that were confirmed or under investigation in Brazil since the first American ZIKV outbreak.

Compared to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&#x000ed;stica (IBGE)], on average, the protein intake in our sample is 64.14 g/day, lower than the reported state and regional values, 69.54 and ~71.00 g/day, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The difference between the mean protein intake from the surveyed mothers of CZS babies and the reference for Cear&#x000e1; state is statistically significant (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the overall distribution of protein intake levels in the survey is skewed toward lower levels. On the basis of these results, the relative risk was estimated by using the odd ratio formula, which compares the proportion of cases under or above the suggested protein intake of the interviewed mothers against that referenced by Cear&#x000e1; state. The resulting odd ratio of 1.5 indicates that there is a trend for CZS to be more probable in the protein-restricted group than in the well-nourished group of mothers (table S3). However, confidence intervals for the 95% of the distribution are 0.96 to 2.34, and the odd ratio estimate (1.5) results in a marginally significant <italic>P</italic> value (0.07).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ZIKV infection results in higher viral load and reduced body weight in undernourished pregnant mice</title><p>To experimentally investigate the relationship between protein malnutrition and CZS, we used wild-type C57BL/6 females.

Since CZS is distributed heterogeneously, cofactors could play a role in this asymmetrical pattern (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Recently, it was suggested that fetal genetic background could predispose to malformation development after ZIKV vertical transmission (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Beyond genetic predisposition, it was shown that environmental factors, such as the previous exposure to dengue virus, increase susceptibility to ZIKV congenital infection and lead to more exacerbated phenotypic alterations in the brain (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>). Since immune status also depends on nutritional conditions, these are crucial elements to understand differential infection outcomes (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Here, we identify the effect of nutritional restriction on CZS development.</p><p>First, we found that there is a positive correlation between regions with a high index of undernourished patients and regions with a high incidence of microcephaly cases registered during the ZIKV outbreak in Brazil. Furthermore, we interviewed mothers of CZS children and observed a reduced protein intake in approximately 40% of them. In comparison to the state and regional protein intake average, CZS mothers show a significant protein restriction. Moreover, the values obtained in our sample of CZS mothers differ from previously published references for pregnancies in other regions of Brazil (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). It has been reported that CZS is more prevalent in low-income populations (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Nutritional impairment has been found to result in the compromise of several innate and adaptive pathways of the immune system (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>). Mainly, protein restriction is an issue in those vulnerable populations with limited access to more expensive food components (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Together, on the basis of our data and previous studies, we propose that nutritional status could, at least partially, contribute to the asymmetrical prevalence of CZS.</p><p>The link between malnutrition and CZS was further investigated in vivo with wild-type mice (fig. S14). Different reports have found that adult wild-type mice under normal conditions are not very efficient in replicating and vertically transmitting ZIKV (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>), and consequently, a large part of the research modeling ZIKV infection in vivo used immunocompromised animals (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). Although vertical transmission of ZIKV is detected in some wild-type mice, these animals do not model the primary microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>), suggesting that disparities among models might depend on the particularities of the experimental designs such as ZIKV virus strain, amount of inoculated PFUs, and time between inoculation and harvesting, among others. Here, immunocompetent mice were used, allowing us to explore CZS in a context that better reflect pathophysiological responses in humans. We found that wild-type female mice exposed to protein restriction exhibit an increased viral load in the maternal spleens 3 days after infection. Previous work has also shown that adult wild-type C57BL/6J females infected with ZIKV intraperitoneally are capable of clearing the circulating virus in the first dpi (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). These results indicate that LP animals did not eliminate the circulating virus as soon as well-nourished animals, suggesting that antiviral response may be compromised in malnutrition. Differences in the maternal response to viral infection between Co/ZIKV and LP/ZIKV could reflect variations in the immunological maternal status, which might have an impact in the developing embryos. It has been described that ZIKV preferably replicates at the placenta (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). In our study, placentas from both infected groups (LP/ZIKV and Co/ZIKV) had comparable viral loads for total RNA detections, as measured by RT-qPCR. However, immunohistochemistry labeling using anti-J2 (dsRNA) and anti-NS1 antibodies as well as PCR analyses on replicative intermediate negative-strand RNA suggest that there are differences regarding viral replication of ZIKV between Co and LP infected groups.</p><p>Placental damage caused by ZIKV has been proven to be an important contributor to embryonic and fetal growth restriction (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>).

Moreover, necrotic areas found in the labyrinth reflect severe pathological processes occurring in this organ. Analysis of the LP/ZIKV placenta indicates that a differential local response is triggered at E15, shortly after the infection, at E12, with concomitant structural alterations. In contrast, immunocompetent dams infected with ZIKV earlier, at E9.5, also display structural placental damage after 4 dpi (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Thus, these results point out that the severity of the placental impairment resulting from ZIKV infection depends on the embryonic stage of infection and the harvesting time point. This placental damage could be essential to understand some features of growth impairment in the offspring that not only result from direct embryonic infection but also indirect pathogenic mechanisms. In sum, we agree on the importance of placental insufficiency effects in the emergence of CZS beyond direct fetal infection (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>).</p><p>Associated with a differential maternal response to ZIKV infection and placental damage, we found phenotypic changes in the LP infected group comparable to previous descriptions of CZS both in humans and in animal models: intrauterine growth restriction, placental injury, impaired neurogenesis, and local inflammation (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). Body weight reduction is a clear sign of intrauterine growth restriction, a condition that was described as part of CZS in humans (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>) and mouse models (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Recently, a survey showed that the prevalence of low birth weight is four times higher in CZS children compared to other newborns from the same region (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>). In our assays, we found body weight reduction in infected malnourished litters, consistent with the findings in human CZS cases. A recent study on wild-type C57BL/6J mice have found that vertical transmission of ZIKV after intraperitoneal injection on pregnant females does not result in morphological alterations in the offspring during perinatal life but negative outcomes appeared later in postnatal life (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). This coincides with our results of Co/ZIKV in which we confirmed ZIKV congenital infection, but we did not find phenotypic signals of CZS in embryos and neonates. Since structural alterations were found here during prenatal and early postnatal life in the LP/ZIKV group, these results suggest that protein restriction diet contributes to the negative outcomes on ZIKV congenitally infected specimens.</p><p>The devastating consequences of ZIKV infection in developing nervous systems were previously linked to its tropism for immature neural cells (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). Here, embryonic macrophagic cells in the brain colocalized with ZIKV. A previous in vitro study showed that microglia cells are also a ZIKV target (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>). Thus, neuroinflammation could play a key role in the pathogenesis of CZS. In this neuropathological context, we described impairment of the neurogenesis and cortical development pre- and postnatally. The cerebral cortex is relatively more affected in LP/ZIKV than other brain structures, similar to what is described in human CZS (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). To molecularly understand those effects on brain development associated with malnutrition and ZIKV infection, we performed RNA-seq. Comparing the group where infection was combined with nutritional restriction, the control diet infected animals resulted in altered molecular pathways related to cell cycle, viral replication, DNA damage, and inhibition of neurogenesis. This largely coincides with those deregulated pathways in the 3-day in vitro ZIKV-infected neurospheres (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). More specifically, because of ZIKV infection following undernutrition, some genes, such as <italic>Cd46</italic>, relevant to immune response are down-regulated, and proinflammatory response genes, such as <italic>Il6</italic>, are up-regulated. Several genes required for normal brain development, like <italic>Shank1</italic> and <italic>Ncam2</italic>, are down-regulated in LP/ZIKV, indicating that specific processes leading to neural growth and patterning are impaired. Besides, the mTOR signaling pathway, significant for neural development, is deregulated. Similarly, a previous report also found alterations of this pathway in CZS human twins (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>).</p><p>Malnutrition is one of the most frequent causes of increased susceptibility to infectious disease (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>) and is a widespread problem in low-income populations (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>). Our experimental approach provides a framework for investigating the interaction of malnutrition and ZIKV in vivo. We have found that protein restriction mediates ZIKV infection and exacerbates developmental impairment in the offspring, suggesting that the nutritional status of the dam can be a determining factor in differential susceptibility to CZS. ZIKV infection is a complex pathological process in which the magnitude of the congenital abnormalities is not only associated with the viral load in each tissue; indirect factors such as placental damage can also play important roles in development of these abnormalities (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). To deepen current knowledge on the emergence of CZS, it is essential to understand the cofactors modulating previous outbreaks, thus improving preventive measurements facing future epidemics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Epidemiological analyses on Brazilian cases of microcephaly and undernutrition</title><p>First, data were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health via the integrated data bank RESP (Registro de Eventos em Sa&#x000fa;de P&#x000fa;blica/Public Health Events Registry) to quantify the total amount of cases of microcephaly that were confirmed and reported still under examination between 2015 and 2018. This amount was standardized by 1000 inhabitants. The total number of patients hospitalized by any type of undernutrition between 2009 and 2018, normalized by 1000 inhabitants, were extracted from the Brazilian Ministry of Health public data bank CID-10 (Classifica&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Estat&#x000ed;stica Internacional de Doen&#x000e7;as e Problemas Relacionados &#x000e0; Sa&#x000fa;de/International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.datasus.gov.br/cid10/V2008/cid10.htm">www.datasus.gov.br/cid10/V2008/cid10.htm</ext-link>. Undernutrition was defined by the health agents as cases diagnosed and satisfying at least one of the following conditions: kwashiorkor, nutritional marasmus, severe calorie-protein undernutrition, moderate to mild calorie-protein undernutrition, growth retardation due to calorie-protein undernutrition, and nonspecified calorie-protein undernutrition. For the definition of these categories, which were codified as E40-46 in the CID-10 public bank, the criteria defined by the World Health Organization were applied. A decade&#x02019;s worth of data regarding hospitalization due to undernutrition was taken to have a more consistent description of this variable. The coefficient of variation for the raw number of patients hospitalized by undernutrition over these years ranged between 2.00 for the state of Sergipe and 11.15 for the state of Espirito Santo. To avoid sampling bias, municipals with less than 20,000 inhabitants were excluded. Values for both variables (microcephaly and undernourishment) were obtained for all tropical states in the Northeast, North, Central-West, and Southeast regions. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed, and a simple linear regression was also carried out to assess the association between both variables. After obtaining a <italic>P</italic> value under the assumptions of a parametric test for this correlation, a simulation approach was used to estimate the significance of the correlation using a Monte Carlo permutation analysis. For this purpose, the values from our original sample were randomly correlated (999 times), and the frequency of each <italic>r</italic> coefficient was registered and illustrated in fig. S1. Then, by comparing our original <italic>r</italic> coefficient in the simulated distribution, it was possible to detect how probable our correlation to occur by chance is, and an adjusted <italic>P</italic> value was derived.</p><p>In addition, a survey on a sample of mothers who have children with CZS was performed in the Northeastern state of Cear&#x000e1;. We interviewed 83 affected mothers, and a diet frequency questionnaire was completed, in which we asked the number of times they ate different categories of foods per week. Data that support this part of the study are available on request from the corresponding author (P.P.G.). Ethical approval was obtained for data collection in protocol 2385592 from the Federal University of Cear&#x000e1;. On this basis, we quantified the amount of daily protein consumption by multiplying the daily frequency of consumption of each food by the protein content of this food in a standard portion. The total daily protein intake was obtained by summing these values for the consumed foods, as described by Rogers and Emmett (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>). According to current recommendations, the average consumption of protein during pregnancy should be above ~60 g/day (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nrv.gov.au/nutrients/protein">www.nrv.gov.au/nutrients/protein</ext-link>). We subsequently quantified the number of cases where consumption was either below or above 61 g/day to have an estimation of the portion of the sample affected by low protein intake.</p><p>The pattern of protein intake obtained from the interviewed mothers was compared with a reference for the state of Cear&#x000e1; and the whole Northeast region. For this purpose, we used the &#x0201c;Survey of familiar incomes 2008-2009&#x0201d; (Pesquisa de or&#x000e7;amento familiares 2008-2009) database of the IBGE and depicted the average values for Cear&#x000e1; and the Northeast together with the histogram of our sample. For Cear&#x000e1; state, the average value of protein intake was estimated from the data on the frequency of consumption of different foods, while the value of daily protein intake for the entire Northeastern region is available in the IBGE data bank by age and sex. In this case, the protein intake of women between 19 and 59 years was taken as a reference. In addition, we statistically compared the means of our sample and reference of Cear&#x000e1; for the variable daily protein intake using a <italic>t</italic> test. Similarly, we estimated the relative risk of CZS in relation to the protein intake level. Since our condition (CZS) had low frequency in the population, we carried out the analyses under &#x0201c;the rare disease assumption&#x0201d; and estimated the odd ratio (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>). Given that the frequency of CZS is rare in the population, reference data for Cear&#x000e1; can be considered as representative of the protein intake of a non-CZS group.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental design: Diet and infection</title><p>C57BL/6 nulliparous female 6-week-old mice were obtained from the Animal Care Facility of the Microbiology Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. They were divided into two groups according to the consumed diet. Control females were fed a standard diet with the recommended amount of macro- and micronutrients (TD91352, Harlan Teklad, Madison). In the control diet, protein content was 20.3%. In contrast, the LP group received a diet with 6.1% of protein in the form of casein and <sc>dl</sc>-methionine. These diets are isocaloric (3.8 kcal/g), having the same percentage of fat (5.5%) and a different proportion of carbohydrates (control, 61.6%; LP, 75.6%).</p><p>Administration of both diets started 7 to 10 days before mating and continued until the harvesting dates. Animals had ad libitum access to water and food. Throughout the whole experiment, we assessed food intake daily. No significant differences between groups were found regarding the amount of consumed food. Females were housed in single cages throughout the whole experiment. Pregnancy was confirmed through observation of the postcoital vaginal plug to have an accurate estimation of embryonic age.</p><p>On E12, we performed intraperitoneal injections in control and LP dams of ZIKV (infected) or Mock (noninfected). Dams were injected with 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of a Brazilian ZIKV strain obtained from a patient presenting typical symptoms of ZIKV infection (Recife/Brazil, ZIKV PE/243, accession no. KX197192.1) (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). For experimental comparisons with noninfected animals, we injected control and LP dams with the supernatant of <italic>A. albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells (Mock). The viral titer of the stock was 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/ml, and the injected volume was 295 &#x003bc;l. These treatments yielded four experimental groups: control/Mock (control diet, noninfected), control/ZIKV (control diet, ZIKV infected), LP/Mock (LP, noninfected), and LP/ZIKV (LP/ZIKV infected). Harvesting of samples was carried out during embryonic life in E15 and on the first day of postnatal life (P0). In the case of E15 sample harvesting, dams were culled using cervical dislocation. Neonates at P0 were decapitated. Embryos and neonates were weighed on a standard laboratory scale with a definition of 1 mg (OHAUS, USA) before decapitation.</p><p>Weight in E15 embryos was measured in specimens of each litter giving a total sample of <italic>n</italic> = 33 (Co/Mock), <italic>n</italic> = 33 (Co/ZIKV), <italic>n</italic> = 27 (LP/Mock), and <italic>n</italic> = 50 (LP/ZIKV). For Co/Mock, five independent litters in E15 were used (number of embryos for each litter = 3, 7, 7, 8, and 8), while for the Co/ZIKV embryos, weights derived from six independent litters (number of embryos for each litter = 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9) were measured. For LP/Mock, four independent litters were used (number of embryos for each litter = 5, 7, 7, and 8), and last, in LP/ZIKV, embryos from seven litters were weighed (number of embryos for each litter = 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 9, and 10). In P0, we reported body weights from those specimens that were CT-scanned to obtain brain size (Co/Mock, <italic>n</italic> = 9 neonates from three independent litters; Co/ZIKV, <italic>n</italic> = 6 neonates from two independent litters; LP/Mock, <italic>n</italic> = 6 neonates from three independent litters; and LP/ZIKV, <italic>n</italic> = 20 from four independent litters).</p><p>ZIKV was propagated in C6/36 cells. Briefly, C6/36 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. After 1 hour, the inoculum was removed and replaced with growth media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. After 6 days, the conditioned medium was harvested, centrifuged at 300<italic>g</italic>, and filtered through 0.22 &#x003bc;m to remove cells and cellular debris. Supernatants were collected and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

ZIKV copies were determined by interpolation onto a standard curve composed of eight 10-fold serial dilutions of a synthetic ZIKV RNA based on the Asian lineage. The ZIKV quantification was expressed as ZIKV RNA copies per gram of tissue. For maternal spleens 3 dpi, the sample size was 4 for Mock, 4 for Co/ZIKV, and 5 for LP/ZIKV. In addition, in E15 placentas, the sampling included organs from five independent litters for each group. Numbers of placentas of each litter within each group were as follows: Mock = 1, 1, 2, 3, and 6 (<italic>n</italic> = 13); Co/ZIKV = 1, 1, 2, 3, and 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 10); and LP/ZIKV = 2, 2, 2, 2, and 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 11).</p><p>For the specific negative-strand RNA detection, total RNA from tissue samples was purified with the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN), following the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Reverse transcription was performed with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using only forward primers (ZIKV 1086) for the specific retrotranscription of the negative strand of viral RNA. Subsequently, qPCR was performed using the ZIKV PrimeTime assay (IDT) on the GoTaq Probe qPCR System (Promega). A standard curve provided by serial dilutions of ZIKV synthetic RNA was used for absolute quantification.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Measurements of hormones in maternal serum</title><p>Systemic levels of IGF1 and leptin were assessed in maternal serum using the following kits: Abcam ab100695 and a100718.

Brains in each group belong at least to two different litters. For each brain, three consecutive sections were analyzed, and an average of their results was taken as the representative value for the specimen. All data collection was performed by one of the authors (J.B.-A.) using a blinding code. Previous to definite data collection, we analyzed intraobserver repeatability in a subsample of images and confirmed consistency in marker identification.

For skulls, a set of 42 bilateral landmarks was registered for each specimen, as described by Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic> (fig. S13) (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). For brains, we followed the protocol proposed by Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>) to obtain the position of 57 landmarks and semilandmarks. Data collection was performed by one of the authors (J.B.-A.), who had previously applied the same protocol and measured the intraobserver error for this kind of data (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Landmark and semilandmark coordinates were superimposed (Procrustes Analysis), and comprehensive measures of skull and brain size (centroid size) were obtained. Briefly, centroid size is defined as the square root of the summed squared distances of all digitized landmarks to the centroid of the configuration. Total brain size was estimated following this formula and using all the digitized points. In addition, since each point was digitized in an identifiable brain structure, for further analysis, we examined those landmarks and semilandmarks describing only the cortex. Figure S12 shows a transversal view of the cortex described by points 7 to 16, while in the sagittal, the cortex is represented by 16 to 23. Then, this restricted set of landmarks and semilandmarks describing the cortex was used to calculate cortex centroid size. A ratio between cortex and total brain centroid size was obtained for each experimental group as a variable to compare the proportion of the cortex in relation to the whole brain. Larger ratios correspond to brains in which cortex is relatively larger, while smaller ratios indicate that the cortex is relatively reduced.</p><p>While we did not digitize semilandmarks in the skull, in the brain, its structure demanded the use of semilandmarks (fig.

In this case, semilandmaks were sliced previously to superimposition using the function procSym of the Morpho R package.</p><p>The relationship between body weight and brain size was examined to understand whether the registered brain sizes correspond to the expected values for their body weights. For this purpose, a linear model was carried out for the brain centroid size on body weight and the resulting residuals, which represent the deviations of the actual brain size of each case from the predicted value according to the body weight, as described by Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Positive values for the residuals indicate that brain size is larger than expected for certain body weight, while negative values suggest that brain size is smaller for body weight.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For all variables, a preliminary Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was carried out to test normality.

Because of the distribution observed in the weight of E15 embryos, we performed a Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances using R as well. Before statistical analyses, we tested for power analysis according to our sample sizes by means of the function pwr.anova.test in R. For those variables that had at least one experimental group that departs from normality, we performed comparisons between means using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and in those cases in which significant difference was detected, we performed pairwise comparisons using Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> analyses. *<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, and ***<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001.</p></sec></sec>
