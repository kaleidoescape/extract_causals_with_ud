This study investigates the cellular changes that occur in lymph nodes in response to ischemia and reperfusion. Lymph node containing superficial epigastric artery-based groin flaps were isolated in Prox-1 EGFP rats which permits real time identification of lymphatic tissue by green fluorescence during flap dissection. Flaps were subjected to ischemia for either 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours, by temporarily occluding the vascular pedicle. Flaps were harvested after 0 hours, 24 hours, or 5 days of reperfusion. Using EGFP signal guidance, lymph nodes were isolated from the flaps and tissue morphology, cell apoptosis, and inflammatory cytokines were quantified and analyzed via histology, immunostaining, and rtPCR. There was a significant increase in collagen deposition and tissue fibrosis in lymph nodes after 4 and 8 hours of ischemia compared to 1 and 2 hours, as assessed by picrosirius red staining. Cell apoptosis significantly increased after 4 hours of ischemia in all harvest times. In tissue subject to 4 hours of ischemia, longer reperfusion periods were associated with increased rates of CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup> cell apoptosis. rtPCR analysis demonstrated significantly increased expression of CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1; with 2 hours of ischemia and increased PECAM-1 and TNF-&#x003b1; expression with 1 hour of ischemia. Significant cell death and changes in tissue morphology do not occur until after 4 hours of ischemia; however, analysis of inflammatory biomarkers suggests that ischemia reperfusion injury can occur with as little as 2 hours of ischemia.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K08HL132110-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4068-5230</contrib-id><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Alex K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DK114645-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Young-Kwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funded by Alex Wong - 1K08HL132110-01A1.

In the United States, lymphedema most commonly occurs following oncological therapy, such as surgery or radiation [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is no curative treatment for lymphedema, but vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) has been shown to be an effective surgical treatment modality for secondary lymphedema [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The success of VLNT is dependent on the survival of lymph nodes within transplanted tissue, as they are the functional units responsible for fluid transport.</p><p>The signs of ischemia in vascularized lymph nodes are less readily appreciable than, for example, muscle flaps. The lymph nodes are often encased in a cushion of fat, which has the potential to mask subtle visual signs of lymph node ischemia or ischemia injury. Furthermore, other than partial or complete flap loss, the success or failure of a VLNT is a long-term clinical outcome and not known in the immediate post-operative period. Therefore, the perioperative appearance of VLNT flaps may not be sensitive enough to correlate with outcome. As such, knowing how lymphatic tissue responds to ischemia-reperfusion injury and defining a critical ischemia time would be clinically valuable.</p><p>Ischemia is defined as a decrease or absence of blood delivery to tissue [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Critical ischemia time is the maximum amount of time a tissue can withstand ischemia without evidence of injury [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most tissues can tolerate ischemia without significant injury if the ischemic period is relatively short. During free tissue transfer, ischemia time can range from 45 minutes to 3 hours [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Ischemia time is a potentially modifiable factor influencing the long-term viability of transplanted tissue. While a short period of ischemia is inevitable during free tissue transfer, prolonged ischemia initiates a cascade of cellular changes that result in irreversible cell membrane damage, which translates to poor post-operative outcomes. In addition to the deleterious effects of prolonged ischemia, organ reperfusion also accelerates the rate of cellular damage that leads to apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Critical ischemia time in muscle, skin, and other tissues have been extensively investigated in animal and human models [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227599.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Relatively little is known about the effect of ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury on lymph nodes and lymphatic tissue [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227599.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since we recently developed and characterized a transgenic rat which facilitates <italic>in situ</italic> real time visualization of lymphatic tissue (Prox1-EGFP), this has enabled us to precisely identify and isolate lymph nodes from surrounding tissue and analyze the cellular changes that occurred within lymph nodes [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we conducted a detailed study on the effect of ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion on lymph nodes, investigating the biochemical and physiological changes of lymph nodes in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California. The Prox1-EGFP reporter rats used in this study were developed previously, characterized our laboratory, and described by Jung, E. et. al. [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Specifically, a Prox1-harboring BAC (RP23-360I16), where the EGFP gene was inserted distal to the mouse Prox1 proximal promoter was used to generate a Sprague-Dawley Prox1-EGFP founder line at Cyagen Biosciences and subsequently expanded at our facility. In this experiment, forty-eight adult Prox1-EGFP rats weighing between 300 and 500 grams, were used. The animals were housed in a temperature and light controlled environment and fed a standard rodent diet and water ad libitum. Hydrogel and nutrient rich gel were provided postoperatively. The animals were observed twice daily, their behavior was assessed for signs of distress, and their wounds checked for infection, dehiscence, and other complications. At the experimental endpoint, animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by a confirmatory double thoracotomy.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Operative procedure</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with 1mL/100g of a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (100mg/kg ketamine + 10mg/kg xylazine) via intraperitoneal injection and were given approximately 1mg/kg slow release buprenorphine subcutaneously immediately prior to surgery. Epigastric flaps were created as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227599.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Briefly, the abdomen was shaved, a depilatory cream was applied, the area was prepped with povidone-iodine scrub solution, and a 2&#x02013;3 cm skin incision was made in line with the inguinal crease. The subcutaneous tissue flap was dissected free from the skin, verified to contain lymph nodes by green fluorescent signal, and further isolated based on the superficial inferior epigastric artery and vein (SIEA and SIEV). The SIEA and SIEV were then skeletonized under a surgical microscope (M500N; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) down to their origin off the femoral vessels. All perforating vessels were either ligated or cauterized to ensure that the vascular pedicle consisted of only the SIEA and SIEV. The femoral artery and vein distal and proximal to the SIEA and SIEV were then skeletonized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227599.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and microsurgical vessel clamps were placed on the femoral vessels proximal and distal the SIEA and SIEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227599.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) to achieve total ischemia. The flap was placed back into the animal, and the incision was closed with simple interrupted 4&#x02013;0 Vicryl (Ethicon) sutures. This procedure was then repeated on the contralateral side.</p><fig id="pone.0227599.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227599.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Blood supply and ischemia induction of the groin flaps.</title><p>(A) Gross image of the skeletonized vessels supplying the groin flap created.

A double-staining assay was also performed using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, lymph node sections were deparaffinized, underwent antigen retrieval using a sodium citrate buffer, permeabilized, and then incubated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD45 overnight (1:200 rabbit anti-rat; ab5690, ab10558, Abcam). Tissues were then washed in PBS and incubated with red secondary antibodies for CD3 and CD45 (1:200 goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Next, the In-Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used according to the manufacturer protocol. Finally, sections were mounted and stained with DAPI.</p><p>Collagen content within the harvested lymph nodes was quantified with Picrosirius red staining. Samples were deparaffinized, rehydrated with distilled water, then incubated in Picrosirius red solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for one hour.

For each analysis, three high-power fields per section were randomly selected and then analyzed by a blinded reviewer. First, the number of TUNEL-positive cells per square millimeter was quantified. Next, the percentage of apoptotic CD3<sup>+</sup> cells was calculated by dividing the number cells positive for both CD3 and TUNEL by the total number of CD3<sup>+</sup>. The same analysis was performed for CD45<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>The images of the Picrosirius red staining were obtained with a Keyence BZ-X700 microscope (Itasca, IL), and the samples were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethseda, MD). A custom macro was written in ImageJ Macro language to calculate the percent area of collagen for tissue stained with Picro-Sirius Red by using the Color Threshold function in ImageJ (Appendix A: Picrisirius_red_ijm). The macro determines the red pixels in an image by using threshold settings of hue, saturation, and brightness. The threshold settings were determined by using a test set of 106 images. The macro then converts the red pixels into individual particles and calculates the percent area that is stained. The percentage of collagen area is calculated as the area of Picrosirius red stained tissue divided by the total area in order to quantify tissue fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>rtPCR</title><p>Tissue collected for rtPCR was placed into cryovials and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Although the critical ischemia time of most tissue types has been comprehensively described, we have a limited understanding of the effect ischemia has on lymph nodes [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227599.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227599.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227599.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Vascularized lymph node transfer has emerged as a viable option for the treatment of early lymphedema. The physical appearance of fat and lymphatic tissue is likely not a reliable marker for small but clinically significant ischemia-reperfusion injury. Additionally, a successful outcome from a VLNT is often determined long after the initial surgery. Given these unique characteristics of VLNT, understanding how lymph nodes tolerate ischemia and even defining a critical ischemia time would be highly useful information for clinical practice. We aimed to quantify the apoptosis and fibrosis, as well as describe changes in ischemia-reperfusion specific gene expression in lymph nodes after ischemia and reperfusion. We also aimed to define a critical ischemia time.</p><p>Not surprisingly, and consistent with previous findings, the degree of cell injury and subsequent apoptosis increased with ischemia time [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our data demonstrates a significant increase in the rate of cell apoptosis beginning at 4 hours of ischemia. Additionally, immune cell death increased proportionally with prolonged reperfusion, with significant ischemia-reperfusion injury after 24 hours of reperfusion. This suggests that the immune cell components of lymph nodes are especially sensitive to reperfusion injury. Finally, lymph nodes underwent a significant fibrotic change after 4 hours of ischemia. Intuitively, we would hypothesize that the significant fibrosis of lymph nodes at 4 hours of ischemia would have an impact on the lymphatic drainage, however, functional studies of lymphatic flow are needed.</p><p>Upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b1;, MUC1, and PECAM-1 was as a marker of ischemia reperfusion injury in lymph nodes. Dynamic changes in these cytokines have been previously implicated in ischemia reperfusion injury. For example, CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1; is upregulated in the early phases of cerebral ischemia, and promotes leukocyte migration to the inflamed tissue [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Enhanced levels of TNF-&#x003b1; expression have been observed following ischemia in both the brain [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227599.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and cardiac tissue [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Serum PECAM-1 levels have been shown to be elevated following ischemia reperfusion in rats [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Additionally, blocking PECAM-1 attenuated neutrophil migration and accumulation in rat muscle flaps, demonstrating an overall protective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227599.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Subjecting groin flaps to as little as 2 hours of ischemia resulted in significant changes in lymphatic gene expression. A 40-fold transient increase in the expression of CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1; resulted after just two hours of ischemia. However, prolonged reperfusion (5 days) returned expression levels of CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1; back to baseline whereas MUC1, PECAM-1, and TNF-&#x003b1; expression remained elevated after the same reperfusion period. CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1; levels peaked with 2 hours of ischemia in tissue harvested immediately after reperfusion was established. PECAM-1 and MUC1 both peaked with 2 hours of ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion. TNF-&#x003b1; levels peaked with 2 hours of ischemia and 5 days of reperfusion. These results suggest that CXCL1/GRO-&#x003b1; may be a valuable biomarker to monitor ischemia-reperfusion injury in lymph node flaps due to the dramatic increase in gene expression in response to ischemia.</p><p>Understanding the effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury on lymphatic tissue can help guide the perioperative management of patients undergoing VLNT. VLNT is promising therapeutic. A greater understanding of the ischemic tolerance of lymphatic tissue has the potential to improve outcomes and prevent complications [<xref rid="pone.0227599.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. If lymph nodes reach their critical ischemia time intraoperatively, the lymphatic tissue will lose viability. Since the lymph nodes are typically enveloped within fat, which is highly ischemia tolerant, reaching the critical ischemia time of a lymph node may not result in flap loss, but could result in loss of function of the graft. Therefore, a defined critical ischemia time would be a highly practical piece of information. Furthermore, beyond the bedside application of a critical ischemia time, investigating rates of cellular apoptosis, effects on the adaptive immune response, and gene expression of various cytokines may shed light on the mechanisms of reperfusion injury, eventually leading to targeted therapies to block or attenuate the pathways that lead to tissue damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest that significant ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs in lymph nodes after 4 hours of ischemia. Thus, vascularized lymph node flaps that are exposed to 4 hours of ischemia during VLNT are at risk for irreversible cellular injury that could impair lymph node flap function. Further exploration of the inflammatory cascade specific to lymph nodes may elucidate useful biomarkers in predicting ischemia-reperfusion injury and, ultimately, flap failure.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227599.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Warren</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brorson</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Borud</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Slavin</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Lymphedema: a comprehensive review</article-title>. <source>Ann Plast Surg</source>. <year>2007</year>;<volume>59</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>464</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>72</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/01.sap.0000257149.42922.7e</pub-id>

Lymph node containing superficial epigastric artery-based groin flaps were isolated in a Sprague Dawley rat model. Flaps were subjected to ischemia for either 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours, by temporarily occluding the vascular pedicle. Flaps were harvested after 0 hours, 24 hours, or 5 days of reperfusion. They concluded that significant cell death and changes in tissue morphology don&#x02019;t occur until after 4 hours of ischemia; however, analysis of inflammatory biomarkers suggests that ischemia reperfusion injury can occur with as little as 2 hours of ischemia.</p><p>- This article is well written and well thought-out. I applaud the authors for their effort. However, manuscript needs minor revision. Here are my comments and suggestions:</p><p>-Regarding Title, authors should add that this study was made in flaps based on the superficial inferior epigastric artery and vein.</p><p>- Figure legends should be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Additional Editor Comments:</p><p>Dear Dr Wong,</p><p>Thank you for your submission. Please answer to every reviewers comments and make changes to the manuscript your find necessary.</p><p>I have few comments?</p><p>- the histology figures are not of good quality and need to be improved. The magnification is too low power not allowing looking for histological details.</p><p>Upon further investigation, it appears that the figures were compressed during the upload process, resulting in poor quality. We reexported the histology figures using the PACE tool recommended by the PLOS One author guidelines, so that they are of higher resolution. The new figures are attached to this email. The current magnification allowed us to visualize individual cells and thus was used for analysis. </p><p>- Since you were interested in studying the lymphatic tissue why you did not use a lymphatic marker as, for example Lyve-1.</p><p>We appreciate this very relevant question. To circumvent the need to do confirmatory staining with a marker such as LYVE-1, we utilized Prox-1 eGFP transgenic animals which faithfully express eGFP in lymphatic tissues as previously described by our laboratory in the following publication: </p><p>Jung E, Gardner D, Choi D, Park E, Jin Seong Y, Yang S, Castorena-Gonzalez J, Louveau A, Zhou Z, Lee GK, Perrault DP, Lee S, Johnson M, Daghlian G, Lee M, Jin Hong Y, Kato Y, Kipnis J, Davis MJ, Wong AK, Hong YK. Development and Characterization of A Novel Prox1-EGFP Lymphatic and Schlemm's Canal Reporter Rat. Sci Rep. 2017 Jul 17;7(1):5577. </p><p>In the referenced paper, we previously demonstrated concordance between eGFP signal and lymphatic markers such as LYVE-1 and Podoplanin. Since this model has been well established in our lab and published in the peer reviewed literature, further confirmatory immunostaining with markers such as LYVE-1 was not performed. </p><p>A benefit of the Prox-1 eGFP rat was that realtime GFP fluorescence was used to precisely identify lymphatic tissue at the time of harvest. To increase the precision and clarity of our methodology, we have added specific statements in the manuscript regarding utilization of the Prox-1 eGFP rat.</p><p>Review Comments to the Author</p><p>2. At this time, we request that you please report additional details in your Methods section regarding animal care, as per our editorial guidelines:</p><p>(1) Please state the source of the rats used in the study</p><p> The Prox1-EGFP reporter rats used in this study were developed previously, characterized our laboratory, and described by Jung, E. et. al. [23], Specifically, a Prox1-harboring BAC (RP23-360I16), where the EGFP gene was inserted distal to the mouse Prox1 proximal promoter was used to generate a Sprague-Dawley Prox1-EGFP founder line at Cyagen Biosciences and subsequently expanded at our facility.</p><p>(2) Please include the method of euthanasia</p><p> Animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by a confirmatory double thoracotomy.</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: I commend the authors on a well written paper.</p><p>The main concern regards the translational nature of experimental data from the animal model to humans. Another question as stated in the discussion section is how much of the lymph transport is affected by schema time since this was not the scope of the paper.</p><p>Based on prior published literature, the epigastric flap model upon which the vascularized lymph node flap is based is highly similar to humans from an anatomic standpoint and therefore a suitable platform for translational research. One study investigated the vasculature to the integument covering the ventrolateral abdominal wall in a series of 205 rats. The study revealed that there is a high degree of homology in the anatomy of rats and humans within this region of interest (Casal 2017). The rat model effectively allows for a pedicled flap based on the superior inferior epigastric artery that is ischemic on the distal flap end (Petry 1984). As a result, the model has been used extensively to study ischemia-reperfusion injury, flap necrosis, flap microcirculation, arteriovenous fistula, arterial inflow and venous drainage, and flap prefabrication (Hsu 2018). </p><p>With respect to how one might translate information from the ischemia times tested in our experimental model to clinical practice, these experimental data may be used as a reference for clinicians to make independent case specific decisions regarding lymph node flaps that may have sustained long ischemia times. Our data may be used to the guide the decision making process in the clinical setting but we do not suggest that our data be used as absolute clinical criteria for intraoperative management of lymph node flap transfers. </p><p>The question regarding how ischemia time affects lymph transport is a good one. However, the process of lymph node flap elevation on a single arterial/venous pedicle requires separating the lymph node unit from afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels thereby making it impossible to perform functional studies that explore the effect of ischemia on lymph transport. It might be possible to assess intranodal function in future studies but this would be outside the scope of the present manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2: In this experimental study, the authors investigate the effect of ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion on lymph nodes, specifically epigastric lymph node flaps, since very little is known about the effect of ischemia on lymphatic tissue. They evaluated rats&#x02019; tissue specimens changes through both biochemical and histological methods and concluded that vascularized lymph node flaps that are exposed to 4 hours of ischemia during VLNT will likely undergo irreversible cellular injury that could impair graft function.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study as it adds a real contribution to the current literature on VLNF that mainly consists of human case series.

Below are my comments:</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>- How was the number of rats to be used in the study calculated?</p><p>A pilot study was performed in order to determine the mean number of lymph nodes per groin flap in each rat. Each flap generally contained one large lymph node that was suitable for harvest, and rarely two were found per flap. As flaps were created bilaterally in each animal, two nodes were obtained per rat. Based on a G-power calculation and accounting for 20% mortality rate based on prior experience, n=12 animals were required per group in order to achieve statistical significance. </p><p>- Who evaluated tissue changes? Was it a blinded or open label evaluation?</p><p>All image analyses were performed by a blinded reviewer. For each analysis, three high-power fields per section were randomly selected and then analyzed by a blinded reviewer. </p><p>- How was the statistical analysis conducted? Which Software was used?</p><p>- Please provide full information of the tests that have been used to report the results of the study</p><p>- Did you test the normal distribution of your population or did you assume it was not normally distributed?</p><p>In all graphs, mean &#x0571f; standard deviation values are plotted unless otherwise noted. One-way ANOVA with Tukey&#x02019;s multiple comparisons test was used to determine differences between groups in GraphPad PRISM8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). p-Values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. In order to test for normality, the Anderson-Darling test was performed in GraphPad PRISM8. All graphs and statistical analyses were generated in GraphPad PRISM8.</p><p>Reviewer #3: - In this manuscript, authors investigate the cellular changes that occur in lymph nodes in response to ischemia and reperfusion. Lymph node containing superficial epigastric artery-based groin flaps were isolated in a Sprague Dawley rat model. Flaps were subjected to ischemia for either 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours, by temporarily occluding the vascular pedicle. Flaps were harvested after 0 hours, 24 hours, or 5 days of reperfusion. They concluded that significant cell death and changes in tissue morphology don&#x02019;t occur until after 4 hours of ischemia; however, analysis of inflammatory biomarkers suggests that ischemia reperfusion injury can occur with as little as 2 hours of ischemia.</p><p>This article is well written and well thought-out. I applaud the authors for their effort.</p><p>However, manuscript needs minor revision. Here are my comments and suggestions:</p><p>Regarding Title, authors should add that this study was made in flaps based on the superficial inferior epigastric artery and vein.</p><p>The title has been changed to &#x0201c;Ischemia and reperfusion injury in superficial inferior epigastric artery-based vascularized lymph node flaps&#x0201d;.</p><p>Figure legends should be removed from the manuscript.</p><p> Figure legends have been removed from the manuscript.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227599.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers (1).docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227599.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0227599.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227599.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bianchi</surname><given-names>Cesario</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Cesario Bianchi</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Cesario Bianchi</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0227599" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
