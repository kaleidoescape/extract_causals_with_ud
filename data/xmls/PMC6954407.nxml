In recent years, <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification of eukaryotic mRNA has been subject to intense studies, and it has been demonstrated that m<sup>6</sup>A is a reversible modification that regulates several aspects of mRNA function. However, m<sup>6</sup>A is also found in other RNAs, such as mammalian 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), but the responsible MTases have remained elusive. 28S rRNA carries a single m<sup>6</sup>A modification, found at position A4220 (alternatively referred to as A4190) within a stem&#x02013;loop structure, and here we show that the MTase ZCCHC4 is the enzyme responsible for introducing this modification. Accordingly, we found that ZCCHC4 localises to nucleoli, the site of ribosome assembly, and that proteins involved in RNA metabolism are overrepresented in the ZCCHC4 interactome. Interestingly, the absence of m<sup>6</sup>A4220 perturbs codon-specific translation dynamics and shifts gene expression at the translational level. In summary, we establish ZCCHC4 as the enzyme responsible for m<sup>6</sup>A modification of human 28S rRNA, and demonstrate its functional significance in mRNA translation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Norwegian Cancer Society</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100008730</named-content></funding-source><award-id>107744-PR-2007-0132</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Research Council of Norway</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100005416</named-content></funding-source><award-id>FRIMEDBIO-240009</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Max Planck Society</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100004189</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">DFG</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id>LE 3260/3-1</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">NTNU</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100009123</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Central Norway Regional Health Authority</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100004590</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Lundbeck Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003554</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R231-2016-2682</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Novo Nordisk Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100009708</named-content></funding-source><award-id>NNF16OC0022946</award-id><award-id>NNF14CC0001</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Agence Nationale de la Recherche</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001665</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE11-0029-01</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The RNAs within a cell contain a wide range of small enzyme-mediated modifications, which contribute to expanding the repertoire of RNA building blocks (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). These modifications, collectively, are instrumental for mediating appropriate RNA folding, maintaining RNA structure and enabling the various RNA functions. More than 100 different RNA modifications have been described, and all RNA species carry modifications, with tRNAs being most heavily modified (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Methylation is the most common type of RNA modification, and numerous different methylated nucleosides are present in RNA (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>It was discovered several decades ago that the modification <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is abundant in eukaryotic mRNAs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These initial findings were followed by the identification of the catalytically active component of the corresponding human methyltransferase (MTase) as METTL3 (aka MT-A70) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Also, a regulatory function for the m<sup>6</sup>A modification was suggested by the observation that sporulation was accompanied by increased m<sup>6</sup>A levels in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In recent years, substantial progress has been made regarding m<sup>6</sup>A modification and its functional significance. Methods were developed to assess m<sup>6</sup>A modification transcriptome-wide (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and numerous proteins have been uncovered that are responsible for introducing, recognizing and removing m<sup>6</sup>A, referred to as writers, readers, and erasers, respectively (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Moreover, it has also been demonstrated that m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays an important role in regulating and optimizing many aspects of RNA function and biogenesis, including splicing, nuclear export, translation and turnover (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref>).</p><p>So far, three human MTases that install m<sup>6</sup>A in RNA have been discovered. The majority of m<sup>6</sup>A in mRNA is introduced by the MTase METTL3, which is found in complex with several additional proteins required for methylation, including the related protein METTL14 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref>). The METTL3 complex installs m<sup>6</sup>A at specific RRACH consensus sequences (R = A,&#x000a0;G; H = A,&#x000a0;C,&#x000a0;U), but mRNA is also modified at non-RRACH sites. METTL16 was recently discovered as a novel MTase that introduces m<sup>6</sup>A in a stem&#x02013;loop structure in the U6 spliceosomal RNA, but also modifies similar structures in various mRNAs, thereby regulating their function (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Finally, a 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-ribose methylated form of m<sup>6</sup>A (m<sup>6</sup>Am) is installed as part of the cap structure in mRNAs whose first transcribed nucleotide is an adenosine, and two very recent studies identified PCIF as the long-sought MTase responsible for N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine formation at the cap (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>In humans, five proteins of the YTHD family, which all contain a so-called YTH domain, are the primary reader proteins responsible for recognising m<sup>6</sup>A modifications in mRNA. The closely related YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 are localized to the cytosol where they promote translation and turnover of m<sup>6</sup>A containing mRNAs (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The nuclear reader YTHDC1 regulates splicing and export of m<sup>6</sup>A containing mRNAs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). YTHDC2, found both in the cytosol and the nucleus, interacts with the ribosome, where it promotes efficient translation of its target mRNAs, while also enhancing their degradation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Finally, the two oxidative demethylases ALKBH5 and FTO are erasers responsible for removal of m<sup>6</sup>A, thus contributing to the dynamic nature of this modification (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The ribosome represents a universally conserved molecular machine that mediates the essential function of translating genetic information, in the form of mRNA, into protein sequence. The human ribosome contains four RNAs and 80 proteins, distributed between a small (40S) and a large (60S) subunit (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The two largest rRNAs are the 18S rRNA (1869 nucleotides) and 28S rRNA (5035 nucleotides), which are the found in the 40S and 60S subunits, respectively (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). 18S and 28S rRNA both contain numerous posttranscriptional modifications, the majority being pseudouridines and 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-ribose methylations (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These are introduced by ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing snoRNAs that guide the relevant enzymatic machineries to specific locations in the RNA sequence (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Additionally, several snoRNA-independent &#x02018;stand-alone&#x02019; enzymes introduce various rRNA modifications, primarily methylations (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The assembly and maturation of the ribosome, occurring primarily within nucleoli, is a highly orchestrated process where the timely insertion of specific modifications is essential (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Here, snoRNA-directed introduction of pseudouridine and methylribose occurs at relatively early stages of ribosome maturation, whereas snoRNA-independent modifications are believed to occur at later stages (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The snoRNA-independent modifications include a single instance of m<sup>6</sup>A in each of 18S and the 28S rRNAs (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, as the MTases responsible for m<sup>6</sup>A modification of rRNA have remained elusive, it has been difficult to investigate the functional significance of these modifications.</p><p>Bioinformatics analysis indicates that the human genome encodes &#x0223c;200 different MTases that use the methyl donor <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The function of a large proportion of these enzymes remains elusive, though we have unravelled the function of several orphan MTases in recent years. In particular, we have identified several MTases that target lysines in proteins, but also RNA-specific MTases (see e.g. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;42</xref>)). Here, we have explored the function of the human orphan MTase ZCCHC4. We found that proteins involved in RNA metabolism were over-represented in the ZCCHC4 interactome, and that ZCCHC4 was localised to nucleoli, where ribosome assembly occurs. In agreement with this, we found that ablation of ZCCHC4 caused a strong reduction of m<sup>6</sup>A in total rRNA, and that this was due to a complete abolishment of the single m<sup>6</sup>A modification in 28S rRNA. The absence of m<sup>6</sup>A formation on 28S rRNA leads to ribosomes with altered activity as indicated by codon-specific translation defects. In conclusion, we here establish ZCCHC4 as a novel MTase responsible for introducing m<sup>6</sup>A at position 4220 in 28S rRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Protein sequences were aligned using the MAFFT algorithm embedded in JalView (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).

We observed an upregulation of genes representing processes related to RNA metabolism and the nucleosome, whereas genes related to signal transduction and neural development were amongst the downregulated ones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>,&#x000a0;D). Taken together, our results indicate that ribosomes lacking the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of 28S rRNA exhibit deviating translation activity.</p><p>The observed effects of <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO on mRNA translation may be directly caused by the absence of methylation at A4220. However, lack of methylation may also affect the assembly and maturation of the ribosome, so that the observed translation effect may be due to an aberrant ribosome, rather than the specific lack of m<sup>6</sup>A4220. To explore the possible role of ZCCHC4 in ribosome maturation, we investigated by northern blotting the kinetics of rRNA processing in HAP-1 cells but did not observe any differences between <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO and WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). We also investigated by sucrose gradient density centrifugation, the relative distribution of polysomes versus monosomes in WT and <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO HAP-1 cells, but did not detect any differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5F</xref>). Furthermore, to investigate possible effects of <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO on ribosome assembly, we performed a quantitative proteomics analysis of translating ribosomes from these cells, but again without observing any significant differences between the KO and WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Taken together, these results indicates that <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO does not substantially affect ribosome maturation and assembly, and may suggest that the deviating translation in the <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO cells may reflect a direct effect on mRNA translation of the lack of methylation of 28S rRNA at A4220.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have here investigated the function of the human MTase ZCCHC4. We found that <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO in HAP-1 cells abrogated m<sup>6</sup>A modification of A4220 (alternatively referred to as A4190) in 28S rRNA, and that recombinant ZCCHC4 showed robust methylation activity on an RNA oligonucleotide encompassing the methylation site. Taken together, this firmly established ZCCHC4 as the enzyme responsible for introducing the single m<sup>6</sup>A modification present in 28S rRNA. Moreover, we observed that ZCCHC4 is localized to the nucleolus, the primary location of ribosome synthesis, assembly and maturation, and ZCCHC4 was found to interact with a number of RNA-binding proteins. Finally, <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO cells displayed altered translation dynamics, demonstrating a functional significance of ZCCHC4-mediated methylation of rRNA.</p><sec id="SEC4-1"><title>Codon-specific effects of <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO on mRNA translation</title><p>In ribosomal profiling experiments, we observed that <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO affected the occupancy at several different codons during translation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Moreover, many of the codons that showed the strongest increase in occupancy (i.e. reduction of translation speed) in the <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO cells have a weak codon-anticodon interaction, whereas several of those that showed the largest decrease in occupancy (i.e. increase of translation speed) have a strong interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Only a subset of the codons in the STRONG and WEAK groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) showed this effect, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive, but we still find it important to share this observation. Moreover, the interactions occurring between the ribosomal A-site and the helix formed by the anticodon/codon, referred to as the &#x02018;ribosomal grip&#x02019;, can vary between different codons (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Thus, one may speculate that effects of m<sup>6</sup>A4220 methylation on the ribosomal grip may underlie the observed codon-specific effects of <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO on mRNA translation. It may be interesting to study translation dynamics of m<sup>6</sup>A4420-deficient ribosomes <italic>in vitro</italic> to determine the exact step in the elongation cycle that is affected by the lack of this modification.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>Comparison with other studies on ZCCHC4-mediated rRNA methylation</title><p>While this manuscript was in preparation, Ma <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> reported results similar to those obtained herein, i.e. they showed, using somewhat different experimental approaches, that ZCCHC4 is responsible for installing m<sup>6</sup>A at A4220 (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Moreover, another relevant study appeared during the revision of our manuscript; van Tran <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, established METTL5 as the MTase responsible for m<sup>6</sup>A modification of 18S rRNA, but also showed that <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO abolished m<sup>6</sup>A modification of 28S rRNA (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Interestingly, all three studies (Ma <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, van Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, and our study) have investigated various functional effects of <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO, particularly related to the ribosome and mRNA translation. We observed gene- and codon-specific effects of <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO on mRNA translation in ribosomal profiling experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), whereas Ma <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> performed sequencing of polysome-associated mRNAs, and observed a broader mRNA(polysome)/mRNA(input) profile in the <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO cells, indicating a reduction of translational control (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Furthermore, Ma <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> compared WT and <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO cells in polysome profiling experiments, and found that the polysome/monosome ratio was reduced in the <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO cells (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), whereas we, as well as van Tran <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, did not observe any such difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5F</xref>) (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Both van Tran <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> and we compared the kinetics of rRNA processing in WT and <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO cells but neither study demonstrated any difference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>) (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Moreover, we investigated by proteomics the protein composition of translating ribosomes, and found no significant differences between WT and KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Although there are some differences between the results from the three studies, possibly reflecting that different cell lines were used, the conclusion may be drawn that ZCCHC4-mediated methylation appears to play an important role in the process of mRNA translation, but is less important for ribosome assembly and maturation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>Role of ZCCHC4 in cell growth and cancer</title><p>Interestingly, the study by Ma <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> implicated ZCCHC4 in cancer cell growth and tumour progression. They found that <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO diminished the growth of the liver cancer cell line HepG2 both in tissue culture and as tumour xenografts in mice (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Furthermore, higher levels of ZCCHC4 protein and m<sup>6</sup>A in 28S rRNA were observed in liver cancer tissue compared to surrounding, healthy tissue (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). In contrast, van Tran <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> did not see any effect of <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO on the growth of HCT116 cells (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). However, there are indications that the level of m<sup>6</sup>A in 28S rRNA may vary between different cell lines. Our data suggested near-complete methylation of A4220 in HEK-293 cells and HAP-1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, respectively), and Taoka <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> also observed complete methylation in human TK6 and HeLa cells (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In contrast, Ma <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> found only &#x0223c;55% methylation in HepG2 cells. Possibly, such variations underlie the observed variations in the phenotypic effects of <italic>ZCCHC4</italic> KO between different cell lines.</p><p>Additional evidence for a role of ZCCHC4 in cancer comes from two studies that implicated mouse Zcchc4 in K-Ras mediated epigenetic gene silencing of the FAS gene (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). FAS is an important mediator of apoptosis, and knock-down of Zcchc4 in mouse cells caused reactivation of FAS expression, as well as loss of DNA methylation at its promoter (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). However, a role for ZCCHC4 in epigenetics and gene regulation is not readily linked to its observed rRNA MTase activity. The recent study by van Tran <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> investigated m<sup>6</sup>A modification transcriptome-wide in KO and WT HCT-116 cells, and A4220 in 28S rRNA was found to be the only differentially modified site (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Thus, there are no indications that ZCCHC4 has substrates other than 28S rRNA, and its potential role in epigenetic gene silencing remains elusive.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Proteome data for the ZCCHC4-pulldown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), m<sup>6</sup>A-RNA-pulldown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), and polysome proteomics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>) experiments are available at ProteomeExchange (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteomexchange.org/">http://www.proteomexchange.org/</ext-link>) with accession numbers PXD012346, PXD013354 and PXD015084 respectively.
