Compared with primary resistance rates, these numbers showed that the acquired drug resistances to clarithromycin and fluoroquinolone were easier than to other antibiotics, for example amoxicillin and tetracycline. The Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report mentions that, when the resistance rate to clarithromycin is more than 15%, PPI-clarithromycin-containing triple therapy without prior susceptibility testing should be abandoned.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Considering the high clarithromycin and fluoroquinolone resistance in our country,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> performing the drug sensitivity test before treatment may have a comparative advantage.</p><p>A wealth of research suggests that <italic>H. pylori</italic> resistance to clarithromycin is the most important factor for eradication failure.<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Are there any definite time span and/or external factors which influence led to the occurrence of clarithromycin resistance and 23S rRNA point mutations? One study was performed to evaluate the primary clarithromycin resistance and associated mutations in children in Poland during 1998&#x02013;2000.<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The authors found that most of the primary resistance was caused by an A2143G mutation and the prevalence of clarithromycin resistance in children was increased from 17.0% to 23.5% over the 3 years.<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Some researchers from Spain showed that clarithromycin resistance was significantly associated with patients who were previously treated, with patients born in Spain, and with pediatric patients.<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In addition, they found the relationship between clarithromycin resistance, the vacA s2/m2 genotype and cagA negative-expression.<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Hakemi Vala et al deduced that the primary resistance could be related to cross-reactivity between other macrolides.<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>As shown in <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the percentage of female patients who had failed reaction to bismuth quadruple therapy was higher than male patients. It is in line with some previous studies.<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> One study showed that female gender (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.15 to 4.25) and clarithromycin resistance (OR, 19.13; 95% CI, 9.35 to 35.09) were strongly associated with eradication failure.<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Another study also showed that female gender and smoking were associated with the treatment failure.<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The reason may be also related to clarithromycin resistance and point mutation. Research suggested that the 2143G point mutation in the 23S rRNA was a risk factor for eradication failure and the presence of 2143G was significantly associated with female sex.<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>Our study also shows that the primary and secondary resistance rates of <italic>H. pylori</italic> to amoxicillin are 5.5% and 11.7%, whereas these rates to tetracycline are 12.9% and 30.0%, respectively. A prospective serial study conducted in Beijing of China found that the primary resistance rates of <italic>H. pylori</italic> were 6.7% and 4.9% to amoxicillin and tetracycline.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Another study conducted in Shanghai of China reported the amoxicillin resistance rate was 8.3%.<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> For amoxicillin resistance, we obtained the similar result; however, for tetracycline, the rate is slightly higher than others and the reason may be associated with the patient population and prior used same class drugs.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Because the primary resistance rates to amoxicillin and tetracycline remain low in our country, it may be not necessary to consider the drug sensitivity test before use.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>For the effect and safety of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication treatment, our study showed that the ERs in the ITT and PP analyses were 92.79% and 98.10%, respectively, in the first-treated patients and 90.67% and 95.10%, respectively, in the re-treated patients. We compared our results with others from different geographical regions.<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> One study which was conducted in the Japan used vonoprazan-based eradication therapy and found that the ERs were 91.24% (427/468) and 95.45% (42/44), respectively, for the first-line therapy and the second-line therapy.<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The researchers from the Iran evaluated the efficacy of bismuth-based quadruple therapy and showed that the ERs in the ITT and PP analyses were 90.2% and 91.9%, respectively.<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Another study from the Northwest Ethiopia adopted the standard triple therapy and reached the overall eradication rate of 90.3% (379/421).<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Compared with these studies, good effect and safety were obtained in our study for both first-treated and re-treatment patients, although the high resistance rates to some antibiotics were found, and more than half the patients failed in bismuth quadruple therapy. Our results indicated that satisfactory ER could be also obtained based on the molecular pathologic antibiotic resistance.</p><p>The best effort was that the antibiotic resistance of <italic>H. pylori</italic> was determined by molecular pathologic examinations, including Real-time PCR detection and conventional PCR and sequencing method, especially the TaqMan real-time PCR allelic discrimination assay which was used to detect the clarithromycin resistance. Compared with the E-test and agar dilution method,<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> the molecular pathologic examinations gave the similar results. Moreover, satisfactory eradication rates were obtained which indicated that these examinations could be used routinely.</p><p>The first limitation may be that our study was conducted in one large-scale medical center of China and the selection bias may not be avoided. The patient population may be different from those patients treated in the small and medium-sized hospitals, not to speak of the hospitals located in remote regions and ethnic minority regions. In addition, a meaningful portion of the fees for molecular pathologic examinations were afforded by the patients. The second limitation may be that only 261 patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection were included in our study. We wish that our results and conclusion could be validated in more patients, more hospitals and more studies.</p><p>In conclusion, good effect and safety are obtained in both first-treated and re-treated patients when treatment regimens were determined based on the molecular pathologic antibiotic resistance, although more prospective studies are required. Compared with <italic>H. pylori</italic> culture and disc diffusion method, molecular pathological detection based on molecular markers is a very simple and economic approach which also takes less time, we hope that molecular pathologic antibiotic resistance could be used widely.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Ethics Approval and Informed Consent</title><p>The whole process of our research is in full compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and our research project was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health.
