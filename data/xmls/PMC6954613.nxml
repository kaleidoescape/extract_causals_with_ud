Widely available first-line treatments for obesity, such as dietary and other lifestyle interventions, typically have only short-term effects. Thus, new treatment approaches are needed. Novel interventions such as Attention Bias Modification Training (ABMT) and mindfulness-based interventions focus on modifying different maladaptive cognitive patterns typically present in people with obesity (e.g. attention bias to food cues); however, their mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. We describe the theoretical basis and the rationale for a study protocol of a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing two attention trainings (ABMT vs Mindfulness Training [MT]) in people with overweight or obesity. The aim of this study is to inform the development of a large-scale RCT in relation to acceptability and attendance rates and to identify preliminary evidence for the interventions&#x02019; clinical efficacy and potential underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p id="Par2">Forty-five adults who are either overweight or obese (minimum body mass index of 25&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) will be randomly allocated to receive eight sessions over eight weeks of either computerised ABMT or MT or be on a waiting list. Clinical and cognitive outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment (8&#x02009;weeks) and follow-up (12&#x02009;weeks post-randomisation). These include mood, body composition and attention biases. Credibility and acceptability of the trainings will be assessed using questionnaires, and recruitment and retention rates will be recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Findings will inform the feasibility of developing a large-scale RCT that takes into consideration effect sizes for primary outcome measures and the acceptability of the design.

Current treatments for obesity, based on dieting and lifestyle changes, typically have only short-term effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], presumably because there is little focus on pre-conscious and relatively automatic cognitive processes that may drive overeating in people with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Several studies have investigated the role of reward and of attention control in relation to food in people with obesity and/or binge eating disorder (BED), an eating disorder leading to (and often co-morbid with) obesity. These studies show enhanced reward sensitivity when participants are presented with food cues (both neurally and self-reported) and lower self-regulatory processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Relatedly, some studies have reported the presence of attention biases to food and other salient cues in obesity and BED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] presumably due to low attention control for highly rewarding stimuli (e.g. high-caloric food) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Attention biases (AB) occur when salient stimuli (e.g. food) capture a person&#x02019;s attention in comparison to neutral stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Research suggests that people with obesity and/or with BED tend to have AB towards food cues together with a difficulty in disengaging from these cues (as measured with eye-tracking techniques) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Importantly, gaze maintenance on food cues has been shown to contribute to food craving and to subsequent food consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and AB has been positively associated with body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Due to the potential role of AB in eating behaviour, treatment approaches aimed at modifying these biases have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">It has been proposed that AB can be targeted directly, using attention bias modification training (ABMT), a form of cognitive bias modification training. Specifically, ABMT has the potential for modifying attention processes towards salient cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These types of cognitive trainings hold the promise of an accessible treatment option due to their low cost and their potential for self-administration. Moreover, cognitive bias modification trainings, such as ABMT, target specific relatively automatic cognitive processes directly and do not, as in the case of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), rely on the patient&#x02019;s ability to consciously modify maladaptive pre-conscious cognitive processes such as AB.</p><p id="Par32">In the context of overeating, there is a growing body of research on the effects of ABMT. Some studies have focussed on using ABMT experimentally to investigate the potential (causal) role of cognitive processes associated with the onset/maintenance of eating and weight disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Others have started to test the clinical impact of ABMT as treatment for overeating tendencies. In these studies, different ABMT paradigms have been used, but the most commonly investigated is the dot-probe task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Even though results have been mixed, some studies using ABMT to modify food-related AB and eating behaviour have shown promising results. One meta-analysis reported a reduction in high-calorie food consumption (medium effect size) after training participants to look away from high-caloric food cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A second meta-analysis of the effects of different cognitive bias modification trainings (including ABMT) reported a medium effect size in modifying AB towards food cues in individuals with normal weight and with overweight/obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">In addition, a study using a single session of ABMT to train people with BED to look away from food cues found a significant reduction in subjective food craving after training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Relatedly, a feasibility open trial using eight weekly sessions of ABMT in people with overweight/obesity who binge eat reported encouraging results in reducing weight, eating disorder symptoms, binge eating and AB after training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To date, however, the mechanisms involved in the potential therapeutic effect of ABMT are not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Other attention-based treatment approaches, for example, mindfulness-based interventions, have also reported positive results in people with obesity and/or BED. They train participants to attend to the present moment in a non-judgmental manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This includes identifying internal cues of hunger/satiety and learning to control impulsive or automatic behaviours that could lead to overeating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT) of mindfulness-based interventions in people with overweight/obesity have reported post-intervention reductions in binge eating episodes and impulsive eating (large effect sizes) and increases in physical activity (small to medium effects), although the effect of mindfulness on body weight is less clear. In addition, medium effect sizes have been reported regarding improvements on symptoms of depression and anxiety after such interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, similarly to ABMT, there is little understanding of the underlying basis of the therapeutic effect of mindfulness-based interventions and, to date, no studies have measured the effects of these kind of interventions on food-related AB.</p><p id="Par36">To our knowledge, there have been no RCTs of ABMT in people with obesity or BED. Investigating the clinical potential of ABMT and comparing it with a more established attention training (i.e. a short mindfulness training [MT], for details see below) will shed light on the most appropriate treatment. Furthermore, comparing different types of attention trainings (i.e. MT vs ABMT) in people with obesity will contribute to our understanding of maladaptive cognitive patterns (i.e. AB) related to food craving and overconsumption in this population.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim and objectives</title><p id="Par37">The aim of this trial is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of two different attention trainings (i.e. ABMT and MT) with a waiting-list control group in people who are overweight or obese and to obtain important information for the development a future large-scale RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objective</title><p id="Par38">

Randomisation will be done by minimisation to control for BMI (obese/overweight) and gender (male/female). An independent researcher (not connected with the study) will perform the allocation using a computer programme for the generation of the random component. Allocation for balance between groups will be done manually and will be communicated via email to the researcher for each participant. Participants allocated to the waiting-list condition will be given the option to take the electronic version of the training of their choice (i.e. no randomisation process) once the waiting time is over.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Intervention conditions</title><p id="Par57">Participants assigned to either of the two intervention conditions will be asked to attend the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience eight times during an eight-week period (i.e. once/week). In addition, participants will be instructed to complete an Internet-based version of the allocated training every day for eight&#x02009;weeks at home (except for days when they have their weekly lab-based session).</p><p id="Par58">For every lab-based training session, participants from both conditions will be asked to choose between three high-calorie snacks. The chosen snack will be available to them to activate craving and reward/self-regulation cognitions during training. Visual analogue scales (VAS) for hunger and craving for the chosen snack will be assessed before and after the trainings to measure any potential changes. In addition, to minimise variability in hunger and satiety, participants will be requested not to eat or drink anything (apart from water) 2 h before each training. Before this window, they will be advised to have a light meal. To establish compliance, drink and food adherence for each training session will be recorded.</p><p id="Par59">Adherence to home sessions will be monitored via self-report (i.e. a training log) and through an output generated electronically at the time of each training. Other than these data on compliance, no further data from daily trainings will be collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Attention bias modification training</title><p id="Par60">The aim of the ABMT is to relatively implicitly train participants to &#x02018;look towards&#x02019; low-calorie food and &#x02018;look away&#x02019; from high-calorie food using a modified version of the anti-saccade task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], while eye movements will be recorded to assess participants&#x02019; training accuracy. For home sessions, participants will be given a tablet (Asus ZenPad 10) with a website version of the ABMT training to use for a daily 10-min session. Participants allocated to this condition will be asked to record their daily accuracy rate on the training.</p><p id="Par61">No side effects or risks of this type of training have been reported. However, because of the intense level of concentration required, participants could report fatigue. To minimise this, participants will be given small breaks (e.g. 2 min) between each block of the training (each training is formed by three blocks). We do not anticipate any other unintended effects of this training.</p><p id="Par62"><italic>ABMT training paradigm overview</italic>: This version of a modified anti-saccade task consists of 360 trials in total. Of these, 180 require participants to look towards low-calorie foods and 180 trials require participants to look away from high-calorie foods. For all trial types, a black fixation point appears for 100&#x02009;ms, followed by a red or blue fixation point for 500&#x02009;ms. A blue point indicates that a pro-saccadic eye movement is required (i.e. looking towards the food picture appearing after the fixation point), whereas a red point requires an anti-saccadic eye movement (i.e. to direct the gaze to the opposite side of the screen to where the picture appears). A blank screen gap is inserted for 200&#x02009;ms between fixation point and picture presentation to speed up subsequent reaction times (e.g. Kissler and Keil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]) and then a pictorial stimulus (high- or low-caloric food picture) appears on either the left or the right side of the screen for 500&#x02009;ms. Inter-trial interval is 1300&#x02009;ms. Trials will be presented in three blocks of each 120 trials.</p><p id="Par63"><italic>ABMT paradigm trial types</italic>: Low-calorie cues are always preceded by a blue dot (indicating that participants should perform a pro-saccade towards the stimulus) and high-calorie food cues are always preceded by a red dot (indicating that participants should perform an anti-saccade away from the stimulus).</p><p id="Par64"><italic>Stimuli:</italic> Participants will view 30 low-calorie food and 30 visually matched high-calorie pictures per block. The position of each picture is counterbalanced for the presentation on the screen side: each picture presented once on the left and right sides of the screen, resulting in the overall 360 training trials (30 food stimuli +&#x02009;30 non-food stimuli &#x000d7;&#x02009;2 positions &#x000d7;&#x02009;3 blocks). The order of trials will be randomised individually.</p><p id="Par65"><italic>Feedback:</italic> Response latencies are recorded during the task to monitor accuracy and provide participants with feedback. For each block, numbers of correct responses are summed up and presented as a&#x000a0;percentage score of correct performance to the participant (e.g. 70% correct performance).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Mindfulness training</title><p id="Par66">The app-based MT (provided by Headspace&#x000ae;) is 15&#x02009;min long and guides participants through a combination of breathing exercises focusing on the present moment. Participants allocated to this condition will be requested to sign a data privacy acknowledgement to authorise the company to share information with the study researchers at KCL.</p><p id="Par67">This type of intervention could trigger some anxiety in participants while they focus on the present moment.

However, the underlying mechanisms of these interventions are not well understood.</p><p id="Par110">Here we described a protocol for a feasibility trial comparing two different attention trainings (i.e. ABMT and MT, our form of mindfulness-based intervention) for people with obesity. This study will be informative for the development of future larger-scale RCTs investigating the potential clinical effects of these types of attention trainings. In addition, results from this study will contribute to our understanding of the importance of attention processes in relation to food cues and eating behaviour. Specifically, the role of attention biases to food in obesity-related behaviours such as food craving and overconsumption of food.</p><p id="Par111">While the aim of both ABMT and MT is to influence eating behaviour through the modification of attention processes, the focus of the training differs in terms of the aspect of attention that is being trained. ABMT has been developed to target AB to food in a relatively implicit way, presumably through strengthening attention control over attention allocation in the presence of food cues. In contrast, MT explicitly trains people to attend to the present moment (i.e. attention awareness) in a non-judgemental way. Investigating whether the clinical effects of both interventions are due to changes in&#x000a0;AB to food and/or changes in self-regulation and reward processes will contribute to our understanding of the mechanistic components of ABMT and mindfulness-based interventions.</p><p id="Par112">Potential challenges that this trial may face are related to recruitment and retention rates. Intervention length in studies using other mindfulness-based interventions in people with obesity is in the range of 4&#x02013;24&#x02009;weeks with good retention rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Even though ABMT interventions in people with obesity have been most commonly limited to one session only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], ABMT has been used for up to 10 sessions in studies for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and one feasibility study in people with obesity reported the use of ABMT for eight&#x02009;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, undertaking a daily home practice for eight&#x02009;weeks of either training entails a high level of commitment that could hinder recruitment and lead to high rates of attrition.</p><p id="Par113">In addition, participants allocated to the waiting-list condition might be discouraged due to the eight-week wait to receive a training. However, after the waiting period, they will have the option of choosing their preferred training. The opportunity to select an attention training as opposed to being randomly allocated to one, is likely to serve as motivation for waiting-list participants to continue as part of the trial.</p><p id="Par114">In summary, novel treatment approaches in obesity are needed to achieve longer-term success in maintaining a healthy body weight and eating habits. The investigation of cognitive interventions which target maladaptive biases and potentially influence eating behaviour are a promising route. This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of two different attention trainings in people with obesity and will shed light into their underpinning mechanisms and clinical potential. Results from this study will inform the design of larger RCTs aiming at investigating the efficacy of attention trainings and their potential to be implemented as adjunct treatment approaches for people with obesity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par115">Protocol version v.2.2 dated 18 October 2018.
