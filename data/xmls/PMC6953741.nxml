The authors of an accompanying <italic>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</italic> article concluded that &#x0201c;public health interventions to reduce prescription drug overdose must strike a balance between reducing misuse and abuse and safeguarding legitimate access to treatment.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In an effort to facilitate responsible prescribing of opioids, the CDC released guidelines for using these drugs for management of chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Unfortunately, these guidelines often have been misinterpreted and misapplied, thus increasing the risk of harm to patients.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Since the release of the Vital Signs report, serious deficits in practitioner knowledge of pain management, as well as of substance abuse, have been exposed.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This gap in practitioner knowledge may be due to inadequate exposure to these issues during predoctoral/preprofessional training. Several factors contribute to this educational shortcoming. First, the curricula in health science schools often lack a formal emphasis on pain management and substance use disorder (SUD). A 2011 descriptive study<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> found that a large number of US medical schools devoted fewer than 5 hours of course time to teaching pain management concepts, with a large percentage of those schools dedicating no time to these concepts. In addition, curricular time often was fragmented, with the few hours of education on pain management distributed across several different courses.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Associations of health profession education have responded to the opioid crisis by assessing what is being done in their respective curricula and providing association-level and nationwide guidelines and policies to educational initiations for curricular review and changes, which can result in revisions to accreditation standards. More recent data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) suggest that medical schools are making a renewed effort to address some of the aforementioned curricular gaps in pain and substance abuse education.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> For example, in response to a telephone survey of accredited medical schools, all surveyed curriculum deans (or their designees) reported that their school's curriculum addressed at least two of four identified pain and SUD domains. These results must be interpreted with caution, however, because only 102 of 147 accredited medical schools (69%) agreed to participate in the survey. It is possible that deans from schools with less comprehensive curricula may have been less willing to take part in this sort of assessment. Thus, the survey results may not accurately reflect the current status of medical school pain and SUD curricula. Moreover, even schools that include pain and SUD education in their curricula also reported continuing challenges to effectively teaching students about these two concepts. Some of the more frequently cited challenges were inadequate faculty development, time constraints, and imprecise assessment methods.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>The American Dental Education Association (ADEA) published a policy on academic dentistry's role in addressing the opioid epidemic by identifying prevention domains, compiling resources for educational institutions to use, providing specific suggestions for implementation, and setting efforts at three dental schools in Massachusetts as examples.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Moreover, in 2017, the Commission on Dental Accreditation's accreditation standard on local anesthesia and pain and anxiety control (Standard 2-24.e) was revised to include requirements regarding prescribing practices and SUD<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> prior to the policy's publication, and ADEA held a regional summit to address addiction education in dental curricula.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Currently, ADEA is conducting a nationwide mandatory survey related to the opioid crisis and substance abuse in dental education; the results have not been published yet.</p><p>The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) and American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) responded similarly to AAMC and ADEA. In 2018, AACN published several documents in response to the epidemic, providing details about what the association, and nursing education as a profession, had done so far in education related to opioid addiction and substance abuse and its commitment to help reverse the epidemic.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Similar to ADEA, AACN provided a compilation of resources to the professions.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In 2019, AACP provided an executive summary on the role of pharmacy education in responding to the opioid epidemic after surveying pharmacy schools on their curricular activities related to opioids. Similar to the response rate in medicine, 104 of 144 schools (72%) responded to the survey, reporting curricular and other activities in the areas of advocacy, education, service, practice, and research at pharmacy schools.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In all professions, guest editorials, curricular studies, and systematic reviews have been published on specific curricular implementations at individual institutions.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>In addition to profession-specific efforts, the opioid epidemic has called for action and collaboration across health professions. The Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) has worked together with profession-specific associations on programming to promote interprofessional collaboration to combat opioid addiction. These efforts include the 2018 SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) IPEC Addiction Education Interprofessional Summit, titled Enhancing Addiction Education Across the Health Professions,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and the USPHS (US Public Health Service) IPEC Award: ETSU (East Tennessee State University) Responds to the Opioid Epidemic webinar.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Interprofessional and profession-specific journals have disseminated studies on interprofessional curricular offerings and continuing education efforts related to opioids.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Although some specialized organizations provide guidance for interprofessional opioid curricula<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> or engage students in creating interprofessional team presentations,<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> interprofessional opioid initiatives within and beyond individual institutions are not well documented. The relative scarcity of interprofessional approaches to opioid education is reflective of the current state of interprofessional education more generally, where health professional students for the most part continue to learn in silos. However, new efforts are being made within each profession to assess and document interprofessional curricular status, effectiveness, efforts, initiatives, gaps, and challenges and to identify next steps.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Similar assessments are available from an overall health professional perspective<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and from an interdisciplinary specialty perspective.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>A limitation of current approaches to pain and SUD education is that the context in which students learn about these concepts does not map onto how they ultimately will put their learning into practice. Complexities of patient care, particularly those associated with the care of patients with SUD, require a team approach involving collaboration among numerous health professionals. Nevertheless, health professional students learn in silos and largely remain uninformed about the roles of other professions and the skills and knowledge they can contribute to patient care.<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> To prepare health professional students for interprofessional practice, it is necessary to equip them to identify the role of each profession within the team, how to utilize each effectively, and how to communicate within an interprofessional team.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, although health professional school curricular coverage of pain and SUD has improved in recent years, there remains a need for further enhancement and development of curricula in this domain. The National Institutes of Health Pain Consortium has responded to this gap in practitioner education by funding 11 health professional schools to be designated as Centers of Excellence in Pain Education (CoEPEs).<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Each center was charged with developing, evaluating, integrating, and promoting pain management curriculum resources for predoctoral/preprofessional students that could be disseminated for use by other health sciences educators nationwide. Collaborations among schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, health and rehabilitation sciences, and/or pharmacy were encouraged.</p><p>At the University of Pittsburgh CoEPE, eight case-based modules have been or are being developed, evaluated, and integrated during 2015-2020. Each module focuses on either a common pain syndrome or concept. The current educational module, completed by an interprofessional team in 2016, focuses on factors contributing to the opioid epidemic and how robust interprofessional communication plays a crucial role in avoiding common practitioner errors. In this case, a patient is prescribed an opiate analgesic after an outpatient procedure. The excess amount prescribed results in several adverse outcomes. The module emphasizes appropriate prescribing and monitoring of opioids and consequence of opioid misuse. The potential impact of this module is presented in three areas: (1) improve knowledge: increase awareness of opioid risks including abuse, diversion, overdose, and drug interactions; (2) change attitudes: engender attitudes in physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and patients that opioids are not the only treatment for acute pain and present drug and nondrug alternatives; and (3) gain skills: improve opioid prescribing for acute pain and improve opioid monitoring by pharmacists. This case highlights four core concepts: (1) managing acute perioperative pain, (2) maximizing opioid safety, and (3) identifying and (4) managing suspected opioid abuse and diversion. Additional emphasis is placed on the need for reliable and effective interprofessional communication, especially when faced with the operational barriers posed by a segmented health care system.</p><p>This report describes the implementation and evaluation of this module across three University of Pittsburgh health science schools. This project has been funded in whole or in part with federal funds from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSN271201500082C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s7"><title>Methods</title><p>The learning resource presented here is an online learning module featuring the case of Charlie, a teenager who recently had his wisdom teeth extracted and was provided an opiate analgesic by the oral surgeon.

We chose this platform for several reasons. First of all, online administration increased the flexibility of administration in that instructors had the option of assigning the module as either an in-class or homework activity. Because the module typically could be completed in about 1 hour, use in either setting was feasible. Second, the LMS allowed us to package the module so that all learning materials could be accessed from a single online location. Finally, LMSs&#x02019; support of adaptive release functions allowed for sequencing and controlling students&#x02019; access to each component of the module.</p><p>The pre- and posttest questions were used to assess the effectiveness of the video module in achieving the stated educational objectives across the three schools. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> presents a flow diagram describing the sequence of the module components.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram illustrating module adaptive release features.

Specific recommendations include second- or third-year medical and dental students, as well as medical, surgical, and dental residents; advanced undergraduate nursing students and first- and second-year nursing master's degree candidates; second-year physical therapy students; and third-year pharmacy students. Prior knowledge of basic pain physiology, in particular, is a suggested prerequisite for students to derive optimal benefit from the module. Recommended curricular settings would be the emergency dental medicine course for dental students, neurology or psychiatry course for pharmacy students, advanced pharmacology for nursing students, and ambulatory medicine/pediatric or family medicine clerkships for medical students.</p></sec><sec id="s7c"><title>Facilitator Prerequisite Knowledge</title><p>We also recommend that module facilitators be familiar with current thinking about the signs of drug-seeking patients, attitudes around suspected opioid abuse, and management of suspected opioid abuse within their profession-specific clinical setting (e.g., dental office, dental emergency room, general emergency department, outpatient settings, community setting). The instructor resources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s001">Appendix A</xref>) provide general background information about these topics and include several references for those who wish to further advance their knowledge of opioid-related issues. Instructors may also use the stand-alone content slides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s003">Appendix C</xref>) and the video transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s004">Appendix D</xref>) to increase their familiarity with the module prior to implementation.</p></sec><sec id="s7d"><title>University of Pittsburgh Implementations</title><p>We based our present report on pretest, posttest, and learner satisfaction survey data collected from three course implementations of the module at three different University of Pittsburgh health sciences schools.

The core concepts addressed by the module include management of acute perioperative pain, appropriate prescribing of controlled substances, and identification and triage of patients suspected of opioid abuse, diversion, or opioid use disorder. This holistic approach to the challenges associated with the use of opioid analgesics to manage perioperative pain addresses some of the gaps in health practitioner education on pain management and SUDs.</p><p>This module is unique in that it models interprofessional collaboration in the delivery of patient care. Much of the current literature on the appropriate use of opioids for pain management focuses primarily on the role of the prescriber.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Our module places equal emphasis on the role of the community pharmacist in educating patients about the proper use of opioids and about safety measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of opioid misuse. Furthermore, the module demonstrates how open communication between the prescriber and the pharmacist can aid in the early detection of opioid use disorders. This aspect of the module also complements existing resources that educate health professional students about how to manage patients with established SUD.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Finally, the module gives further breadth to the extant literature in that it focuses on pain management strategies in the acute care setting. Although chronic use of opioids is a recognized risk factor for eventual opioid misuse, so too is the initiation of short-term opioid treatment for acute pain, especially among adolescents.<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup></p><p>The overall improvement in student scores suggests that the module provides a meaningful learning experience for acquiring foundational knowledge and is applicable to several health care professions, namely, pharmacy, dentistry, and nursing. Post hoc analyses by profession revealed that the average improvement in scores was comparable across schools (data not shown), thus suggesting global applicability of the module. The positive results of the learner satisfaction survey suggest that students enjoyed the module and felt that it provided them with a valuable learning experience.</p><p>An advantage of the module is that it is flexible enough to be implemented as either an in-class activity or a homework assignment. Moreover, the interprofessional approach to the featured case permits incorporation of the module into the curricula of multiple health science schools. In the present report, we have discussed the results of implementations in the schools of pharmacy, dentistry, and nursing. In each setting, the module was supplemented with profession-specific evaluations that addressed relevant material presented in the module. While dental and pharmacy students completed a short quiz on the content specific to their profession, advanced nursing students were assigned a written assignment and were asked to compose a short essay addressing the opioid crisis as it pertains to the module, identifying a problem (diversion, interprofessional communication, patient education, etc.), and suggesting interventions, solutions, and the integration of new models and guidelines.</p><sec id="s9a"><title>Challenges Encountered</title><p>One frequently cited barrier to incorporating education on pain management and SUD into existing health sciences curricula is the challenge of making room for additional educational opportunities within an already demanding curriculum.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We faced this challenge as well when selecting courses in which to implement the module. Specifically, we needed to identify courses wherein (1) the content of the module was relevant, (2) the syllabus was sufficiently flexible to accommodate an additional assignment, and (3) the course was placed in the curriculum at a point when students already would have acquired prerequisite knowledge. We attempted to follow these guidelines when placing the module into each profession's curricula. For example, logistical issues necessitated our placing the School of Pharmacy implementation in the school's pulmonology/rheumatology course, which did not completely satisfy the relevance criterion but allowed the students to be exposed to the module at an appropriate point in their program of study. Because of this less than ideal curricular placement, it is possible that the value of the module to pharmacy students may have been underestimated. We see this and similar learning modules as contributions to a transformative curriculum to which we aspire when preparing health professionals for the 21st century&#x02014;moving from informative to formative to transformative learning.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> Learning modules like this one have the potential for the creation of personalized learning opportunities and just-in-time learning experiences to meet strategic initiatives and provide a means for educational institutions to work around and address barriers such as professional silos and moving away from traditional lectures.</p></sec><sec id="s9b"><title>Limitations and Future Directions</title><p>The following limitations need to be acknowledged regarding the data collection and results. Although overall response rates were high, students were able to opt out of having their pre- and posttest results, as well as learner satisfaction survey data, used for research purposes and by extension included in the present report. In addition, because responses to survey items were not forced, not every student provided responses to every survey item.</p><p>Even though students from all three schools appeared to benefit from the interprofessionally developed content of the module, their leaning experience was not truly interprofessional. Successful management of both pain and SUD requires collaboration among health care practitioners from multiple professions, with each contributing his or her specialized knowledge and skills to patient care. Because students completed the module within the context of their own profession, they did not have the opportunity to gain experience interacting with students from other professions and thus gain a greater appreciation for the advantages of interprofessional collaboration. Ideally, we would like to develop a learning experience wherein students from two or more professions can review and discuss the case together or a follow-up debriefing activity with students in an interprofessional setting.</p><p>Another limitation of our implementation and assessment of the learning module is that we did not evaluate clinical skills or changes in students&#x02019; attitudes toward or confidence in treating a patient with SUD. Implicit negative bias influences treatment plans for patients suffering from SUDs with or without a legitimate pain complaint,<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> and health science education currently places little emphasis on increasing students&#x02019; awareness of these biases and how to combat them. Some of the higher-level objectives set for this module are best suited to be assessed in a profession-specific content assessment using different assessment methods. In addition, in the future, we would like to either adapt this module or create a new one that addresses these implicit biases, assesses students&#x02019; awareness of them, and measures the extent to which these biases can be corrected to improve students&#x02019; attitudes toward treating patients with SUDs, as well as enhance their confidence in working with an interprofessional team to provide the best patient care.</p></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The module successfully addressed a curricular gap at the University of Pittsburgh health sciences schools, exposed students to issues related to opioid misuse from the perspective of various professions, and laid the foundation for additional curricular content on pain management and SUDs. The next step is to address the application of the knowledge gained from this module to actual patient care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s11"><title>Appendices</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ap01"><caption><p id="s001">A.
