We used linked population-based correctional and health administrative data. Of people released from Ontario prisons in 2010, we identified those with at least one medical or surgical hospitalization between 2005 and 2015 while they were in prison or within 6 months after release. For those with multiple eligible hospitalizations, we randomly selected one hospitalization. We stratified people by whether they were in prison or recently released from prison at the time of hospital discharge. We matched each person with a person in the general population based on age, sex, hospitalization case mix group, and hospital discharge year. Our primary outcome was 30-day hospital readmission. We included 262 hospitalizations for people in prison and 1,268 hospitalizations for people recently released from prison. Readmission rates were 7.7% (95%CI 4.4&#x02013;10.9) for people in prison and 6.9% (95%CI 5.5&#x02013;8.3) for people recently released from prison. Compared with matched people in the general population, the unadjusted HR was 0.72 (95%CI 0.41&#x02013;1.27) for people in prison and 0.78 (95%CI 0.60&#x02013;1.02) for people recently released from prison. Adjusted for baseline morbidity and social status, hospitalization characteristics, and post-discharge health care use, the HR for 30-day readmission was 0.74 (95%CI 0.40&#x02013;1.37) for people in prison and 0.48 (95%CI 0.36&#x02013;0.63) for people recently released from prison. In conclusion, people recently released from prison had relatively low rates of readmission. Research is needed to elucidate reasons for lower readmission to ensure care quality and access.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000241</institution-id><institution>Physicians' Services Incorporated Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15-22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6869-7516</contrib-id><name><surname>Kouyoumdjian</surname><given-names>Fiona G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>FK received funding from Physicians' Services Incorporated Foundation (15-22).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>We are not able to share data because of restrictions specified in our Research Agreement with the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services and in the data sharing agreements of ICES.

Readmission rates may reflect baseline morbidity, the development of new conditions or progression of chronic conditions, access to hospital care, inpatient mortality rates, and post-discharge mortality rates [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More commonly, however, an elevated rate of readmission is assessed as an indicator of deficiencies in quality of hospital care such as incomplete treatment, medical error, and inadequate discharge planning [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>People who experience imprisonment face a greater burden of illness on average compared to the rest of the general population, with a higher prevalence of infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and mental health and substance use disorders [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The period after release from prison is associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality, with several studies showing increased rates of medical-surgical hospitalization compared to the general population [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Health care access and quality may be suboptimal for this population while in prison and after prison release [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with substantial impacts on individual and population health [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In this context, the rate of medical-surgical hospital readmission among people who experience imprisonment in comparison with the rest of a population is an important indicator of the quality of hospital care. We aimed to compare 30-day readmission rates after medical-surgical hospital admission between people in prison, people recently released from prison, and matched people in the general population in Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>Population-based retrospective cohort study.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Setting</title><p>We conducted this study in the province of Ontario, Canada.</p><p>Provincial correctional facilities in Canada house people who are admitted to prison without sentencing or who are sentenced to less than two years in prison, as well as people sentenced to two years or longer prior to being transferred to a federal prison and those in temporary detention for other reasons [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In Ontario, provincial prisons are publicly funded and administered. We use the term &#x0201c;provincial prison&#x0201d; to represent all provincial correctional facilities, including jails, detention centres, and correctional centres. For Ontario residents, hospitalizations and medically necessary physician services including primary care and emergency department visits are paid for through the public health insurance system, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, including while in provincial prison.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Exposure group</title><p>We accessed data from the Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services on all adults who were released from provincial prison in 2010. As described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], these data were linked using unique encoded identifiers with health administrative data at ICES, an independent, non-profit organization funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, which houses health administrative data for Ontario residents.</p><p>We included all people in the prison group who were hospitalized for a medical or surgical reason during their time in provincial prison or in the 6 months after prison release, were alive on hospital discharge, and were Ontario Health Insurance Plan-eligible for 30 days post-discharge. We selected a 6-month follow-up period after release given our focus on opportunities to improve care in prison and at the time of release and evidence regarding discrimination at the time of prison release [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As health status and health care quality and access may vary substantially in prison and after release, we stratified people who had experienced imprisonment by whether they were discharged from hospital to prison or to the community into groups called <italic>people in prison</italic> and <italic>people recently released from prison</italic>.</p><p>We identified hospitalizations in the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstracts Database. We included only medical-surgical hospitalizations that were not related to pregnancy or psychiatric causes, as we hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying readmission to hospital for pregnancy and psychiatric reasons may differ. For the same reason, we excluded people who were readmitted for psychiatric or pregnancy reasons. For people in the prison groups who had more than one hospitalization during the follow-up period, we randomly selected one hospitalization as the index hospitalization in order to define the average risk of the outcome of readmission for any single hospitalization, rather than selecting the first or last hospitalization during the follow-up period.</p><p>We identified matched people in the general population from Ontario Health Insurance Plan-eligible people in the Registered Persons Database, which is a comprehensive registry of all people with current or prior Ontario Health Insurance Plan coverage [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We exactly matched each person in each of the two prison groups with one person in the general population based on sex, birth year, the year of discharge, and the case mix group for the index hospitalization, which indicates a person with similar clinical and heath resource use characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, we defined four exposure groups: people in prison, people in the general population matched to people in prison, people recently released from prison, and people in the general population matched to people recently released from prison.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Covariates</title><p>We selected indicators of patient socioeconomic status and morbidity, and inpatient and outpatient care, given the role of these factors in readmission and based on available data [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We examined age (median and interquartile range, IQR) and sex from the Registered Persons Database, and self-reported race from Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services data for those in the prison groups only, as data on race were not available for the general population. We accessed neighbourhood-level data on income quintile using the postal code from Registered Persons Database data at the time of prison release or at the time of hospital admission for people in the general population. We used the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Group System [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] with a two year look back to determine the number of Aggregated Diagnosis Groups (ADGs), which represent 32 diagnosis clusters that indicate the burden of morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; we calculated a summary score as the total number of clusters per person. We applied definitions from the Ontario Mental Health and Addictions Scorecard and Evaluation Framework to identify people with a diagnosis (yes/no) of mood disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and substance-related disorders, based on billings in the past two years in the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database, Discharge Abstracts Database, or the Canadian Institute for Health Information National Ambulatory Care Reporting System [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>We accessed data on length of stay in hospital in days and whether the patient left hospital against medical advice during the index hospitalization (yes/no) from the Discharge Abstracts Database. To examine access to care after hospital discharge, we accessed Ontario Health Insurance Plan data on primary care use (yes/no) and National Ambulatory Care Reporting System data on emergency department use (yes/no) in the 7 days after discharge, which could indicate appropriate post-discharge care or seeking care for unmet care needs, and in the 30 days after discharge.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Outcome</title><p><italic>A priori</italic>, we defined the primary outcome of interest as 30-day medical-surgical readmission to hospital. We selected the follow up period of 30 days given recent scientific and policy focus on this outcome, including as an indicator of quality of hospital care [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We identified readmissions in Discharge Abstracts Database data.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Sample size</title><p>In exploratory analyses as part of a larger project on health care utilization of people released from provincial prison in 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we identified 466 medical-surgical hospitalizations in women and 1,722 in men from 2005 to 2015 in prison or in the 6 months after release. Due to repeat hospitalizations and hospitalizations for pregnancy-related causes, we expected there would be fewer total people with medical-surgical hospitalizations not related to pregnancy. Based on a study of another marginalized population in Ontario: people who were homeless [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we expected that readmission rates would be as high as 22% for the prison group and 17% for the general population. Under those assumptions, we would have greater than 80% power to define readmission frequency for the prison group with a precision of 3% and 95% confidence with 733 people, and greater than 80% power to detect a difference in frequency of up to 5% with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 with 985 people in each exposure group.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Analyses</title><p>We compared people in prison and people recently released from prison, respectively, with general population controls across indicators of health status, socioeconomic status, inpatient care, and post-discharge care, using standardized differences, which are less sensitive to sample size than traditional hypothesis tests; we considered a difference of 10% meaningful [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We calculated the number and percent of deaths, admissions for pregnancy, and admissions for psychiatric reasons in the 30 days post-release in exposure groups, as these outcomes may compete with medical-surgical readmission.</p><p>We used the Kaplan-Meier method to calculate the frequency of readmission at 30 days after hospital discharge for each exposure group. We censored follow up at the earliest of death, readmission for psychiatric reasons, readmission for pregnancy reasons, or 30 days after hospital discharge [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We compared the risk of readmission at 30 days for people in prison and people recently released from prison, respectively, with people in the general population using stratified log-rank tests.</p><p>We assessed whether the proportional hazards assumption was met, and then used Cox survival analysis to assess the unadjusted association between imprisonment status and readmission. In adjusted models, we controlled for indicators of baseline health and socio-economic status (neighbourhood income quintile, ADGs), hospitalization (leaving against medical advice, length of stay), and post-discharge care (primary care and emergency department visits) to examine the residual effect of imprisonment status on readmission for people in prison and people recently released from prison, respectively, compared to the general population group.</p><p>We used SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.1 for matching and for all analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethics review</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (#4422). We accessed nominal data only for the purposes of data linkage. We did not obtain informed consent from participants, since the study met criteria for a waiver of consent as per the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which was approved by the Research Ethics Board.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><p>We identified 1,670 people who had 1 or more medical-surgical hospitalizations while in prison or in the 6 months after prison release.

We identified matches in the general population for 1,548 people: 262 of whom were discharged from hospital to prison, whom we called <italic>people in prison</italic>, and 1,286 of whom were discharged from hospital to the community, whom we called <italic>people recently released from prison</italic>.</p><p>People in prison and people recently released from prison were more likely than people in the general population to live in a neighbourhood in the lowest income quintile, and had greater morbidity at the time of the index hospitalization, as indicated by the median number of ADGs and certain mental disorder diagnoses (<xref rid="pone.0227588.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For people recently released from prison, a higher proportion left against medical advice in the index hospitalization compared with matched people in the general population.

This association persisted after controlling for socio-economic status, morbidity, hospitalization characteristics, and follow up care, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.48 for readmission. People in prison were 28% less likely to be readmitted to hospital than matched people in the general population- an absolute decrease of 3.1%- however, this difference was not statistically significant, including after adjustment for covariates in multivariable models.</p><p>This study has several strengths. We used population-based data for a large sample of people with current or recent imprisonment, and we matched on variables that would be strongly associated with readmission and that we did not want to explore. No prior study has examined readmission to hospital or important characteristics of hospitalization such as leaving hospital against medical advice for this population.</p><p>Potential study limitations are that we included only one hospitalization per person during the period of follow up because of methodological challenges in identifying controls that were matched on the basis of case mix group for each hospitalization. Depending on the patient&#x02019;s prior experience, any single hospitalization may in fact represent a readmission as opposed to an initial hospitalization. Since hospitalization occurs more frequently in people who experience imprisonment [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], readmissions may be overrepresented in people in prison and people recently released from prison compared to the general population group. The random selection of a single hospitalization allowed us, however, to define the average risk of the outcome of readmission for each hospitalization. As people who were in prison at the time of hospital discharge may have been released from prison over the 30 day follow up period and people who were recently released at the time of discharge may have been readmitted to prison during the 30 day follow up period, some people may have spent time in prison and in the community over the 30 day follow up period after hospital discharge. This may have contributed to exposure misclassification bias. Since we matched on case mix group, the general population groups were likely enriched for people who were more similar in terms of medical illnesses and risk behaviours compared to a general population group matched only on socio-demographic factors, for example, people with substance use disorders. In this way, to the extent that these factors impact readmission, we would expect less difference in outcomes between groups than if we had not matched based on case mix group. As there were only 262 people in the group of people in prison, analyses involving this group may not have had adequate power, so these results should be considered exploratory. Finally, given our use of administrative data rather than data collected data from patients, providers or charts, we were not able to define the reasons for readmission, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. to what extent readmission reflects inadequate care during the initial hospitalization, initial follow up on discharge from hospital, or patient-specific factors such as morbidity or behaviours.</p><p>The findings of our study largely agree with previous evidence regarding increased morbidity in this population [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While studies on other marginalized populations with increased morbidity and barriers to care access such as people who are homeless and people with developmental disabilities have identified higher rates of readmission to hospital [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we found no difference between rates of readmission for people in prison and we found decreased rates of readmission for people recently released from prison compared to the general population.</p><p>While the absolute difference in readmission rates between people recently released from prison and matched people in the general population was small, at 1.9%, we found the lower rate surprising; we had expected the readmission rate to be higher for people recently released from prison given evidence regarding their relatively high morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There are several potential explanations for the lower readmission rate in people recently released from prison compared with matched people in the general population. This population may be receiving better care in hospital and after hospital discharge. We found a similar length of stay in hospital (median of 3 days (IQR 1&#x02013;6) vs. 3 days (IQR 1&#x02013;5)) and a higher proportion of people who left against medical advice (9.5% vs. 3.8%); these data do not support the hypothesis of better inpatient care. People recently released from prison did not have higher rates of follow up with primary care in the week after hospital discharge (25.6% vs. 27.1%), and in fact, primary care use in people recently released from prison may be more likely to reflect use of specific services such as addictions clinics rather than generalist care, given the relatively high proportion of people in this group with substance-related disorders. Regarding morbidity and socio-economic status, those recently released from prison had a higher number of ADGs and a higher proportion of people in the lowest neighbourhood income quintile, and these factors are usually associated with increased readmission risk [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Competing outcomes such as death or hospital admission for psychiatric or pregnancy reasons were relatively uncommon, and would not explain the difference between groups. It is possible that people recently released from prison were able to get their needs met through primary care and ED encounters without needing admission, and ED visits after hospital discharge were more common in people who were recently released compared with matched people in the general population. Even after controlling for all these factors in multivariable models, however, the readmission risk remained significantly lower for people recently released from prison, though this may be due to not having adequately controlled for these variables or to additional factors related to imprisonment status.</p><p>Given increased emergency department visits, it is also possible that people recently released from prison had clinical indications for readmission, but either were not offered readmission or were offered but did not accept the offer of readmission. This is concerning, as it could indicate discrimination on the basis of legal status [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or on the basis of characteristics that are overrepresented in this population such as low socioeconomic status or mental illness. If people were choosing to not follow medical advice when they are acutely ill, this would also be problematic; deciding to not be admitted to hospital could reflect competing priorities such as the need to use substances, considering the high prevalence of substance use disorders and admissions for substance-use related conditions [<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227588.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227588.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>For people in prison, factors affecting readmission differ compared with both the general population and people recently released from prison. We found that people in prison had similar multimorbidity but a lower prevalence of mental illness compared with people recently released from prison, and greater multimorbidity and mental illness prevalence compared with the general population. Length of the index hospitalization was similar across groups, and the proportion that left against medical advice was similar between people in prison and the general population. In prison, policies and procedures affect health care access, for example the high proportion of people who accessed primary care (69.1% at 7 days post-discharge compared to 24.4% for people in the general population) likely reflects the policy of routine physician follow up in prison after hospital discharge, and health care providers and correctional officers in prison act as gatekeepers to people leaving prison to access the emergency department. Also, correctional officers accompany people in prison when they access care in the emergency department, which may affect health care provider and patient decisions regarding admission.</p><p>Further research is required to elucidate the experiences of people in prison and after prison release with hospitalization, and in particular to understand why rates of readmission are lower for people recently released from prison. Attention should be paid to barriers to hospital access on the provider or patient side, as well as to defining ways to optimize primary care and emergency department care to better meets the needs of this population. The events around visits to the emergency department, and the decision to admit or not to admit, might provide particular insights.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227588.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Most common case mix groups for the index hospitalization among prison group,* N = 1,548.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227588.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227588.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>STROBE statement.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227588.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Disclaimer: Parts of this material are based on data and/or information compiled and provided by the Canadian Institute for Health Information.

This is an important research question, as the released prisoners constitute an underserved population and because their health care use is not well understood. The manuscript relies on a large sample size with a sound methodology. However, there are some limitations that should be addressed.</p><p>Whole paper</p><p>1. The literature more commonly uses &#x0201c;emergency department visits&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;return to acute care&#x0201d;.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>2. I found the abstract very confusing at first read. I am afraid it is not readable as a stand-alone piece. It should be written more clearly. The results section is very long and the conclusions are almost absent. I did not understand the Methods at first read.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>3. The introduction is very short. There are some studies addressing health care (and use of emergency department) among (released) prisoners. This literature should be presented as well.</p><p>As it is not possible to understand the reasons of readmission or return to acute care, I suggest to avoid mentioning it at the first place in the Introduction.</p><p>Methods</p><p>4. The most important shortcoming is the presence of the incarcerated prisoners and the potential lack of power. The non-significant findings are not interpretable and there are important issues (prisoners possibly released). I suggest to remove this group from the sample and to focus on released prisoners and general population.</p><p>5. What about released prisoners who are reincarcerated within 6 months?</p><p>6. Using a random hospitalization appears as a limitation of the study design. The rationale for this choice instead of using the first hospitalization should be given.</p><p>7. Please add detailed information on variables assessed in the study.</p><p>8. Please also give a rationale for using a 30-day readmission or return to acute care cut-off.</p><p>Results</p><p>9. The 7-day outcome is mentioned for the first time p. 9 in the Results section. It should be included in the study&#x02019;s objective with its rationale and in the Methods section.</p><p>10. An important missed variable is the reason for hospitalization. It should be controlled for to achieve a better understanding of the results.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>11. Released prisoners are more likely to visit emergency departments in comparison with the general population. This may be because they have no GP, no information on their own health insurance, or no money to pay extra fees. It does not mean that they have worse outcomes after hospitalization. This should be discussed in the paper. Information on health care fees in the Canadian health care system should also be included.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This study is interesting for several reasons:</p><p>- large samples of people</p><p>- lack of data on care and hospitalizations for people in prison and after release</p><p>- comparison with the general population</p><p>However, for the method, why the 3 groups do not have the same number of people, since the objective was to compare them.</p><p>For the results, it is a little difficult to understand why there is such a difference between readmission and return to acute care. Information on the reasons for using non-hospitalized emergencies would deserve to be developed. Interpretation is possibly very much related to the functioning of the health care system in Ontario.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>- Line 62: abreviation &#x0201c;emergency department (ED)&#x0201d; already indicated line 46</p><p>Methods</p><p>- Line 84: define ICES</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
