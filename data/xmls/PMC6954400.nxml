The high resolution structure, solved by NMR-spectroscopy in solution, reveals binding features both common and different from the binding mode of other aptamers with affinity for ligands carrying planar aromatic ring systems such as the malachite green aptamer which binds to the tetramethylrhodamine related dye malachite green or the flavin mononucleotide aptamer.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id>SFB 902</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Austrian Science Foundation</named-content></funding-source><award-id>P28854</award-id><award-id>I3792</award-id><award-id>DK-MCD W1226</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Austrian Research Promotion Agency</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100004955</named-content></funding-source><award-id>864690</award-id><award-id>870454</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Integrative Metabolism Research Center Graz</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Austrian Science Fund</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100002428</named-content></funding-source><award-id>P28725</award-id><award-id>P30370</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA aptamers are artificially created RNA sequences able to bind to a wide variety of target ligand molecules with high affinity and specificity. At a time when only a few RNA structures were known and the idea that RNA could bind specifically to other molecules with widely different chemical characteristics was far from being generally accepted, these synthetic RNA molecules demonstrated the functional and structural potential of RNA. Aptamers are generated in a process first described almost 30 years ago which was termed SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In this procedure, large pools of random sequences are subjected to several rounds of affinity selection and subsequent amplification. Already the early examples for RNA aptamers showed that RNAs are capable of distinguishing even chemically and structurally closely related ligands and are able to bind their targets with a specificity rivalling those of antibodies. The structures of aptamer&#x02013;ligand complexes demonstrated for the first time that even small RNAs can fold into highly complex 3D structures. This is illustrated for instance by the structures of the ATP- (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>), FMN- (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and malachite green aptamer (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) bound to their respective ligands. These structures also provided a rationale for the impressive ligand specificity of these artificial molecules. Probably one of the most intriguing examples for ligand discrimination by an RNA is found in the theophylline binding aptamer (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This aptamer is able to discriminate against caffeine, a compound that differs from theophylline only by the presence of an additional methyl group, by &#x0223c;10&#x000a0;000-fold because the nitrogen-bound extra methyl group in caffeine sterically prevents the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the RNA (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Structural and functional investigations of an aptamer for the amino acid citrulline also showed how easy it can be for RNA molecules to gain new functions. Here, three point mutations of nucleotides directly involved in ligand binding were sufficient to create an aptamer with a new specificity for the amino acid arginine (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Similar observations were made for the ATP aptamer, which was evolved into a GTP binding aptamer by only a few point mutations (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Furthermore, extensive selection experiments for a given ligand revealed that there are often multiple solutions for the specific recognition of this ligand differing widely in sequence and structural features. An especially impressive example in this regard is the work of the Szostak group on GTP-binding aptamers (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref>). They identified as many as 11 sequentially and structurally distinct aptamer classes all binding to GTP with a wide range of affinities, different sets of recognition elements and different degrees of structural complexity. Only three classes of these aptamers have been structurally characterized so far (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>). However, each of these structures revealed unexpected motifs for ligand recognition such as an intermolecular G-quadruplex (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) or the presence of a base quartet containing a highly stable protonated adenine (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) that extended our insights into RNAs structural capabilities. Finally, structural studies on a number of different RNA aptamers showed that ligand binding leads to large structural and dynamical changes in the aptamer RNA. In most cases, the ligand free state of the aptamer was found to be highly dynamic with ligand binding inducing a transition to a well-ordered structure (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The properties of the synthetic RNA aptamers described above inspired the search for naturally occurring counterparts where these properties could be potentially harnessed for gene regulatory purposes. These naturally occurring counterparts where found in the early 2000s in the form of the so-called riboswitches which are regulatory elements in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs of bacterial mRNAs. In analogy to aptamers, riboswitches bind a wide variety of naturally occurring small metabolite molecules with high affinity and specificity (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and adopt highly intricate three-dimensional structures upon ligand binding (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Consequently, the ligand binding domains of riboswitches were termed aptamer domains. The often extensive ligand-induced structural and dynamical changes in the riboswitch aptamer domains are exploited to couple ligand binding to changes in gene expression by influencing either transcription or translation of the respective mRNAs. In analogy to previous observations on artificial aptamer families, it has been observed that for certain ligands such as SAM (<italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine), the modified nucleobase preQ<sub>1</sub> or guanidine multiple structurally and sequentially different riboswitch classes exist (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref>). These different riboswitch classes often vary widely in their ligand binding mode and specificity as well as in their structural complexity. Furthermore, in some cases riboswitch classes sensing structurally similar ligands differ only by a small number of mutations (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>) in their aptamer domains resembling the earlier observations for e.g. the arginine/citrulline aptamer pair (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and suggesting possible pathways for the evolution of novel gene regulatory elements.</p><p>The discovery of natural riboswitches in turn has inspired efforts to develop artificial aptamers for biorthogonal ligands into synthetic riboswitches (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) for the design of artificial gene regulatory circuits in synthetic biology applications. This approach was successful, e.g. for the theophylline aptamer, the tetracycline aptamer, the malachite green aptamer and the neomycin aptamer (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;34</xref>). However, no general rules for the design of artificial riboswitches from known aptamers could be established so far. A particularly illuminating example in this regard was the development of the neomycin riboswitch. The pool of neomycin aptamers obtained after only an <italic>in vitro</italic> SELEX is dominated by an RNA motif that binds with high affinity and specificity to neomycin but is not active as a riboswitch (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Only when the complete pool of aptamers was subjected to an additional <italic>in vivo</italic> screening an aptamer with riboswitch properties emerged (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> selected aptamers differ strongly in their structural and dynamic properties and are therefore particularly helpful in order to define determinants for riboswitch activity. Interestingly, the artificial neomycin riboswitch echoes the exceptional ligand discrimination capabilities of the theophylline aptamer since it is triggered by neomycin but not by the closely related paromomycin which differs from neomycin only by the exchange of a single amino group with a hydroxyl group. High resolution structures of the neomycin riboswitch in complex with both aminoglycosides show that the replacement of a single functional group results in the loss of several intramolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions followed by a general dynamic destabilization of the non-cognate ligand complex (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In general, the development of synthetic riboswitches requires aptamer/ligand pairs where the aptamer is structurally rather unstable in its apo form and binds its target with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> in the nanomolar range in the presence of limited Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations and a bio-orthogonal ligand that is not toxic and is either easily taken up by the cell or able to penetrate cell membranes.</p><p>In order to extend the number of options of aptamer/ligand pairs for the development of potential RNA-based gene regulatory elements that fulfill these conditions Carothers <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> used SELEX in the presence of low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to create a series of four aptamers that bind to the xanthene dye tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). TMR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) is a cell permeable red-coloured dye with an absorption maximum at 535 nm which emits fluorescent light in the green-yellow region of the spectrum with an emission maximum at 573 nm. The aptamer TMR3 from the series of TMR-aptamers is reported to be the structurally most complex and information-rich aptamer (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) containing three predicted helical regions (P1&#x02013;3) connected by three formally single-stranded junctions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Sixteen of the 20 nucleotides in these predicted junction regions were found to be completely invariant. Three nucleotides vary between two bases and only one nucleotide is completely variable. The TMR3 aptamer binds its ligand TMR with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> in the high nM range and efficiently quenches its fluorescence emission (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The tetramethylrhodamine binding aptamer 3 (TMR3).

The structure of the TMR3/ligand complex reveals that ligand binding induces the formation of a stable three-way junction stabilized by Watson-Crick as well as by non-Watson-Crick pyrimidine-pyrimidine and purine-purine mismatch base pairs. The ligand stacks between a base triple closing helix P1 and a platform formed by consecutive G:A and G:G mismatches extending helix P3 and forms specific hydrogen bonds and polar interactions in the binding pocket. Some features of the TMR binding pocket in our structure are reminiscent of the binding sites for planar aromatic ligands observed in other aptamer/ligand complexes. Interestingly, while ligand binding to the wild-type TMR3 aptamer leads to fluorescence quenching, structure-based mutations in the ligand binding pocket significantly reduce the quenching of the TMR fluorescence without affecting ligand affinity. Furthermore, the extensive structural changes induced by ligand binding suggest that TMR3 might indeed by a good candidate for the development of artificial riboswitches with fluorescent properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>TMR3 RNAs were prepared by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription with T7 RNA polymerase using linearized plasmid DNA as templates in general as described (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).

All remaining experiments were recorded at 25&#x000b0;C. To establish base pairing patterns, the [<sup>15</sup>N]-sample was used to obtain a standard 2D HNN-COSY spectrum as well as a selective long range (sellr)-HNN-COSY spectrum starting from the adenine H2 spins with a subsequent selective long-range transfer to the adenine N1 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In addition, a 2D HNN-COSY spectrum starting on the amino groups served to confirm the identity of the base pairing partners in the G&#x02013;C base pairs. All HNN-COSY spectra were recorded at 900 MHz. To derive the geometry of the U8&#x02013;U23 base pair from the carbonyl chemical shifts, a 2D H(N)CO spectrum was recorded at 600 MHz (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The N-CO transfer delay was set to 8.3 ms in this experiment. 3D <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C NOESY-HSQC spectra were obtained for the aromatic C-H moieties on the [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]- and the [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-Gua, Ura labeled samples at 25&#x000b0;C and 950 MHz. A 2D F<sub>1</sub>,F<sub>2</sub>-filtered NOESY was acquired on the [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-sample at 600 MHz to obtain intraligand NOEs. In addition, a 3D <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C NOESY-HSQC for the aliphatic C-H moieties was recorded on this as well as on the [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-Ade sample employing gradient coherence selection and sensitivity enhancement at 950 MHz mainly to collect and resolve NOEs between the ribose moieties and the pyrimidine H5 atoms and the imino and amino hydrogens. The [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]- and the selectively labeled [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-Ade, Cyt and [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-Gua, Ura samples were subsequently exchanged into 100% D<sub>2</sub>O by repeated lyophilization and dissolution in D<sub>2</sub>O. Subsequently, aliphatic 3D <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C NOESY-HSQC spectra were acquired for the two selectively labelled samples at the 950 MHz spectrometer and for the [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N] sample at 900 MHz. On the [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-sample a 3D F1-<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N-filtered <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C NOESY-HSQC was recorded on the 900 MHz spectrometer to obtain intermolecular NOEs between the RNA and the unlabeled ligand. In addition, {<sup>1</sup>H},<sup>13</sup>C hetNOE spectra for the aromatic and anomeric C&#x02013;H moieties were recorded on the uniformly labeled sample at 600 MHz. These experiments were run in duplicates in an interleaved manner with 5 s of hydrogen saturation and a recycling delay of 3 s. NMR data were recorded and processed using Bruker TOPSPIN software. Cara was used for spectra analysis (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-5"><title>Input restraints and structure calculation</title><p>Resonance assignment for the TMR3/5-TAMRA complex was achieved by standard procedures as described in detail previously (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Based on this resonance assignment, NOE peak intensities were extracted from the various NOESY spectra and translated into five groups of upper distance restraints (&#x0003c;2.8, 3.5, 4.3, 5.8 and 6.5 &#x000c5;). Distance calibration was performed in reference to the averaged intensity of the H5&#x02013;H6 cross peaks of pyrimidine residues in stable base pairs, which were set to 2.4 &#x000c5; in the 3D <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C aromatic NOESY-HSQC spectrum recorded on the [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-sample. This calibration was transferred to all other NOESY spectra. In case of the <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>1</sup>H NOESY, a sixth class of even longer upper limit restraints of &#x0003c;7.5 &#x000c5; due to the very high sensitivity of this experiment was introduced. Hydrogen bonding patterns obtained from the HNN-COSY spectra were incorporated by inclusion of two upper and two lower limit restraints, one between the donor hydrogen and the acceptor heteronucleus (2.0&#x000a0;and 1.8 &#x000c5;) and one between the two heteronuclei (3.0 A and 2.8 A). Consequently, confirmed standard Watson&#x02013;Crick G&#x02013;C base pairs were constrained by three such constraint pairs, standard Watson&#x02013;Crick A&#x02013;U base pairs by two. The Watson&#x02013;Crick G26&#x02013;A39 base pair was constraint by distance restraints between the G imino group and the N1 of the adenine as well as the G O6 and the A N6 amino group. Hydrogen bonds that were consistently present based on the angles and distances of the donor and acceptor groups for the majority of the 100 calculated structures in the course of the calculations were also introduced as additional distance constraints in the final round of structure calculations. Accordingly, hydrogen bonds between the G25 imino and amino groups as well as the G40 amino group and the ligand I<sub>5</sub> carboxylate group as well as the G25 C6 carbonyl and the G40 amino group were identified and introduced. The geometry of the non-canonical base pair between U8 and U23 was established from the <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts of the C2 and C4 carbons in the 2D H(N)CO experiment (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). It was restrained by two hydrogen bonds between the U8 C4 carbonyl and the U23 N3 imino group and the U8 imino and the U23 C2 carbonyl group. The GAAA tetraloop topping stem P2 (G14 to A17) folds into a canonical GNRA tetraloop. Therefore, the hydrogen bonds typical for this fold were introduced between the A17 N6 amino group and the G14 N3, the G14 amino group and the A17 N7 and between the G14 amino and the A16 phosphate moiety. Similarly, the UUCG tetraloop in P3 (U31 to G34) adopts a canonical UNCG tetraloop fold and was restrained by hydrogen bonds between the U31 C2 carbonyl group and both the G34 imino and amino group. Additionally, hydrogen bonding restraints were introduced between U31 2&#x02032;OH and the G34 C6 carbonyl group and the C33 N4 amino group and the U32 phosphate group as well as the C33 2&#x02032;OH group and its own C2 carbonyl group. In addition, backbone as well as glycosidic torsion angles of the non-flexible loop residues G14 and U31, C33 and G34 were restricted to values extracted from published high resolution tetraloop structures (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The ribose puckers of all residues in canonical base pairs with the exception of G41, U42 and C44 were restricted to C3&#x02032;-endo. Canonical coordinates derived for residues for which the aliphatic carbons were resolved, suggest C2&#x02032;-endo ribose conformations for U24, G41, U42, A43, while C44 shows a can<sub>1</sub> value in agreement with an averaged ribose pucker (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Accordingly, U24, G41 and U42 were restricted to C2&#x02032;-endo and the ribose pucker of C44 was left unrestricted. In the case of A43 NOE data did not agree with one single conformation and two different structures were calculated for this residue (A43<sub>WC</sub> and A43<sub>HS</sub>, see below). The ribose pucker of A43 was restricted to C2&#x02032;-endo in the A43<sub>WC</sub> conformation, while it was set to C3&#x02032;-endo in the A43<sub>HS</sub> conformation. The glycosidic torsion angle of this residue appeared consistently as <italic>syn</italic> in the structure calculation of both conformers and was restricted accordingly in the final rounds of structure calculations. The backbone torsion angles as well as the glycosidic torsion angles of all canonical A-form residues were set to canonical values with a variance of &#x000b1;20&#x000b0;.</p><p>Structure calculation was carried out in CYANA. A total of 100 structures was calculated with 32&#x000a0;000 simulated annealing steps per conformer comprising 12&#x000a0;000 high temperature steps of torsion angle molecular dynamics followed by 20&#x000a0;000 steps of slow cooling and 8000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="SEC3"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="SEC3-1"><title>TMR3 construct optimization</title><p>The tetramethylrhodamine aptamer 3 (TMR3) identified in a SELEX effort by Carothers <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> is an RNA of 54 nucleotides (nt). In this selection experiment, Carothers and co-workers explicitly aimed at obtaining aptamers capable of ligand binding at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Accordingly, dissociation constants for tetramethylrhodamine (TMR, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) of 370 nM at 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 400 nM at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration were originally reported that showed already a negligible effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration on ligand affinity. We measured the affinity of TMR3 for TMR in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and in the presence of 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) and found it to be independent of the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and even slightly higher than reported previously (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 353 nM at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 233 nM in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, respectively). Consequently, all subsequent NMR-experiments were carried out in the buffer described by Carothers <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (see Material and Methods) in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>The TMR3 aptamer was predicted to fold into an open three-way junction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) comprising a closing stem (P1) and two short hairpins (P2 and P3) connected by stretches of 5&#x02013;8 formally single stranded residues. The short 3 base pair containing hairpin P2 is closed by a canonical GNRA tetraloop with a GAAA sequence and a C&#x02013;G closing base pair. P3 is topped by a canonical cUUCGg tetraloop. The originally predicted secondary structure of free TMR3 suggested the presence of 13 Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs (11 G&#x02013;C and 2 A&#x02013;U base pairs). However, initial spectra of the free wt-RNA immediately showed that already in the absence of the ligand more Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs than originally predicted are present. Imino group signals corresponding to 11 Watson&#x02013;Crick G&#x02013;C and 4 WC A&#x02013;U base pairs as well as the typical imino group signals for the G residues in the GAAA and UUCG tetraloops were observable in the <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum of the free wt-RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>1</sup>H NOESY data (data not shown) suggests that already in the free TMR3 RNA P2 is actually extended by two G&#x02013;C and two A&#x02013;U base pairs compared to the original prediction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Upon addition of 5-carboxy tetramethylrhodamine (5-TAMRA, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), the commercially available TMR analogue used in the original SELEX procedure, most of the resonances of free TMR3 are retained, in particular those of the two canonical tetraloops (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In addition, a number of new resonances appear in spectral regions characteristic for both canonical and non-canonical base pairs. Based on distance information from <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>1</sup>H NOESY data for imino protons stems P1, P2 and P3 contain at least 6, 7 and 4 consecutive Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs, respectively, in the RNA&#x02013;ligand complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The presence of extended stem regions not directly involved in ligand binding prompted us to devise a minimized TMR3 variant of only 48 nt length, which lacks one G&#x02013;C base pair in P1 and two G&#x02013;C base pairs in P2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This minimized aptamer (TMR3_48nt) shows a <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum similar to the wt-RNA both for the free RNA and when bound to 5-TAMRA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Importantly, in the spectrum of the TMR3_48nt/5-TAMRA-complex the imino resonances corresponding to non-canonical hydrogen bonding interactions associated with 5-TAMRA binding to the wt aptamer are retained and only resonances for three canonical G&#x02013;C base pairs are missing, indicating that TMR3_48nt adopts a structure very similar to the wt RNA. In addition, fluorescence titrations show that the ligand affinity of TMR3_48nt is only reduced slightly (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 516&#x000b1;16 nM) compared to the wt (233&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6 nM, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Initial structural data obtained from <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra together with <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>1</sup>H NOESY distance information verifies the presence of three stems coming together to form a closed three-way junction which forms the ligand binding site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>). In order to profit from improved spectral resolution of the smaller RNA&#x02013;ligand complex, we proceeded with the structure determination of the TMR3&#x02013;ligand complex by NMR using the minimized TMR3_48nt aptamer.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>TMR3 construct optimization and initial structure characterization.

</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In contrast to the prediction, stem P1 does not form only a five base pair canonical helix but a helix with seven continuously stacked Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs. A43 is extruded from P1 and thereby enables uninterrupted stacking between the G5:C44 and the A6:U42 base pair. However, the A6:U42 base pair is less stable compared to other A:U base pairs in the molecule due to its vicinity to the bulged out A43 as judged from its imino signal line width and temperature dependence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The low intensity of this resonance prevented the characterization of the base pairing of this residue by standard experiments. However, the Watson&#x02013;Crick geometry of the A6:U42 base pair was unambiguously established in a selective long-range (sellr) HNN-COSY experiment starting on the non-exchangeable H2 of A6 where the signature correlation across the N - - H&#x02013;N type hydrogen bond between the A6 N1 and the U42 N3 was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>P2 and P3 form the expected stem-loop structures topped by a canonical GAAA and a canonical UUCG tetraloop, respectively, but are extended by non-Watson-Crick base pairs at the opposite ends. P3 is extended towards the three-way junction by an additional <italic>trans</italic> Watson&#x02013;Crick/Watson&#x02013;Crick G26:A39 and a <italic>trans</italic> Watson&#x02013;Crick/Watson&#x02013;Crick G25:G40 base pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, right). The geometry of the Watson&#x02013;Crick G26:A39 base pair was also verified in the sellr HNN-COSY experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The G25:G40 base pair is stabilized by one intra-RNA hydrogen bond between the O6 of G25 and the amino group of G40. The presence of this two non-canonical base pairs at the end of P3 pointing towards the three-way junction leads to a gradual increase of the P3 helix diameter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). P2 is extended by a <italic>trans</italic> Watson&#x02013;Crick/Watson&#x02013;Crick U8:U23 base pair stabilized by two direct hydrogen bonds. While U24 remains formally unpaired it is stably stacked on top of the U8:U23 base pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, left). Its imino proton is protected from exchange with the solvent and it shows an extended network of NOEs to the ligand as well as to the U8:U23 base pair (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). The two individual stem&#x02013;loops are very well converged. This is reflected in an average heavy atom RMSD from the mean structure for P2 (residues 9&#x02013;24) of 0.28 &#x000c5; and a heavy atom RMSD for P3 (residues 25&#x02013;40) of only 0.20 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>Due to the extended helices of P1, P2 and P3 in the ligand bound RNA the junctions between the three helical stems are very short. In each case they consist of only one phosphodiester group. Consequently, the orientation of the three helical stems in the three-way junction with respect to each other is structurally very well defined. The ligand 5-TAMRA mediates continuous helical stacking between P1 and P3. P2 is oriented perpendicular relative to the coaxially stacked P1 and P3 stems and to the extended three-ring aromatic system of the ligand. The very dense network of intramolecular and intermolecular NOE distance constraints spanning the junction region is sufficient to precisely define the conformation of the three-way junction even without the inclusion of additional long range structural restraints such as RDCs into the structure calculation. However, we performed additional SAXS experiments on TMR3_48nt and the TMR3_48nt/5-TAMRA complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). The SAXS data demonstrate that TMR3_48nt undergoes only a slight global structural rearrangement including an overall compaction upon 5-TAMRA binding as indicated by the similar Kratky plots, pairwise distance distributions, maximal dimensions (60/55 &#x000c5;) and radii of gyration (19/19 &#x000c5;). Importantly, the general triangular shape of the TMR3/5-TAMRA complex and the resulting relative orientation of the three stems with regard to each other as obtained from the NMR NOE data was confirmed by the SAXS measurements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>The ligand binding pocket</title><p>The ligand binding pocket of TMR3 is lined by the C7:G41 Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair closing stem P1, the <italic>trans</italic> WC/WC G25:G40 base pair of P3 and the unpaired U24 closing stem P2. 5-TAMRA intercalates with its planar xanthene ring system between the C7:G41 base pair of P1 and the G25:G40 base pair of P3 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In particular, the large three-ring xanthene moiety of the ligand is involved in extensive stacking interactions with the G25:G40 base pair. Ring I of 5-TAMRA is tilted by an angle of &#x0223c;113&#x000b0; relative to its xanthene moiety and protrudes into the minor groove of the aptamer RNA. The carboxylate group at position I<sub>5</sub> (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), which is also part of the cognate ligand TMR, is oriented in the direction of the G25:G40 base pair such that it can form hydrogen bonding interactions with both residues. Both the amino and the imino group of G25 as well as the amino group of G40 are in the appropriate distance and orientation to form hydrogen bonds to the I<sub>5</sub> carboxylate group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, right). 5-TAMRA intercalation into the RNA between the two consecutive residues G40 (P3) and G41 (P1) is facilitated by the C2&#x02032;-endo conformation of the G41 ribose moiety. This increases the inter-residue distance between G40 and G41 (C1&#x02032;&#x02013;C1&#x02032; distance of 7.72&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.01 &#x000c5;) which leaves enough room for the xanthene moiety of the ligand to intercalate. Furthermore, one of the positively charged dimethyl amino groups of the ligand is oriented towards the phosphate backbone group connecting G40 and G41 suggesting a favorable electrostatic interaction between the RNA and the ligand at this position.</p><p>Ligand stacking with the C7:G41 base pair at the terminus of the P1 stem is further extended by the formation of a dynamic base triple involving this base pair and the looped-out A43. {<sup>13</sup>C},<sup>1</sup>H-hetNOE data of residues in the TMR binding site demonstrate that for A43 both the nucleobase and the ribose moiety show increased flexibility while all other binding site residues are rigid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). However, although A43 appears to be conformationally dynamic, apparently its presence contributes to ligand binding since its deletion results in a &#x0223c;2.5-fold decrease of the binding affinity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). A detailed analysis of the NOE data observed for H2 and H8 of A43 reveals distance restraints which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously in one single conformation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). An illustrative example for this is the simultaneous presence of NOE cross peaks for A43 H2 to both U42 H5&#x02032; and C44 H4&#x02032;. To solve this conformational ambiguity, H2 and H8 NOEs of A43 were manually sorted to agree to two different conformations of A43. Starting from the most severe mutually exclusive NOEs, NOE derived upper limit restraints agreeing more with the one or the other conformation were incorporated into two separate structure calculation procedures in a stepwise fashion. A number of distance restraints fulfilled in both resulting sub-structures were included in both calculations, while others with significant distance differences in the two sub-structures were only introduced into the structure with the shorter inter-proton distance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This procedure resulted in two sub-structures which together explain all observed NOE cross peaks. In both sub-structures the A43 nucleobase is oriented in a potential minor groove base triplet with the WC C7:G41 base pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In one conformation (A43<sub>WC,</sub> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> left), A43 is oriented with its Watson&#x02013;Crick edge towards C7:G41 such that A43 N1 can form a hydrogen bond with G41 N2H22 and A43 N6H61 can form a hydrogen bond with C7 O2. This conformation of the A43 nucleobase is in good agreement with a C2&#x02032;-endo sugar pucker and the nucleobase in a <italic>syn</italic> conformation. In the other conformation (A43<sub>HS</sub>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, right) the N7 of the Hoogsteen edge of A43 can interact with the G41 N2H22 and the A43 amino group forms a hydrogen bond to the O2 of C7. A C3&#x02032;-endo ribose pucker is preferably adopted in this conformation together with a glycosidic bond in a <italic>syn</italic> conformation. The proposed difference in ribose pucker of the two conformations agrees well both with the observed elevated {<sup>13</sup>C},<sup>1</sup>H-hetNOE value for the A43 C1&#x02032; and the averaged canonical coordinates (<italic>can1</italic> = &#x02013;6.34) for this ribose moiety (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The difference between the A43 nucleobase and ribose conformation in the two sub-structures results in a local difference in the backbone conformation between residues G41 and C44 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). However, the global structures are similar with an RMSD between the lowest energy structures of the A43<sub>WC</sub> and the A43<sub>HS</sub> conformer of 0.95 &#x000c5;. Our detailed structural analysis of the two A43 conformers suggests that in both cases two hydrogen bonds are formed to the C7:G41 base pair resulting in roughly the same contribution to the stabilization of the TMR3/5-TAMRA complex and rationalizing the presence of these two A43 conformations in the structural ensemble of the complex. For both conformers, the A43 nucleobase forms a T-shaped stacking interaction with the aromatic ring I of 5-TAMRA. Together, hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions provide an explanation for the decrease in binding affinity upon A43 deletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Conformational equilibrium of A43.

The U8 phosphate group and its ribose moiety thus get in close proximity to the ribose moiety of G25 at the base of P3 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, left). In principle, a hydrogen bond could be present between the 2&#x02032;OH of G25 and the U8 phosphate group to stabilize the local arrangement. However, the heavy atom distance between the hydroxyl group and either the 5&#x02032;-bridging or either of the two non-bridging phosphate oxygens in the NMR structures is &#x0223c;4.1 and 4.2 &#x000c5;, respectively, and thus too long by &#x0223c;1 &#x000c5; for a hydrogen bond. Hydroxyl group protons protected against fast exchange with the solvent by hydrogen bonding interactions should be observable in long-range <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C-HSQC spectra due to correlations with the ribose C2&#x02032; and C3&#x02032; carbons. However, no such correlation was observed in this experiment for the G25 2&#x02032;OH group. In addition, no correlation was observed between any exchangeable hydrogen and a phosphate resonance in <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>31</sup>P-HMQC spectra with long transfer delays optimized to detect hydrogen bonds (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p><p>The base of P2 is formed by an unpaired uridine residue, U24, which stacks between the U8:U23 base pair and a ligand dimethyl amino group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, left). The imino proton resonance of this residue is comparatively narrow suggesting protection from exchange with the solvent by either hydrogen bonding or steric exclusion. In the NMR structure the only hydrogen bonding acceptor group in the vicinity of the U24 H3N3 group is the non-bridging OP2 phosphate oxygen of C7 in a distance of &#x0223c;4.5 &#x000c5;. The imino hydrogen chemical shift of 10.8 ppm for U24 is in good agreement with a phosphate group as hydrogen bonding acceptor (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) but also for an imino proton protected from exchange due to burial in a hydrophobic environment (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), e.g. due to the spatial proximity to the hydrophobic ligand. In agreement with the latter possibility, no <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>31</sup>P-correlation across a potential hydrogen bond was detected. Notably, the C2 carbonyl group of U24 and the phosphate group of U8 are located within a distance of &#x0223c;4 &#x000c5; of the positively charged nitrogen of the dimethyl amino group from the ligand, suggesting that electrostatic interactions between these moieties further contributes to ligand recognition.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>TMR3 &#x02013; a minimized xanthene binding site</title><p>The TMR3 aptamer binds 5-TAMRA with an affinity in the high nanomolar range due to the intercalation of the planar xanthene moiety of the ligand between a large purine:purine base pair on one side and a dynamic base triple on the other side. Specific hydrogen bonding interactions are formed between the RNA and the I<sub>5</sub> carboxylate group with possible additional contributions from electrostatic interactions between the positively charged dimethyl amino groups of the ligand and the phosphate backbone between G40 and G41 as well as with the U8 phosphate and the U24 C2 carbonyl group. The binding site of TMR3 shares similarities with other known aptamers. For instance, the FMN aptamer accommodates the extended three-ring aromatic xanthene moiety of the ligand in its binding site by extending the diameter of a helix with a Watson&#x02013;Crick G&#x02013;A base pair followed by a G&#x02013;G base pair of the same geometry as the G26:A38 and G25:G40 base pairs in TMR3, suggesting a common stacking motif for extended aromatic ring systems (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Another aptamer which is structurally related to TMR3 is the malachite green aptamer (MG-aptamer). While originally selected to bind to the fluorescent triarylmethyl dye malachite green (MG, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, top), this aptamer also forms a tight complex with MG&#x02019;s xanthene derivative <italic>N,N&#x02019;</italic>-tetramethyl-rosamine (TMS; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, bottom). In fact, due to its rigid scaffold, TMS surpasses the affinity of MG to the MG-aptamer by a factor of &#x0223c;20 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &#x0223c;40 nM versus 800 nM) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It thus binds &#x0223c;10-fold more tightly to the MG-aptamer than 5-TAMRA to the TMR3-aptamer although compared to 5-TAMRA it lacks the carboxylate group on ring I as potential interaction partner with the RNA. Interestingly, despite its structural similarity to 5-TAMRA, MG does not show any affinity to TMR3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Comparison to the structure of the malachite green aptamer.

Representation as described in D.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkz1113fig5"/></fig><p>The structure of the MG-aptamer in complex with TMS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">E</xref>) solved by X-ray crystallography reveals some interesting similarities to the TMR3/5-TAMRA complex regarding the intercalation of the ligand between the closing stem P1 and a coaxially stacking stem&#x02013;loop P3 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Furthermore, one side of the TMS binding site core is formed by two consecutive residues where one of the dimethyl amino groups of the ligand interacts electrostatically with the phosphate group connecting these two residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). This is structurally very similar to the intercalation of 5-TAMRA between residues G40 and G41 in the TMR3 complex. On the opposite end the binding site is closed by a uridine in a U-turn structure, which is oriented perpendicular to the aromatic plane of the ligand. The U-turn uridine closes the binding pocket by an interaction with a backbone phosphate group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). This resembles the orientation of U24 in our TMR3 complex structure towards the backbone phosphate group of C7 and to the dimethyl amino group of the ligand. Therefore, the U-turn of the MG-aptamer could be considered as an equivalent of the P2 stem in the TMR3 complex structure. Interestingly, while the floor of the TMS binding site is formed by a G:C WC base pair as in the TMR3-aptamer, its top consists of a G&#x02013;G&#x02013;C base triplet (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) compared to the extended G:G base pair in TMR3. Remarkably, one of the G-residues (G29) in the base triplet occupies the position of the I<sub>5</sub> carboxylate group of 5-TAMRA. In turn, ring I of TMS is involved in a base stacking sandwich with an adenine base moiety and a ribose moiety (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Despite the higher binding affinity compared to the TMR3/5-TAMRA complex no specific hydrogen bonding interactions between ligand functional groups and the RNA can be found stabilizing the MG-aptamer/TMS complex. Instead, the higher affinity of the MG-aptamer/TMS interaction apparently originates from additional ligand induced RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Thus, the extended binding site reveals additional base pairing and stacking interactions, such as a ligand induced long range A:A stacking interaction which is extended by stacking on ring I of TMS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Extensive ligand induced RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions are also a feature of other RNA&#x02013;ligand complexes resulting in high ligand affinity despite a sometimes limited number of direct specific RNA&#x02013;ligand interactions. One very striking example in this regard are the aptamer domains of the purine sensing riboswitches, where ligand binding stabilizes long-range loop&#x02013;loop kissing interactions distant to the binding site (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The network of ligand induced RNA-RNA interactions, however, appears to be more limited in the case of the TMR3 aptamer and might therefore explain the lower affinity to its ligand in comparison to the MG-aptamer. TMR3 can be thus seen as a &#x02018;minimal&#x02019; binding motif for TMR.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Potential of TMR3/5-TAMRA as a synthetic riboswitch</title><p>Comparison of the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra of the free and 5-TAMRA bound TMR3_48nt aptamer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8A</xref>) shows, that in the spectrum of the free RNA a number of imino proton signals is missing compared to the spectrum of the ligand bound RNA. This indicates an increased exchange with the bulk solvent and less stable or absent base pairing in the free RNA. Missing for instance are the imino proton signals for U8 and U23 which form a U:U base pair and for U24 in P2 as well as for G25 of the G25:A40 base pair and for G26 and G41 of the G25:G41 base pair extending P3. Also unobservable are the imino protons for G41 of the C7:G41 base pair and U42 of the A6:U42 base pair in P1. All these nucleotides are in the direct vicinity of the ligand binding site suggesting that the core of the 3-way junction is conformationally unstable in the free RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Thus, 5-TAMRA binding induces an extension of all three helices by stabilizing canonical and non-canonical base pairings enabling uninterrupted ligand-mediated stacking between P1 and P3 and thereby a stable structure of the otherwise dynamic and open three-way junction of the free TMR3 aptamer with all residues except A43 in a stable structural arrangement in the ligand bound state. Ligand binding thus brings the three otherwise structurally independent stem regions together and couples their stability. In this ligand mediated stability coupling, the TMR3/5-TAMRA system displays the functional characteristics observed in other natural as well as synthetic riboswitches (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The ligand dependent structural changes accompanied by the formation of a continuously stabilized co-axially stacking P1-P3 stem of 13 base pairs suggests that TMR3 might be a suitable candidate for the generation of a synthetic riboswitch with functional characteristics analogous to the neomycin riboswitch in yeast. This synthetic riboswitch acts on the translational level by forming a ligand-stabilized road block for the scanning small ribosomal subunit when bound to neomycin (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) whereas the unstable structure of the free form of the synthetic riboswitch can be dissolved by the small ribosomal subunit. Systematic studies on the synthetic neomycin riboswitch have shown that the minimum stem length, which cannot be dissolved by the scanning small ribosomal subunit is &#x0223c;9 consecutive base pairs (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Free TMR3 features 4&#x02013;5 base pairs in its three unconnected stems and 13 bp of the continuous P1-P3 stem in its ligand bound state and therefore seems to be well suited as a synthetic riboswitch in this respect. The three-way junctional architecture of TMR3 with ligand binding in the core of the junction also leaves the size and composition of the individual stems variable for optimization with regard to their relative stabilities.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Stem P2 is a determinant for TMR3 fluorescence quenching efficiency</title><p>5-TAMRA is a strongly fluorescent dye used frequently as a fluorescence label. Fluorescent RNA aptamer/ligand complexes have attracted significant interest in the recent past, as they harbor great potential for <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA visualization efforts (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56&#x02013;58</xref>). In general, fluorogenic RNA aptamers such as Spinach (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) or Mango (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) induce the fluorescence of otherwise non-fluorescent ligands by rigidifying their conformation in the RNA-bound state. Interestingly, the TMR3 aptamer quenches the fluorescence of 5-TAMRA almost completely in the bound state (96&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.7%). In contrast, the MG-aptamer has the opposite effect on the conformationally flexible MG, which is virtually non-fluorescent in the free form and lights up upon binding to the MG-aptamer showing a &#x0223c;2000-fold increase in fluorescence brightness upon binding (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). This dramatic gain in fluorescence intensity has been attributed to the loss in flexibility upon intercalation of MG into the binding site, leaving fluorescence as the only pathway for energy dissipation after excitation. Considering the partial similarity of the MG- and the TMR3&#x02013;aptamer binding sites, their different effect on ligand fluorescence is surprising. In order to test determinants for fluorescence quenching, we generated several binding site mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Deletion of A43 in the base triple below the bound ligand has only a moderate effect on affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 1.24 &#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.07 &#x003bc;M versus 516&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;14 nM of the wt, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) and almost no effect on fluorescence quenching efficiency (91&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3%). In contrast, deletion of U24 at the base of P2, has a similarly moderate effect on affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 1.17&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.21 &#x003bc;M), while fluorescence quenching is significantly reduced to only 46&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Moreover, the imino proton NMR spectrum shows that the relevant binding features are retained for the &#x00394;U24 mutant, while in the case of a &#x00394;P2 mutant with a completely deleted P2 stem (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), only correct folding by virtue of the present UUCG tetraloop resonances can be verified but no indication of ligand binding is found (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Thus, the interaction of the base at the P2 stem with the dimethyl amino group of 5-TAMRA appears to constitute a major determinant for fluorescence quenching by the RNA. This first step towards a RNA/5-TAMRA complex which retains the fluorescence of the ligand suggests that a fluorescence optimized variant of TMR3 could form a light-up RNA/ligand complex with a 5-carboxyl analogue of MG.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Variation of P2 influences fluorescence properties of TMR3.
