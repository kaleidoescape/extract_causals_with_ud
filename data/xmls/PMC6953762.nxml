A Core Outcome Set (COS) is the minimum set of outcomes that should be reported by a research study within a specific disease area. There is significant heterogeneity in outcome reporting for CES, which does not allow data synthesis between studies. The hypothesis is that a COS for CES can be developed for future research studies using patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) as key stakeholders.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>Qualitative semi-structured interviews with CES patients were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using NVivo to identify the outcomes of importance. These were combined with the outcomes obtained from a published systematic literature review of CES patients. The outcomes were grouped into a list of 37, for rating through two rounds of an international Delphi survey according to pre-set criteria. The Delphi survey had an overall response rate of 63% and included 172 participants (104 patients, 68 HCPs) from 14 countries who completed both rounds. Thirteen outcomes reached consensus at the end of the Delphi survey and there was no attrition bias detected. The results were discussed at an international consensus meeting attended by 34 key stakeholders (16 patients and 18 HCPs) from 8 countries. A further three outcomes were agreed to be included. There was no selection bias detected at the consensus meeting.

The incidence of CES is 2 per 100,000 and is an indication for emergency decompression surgery [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Inadequate management and poor outcomes in CES may result in a high medico-legal burden[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. CES is commonly categorised into CES incomplete (CESI) and the more severe presentation of CES complete with urinary retention (CESR)[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There is little in the literature regarding long term prognosis[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and a review of studies evaluating treatments for CES demonstrated heterogeneity in the outcome domains measured [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, the outcomes reported in the literature have not been independently validated as important by key stakeholders. A Core Outcome Set (COS) is &#x0201c;an agreed, standardised set of outcomes to be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all trials for that particular health area&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The concept of a COS was developed to standardise outcomes across all relevant trials to allow comparisons of the results of different trials in a given condition [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><sec id="sec005"><title>Objectives</title><p>This paper reports the consensus process which was undertaken with key stakeholders (patients and healthcare professionals [HCPs]) to achieve the Cauda Equina Syndrome Core Outcome Set (CESCOS). A systematic literature review and qualitative interviews were conducted to identify a complete list of outcomes. These outcomes populated a two-round Delphi survey, which participants completed and reviewed at a consensus meeting. Key stakeholders identified the most important outcomes but the group did not intend to validate how to measure these outcomes in this study. This study is reported in accordance with the Core Outcome Set-STAndards for Reporting (COS-STAR)[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Scope</title><p>The health condition included all severities of CES.

All were adults aged over 18 years and able to independently complete an online questionnaire in English. Participants were recruited from a database at the local site, through snowball sampling [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] of known contacts and through international and national HCP and patient organisations.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Information sources</title><p>A published systematic literature review (SLR) [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] identified all the outcomes documented in studies since 1990 involving patients who had undergone surgery for CES. The outcomes from the SLR were combined with the outcomes identified from the qualitative interviews to form those initially rated on within the Delphi Survey. These qualitative interviews had been conducted by NS with 22 patients treated at The Walton Centre between 2007 and 2016 for CES. A sampling frame was applied to ensure patients with a range of CES severities (CESI or CESR) and different times since the operation were interviewed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a topic guide (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225907.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>) and involved patients&#x02019; describing their experience of CES in a chronological manner to ascertain the relevant outcomes and the lived experience of the condition. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and with the assistance of NVivo (version 10), were coded using an inductive approach to identify outcomes. NS led the analysis process and was supported by AN.</p><p>The SLR produced 737 verbatim outcome terms and the qualitative interviews identified 260. The qualitative interviews highlighted 43 verbatim outcome terms not identified by the literature review, which were more concerned with life impact. There was a total of 997 verbatim outcome terms, which was condensed by the study team to 37 outcomes. These were categorised into five higher order categories as per the taxonomy recommended by COMET (Clinical Outcomes, Life Impact, Resources Use, Death and Adverse Events) [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The process of reducing the &#x0201c;long list&#x0201d; to a &#x0201c;short list&#x0201d; of outcomes was reviewed by the study team including patient research partners for face validity, understanding and acceptability and modified according to feedback. For example, regarding low back pain there were 53 verbatim outcome terms from the SLR (n = 31) and the qualitative interviews (n = 22) but these were all summarised to one outcome of low back pain. In addition, the terminology and explanations of the outcomes were decided using the language from the patient interviews and refined through a series of cognitive &#x0201c;think aloud&#x0201d; interviews conducted with HCPs and patient representatives [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225907.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Consensus process</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Delphi survey</title><p>The &#x0201c;modified&#x0201d; Delphi method [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was used with outcomes derived from the SLR and interviews. Additional outcomes were suggested in round 1 by participants. Demographic details were collected on the registration page. The Delphi survey was anonymised and only participants who responded to the first round of the Delphi were invited to participate in the second round.

The HCPs incorrectly assumed that since the outcome of global quality of life was in the COS then low mood and depression would be automatically included in this outcome. The facilitator highlighted that all quality of life measurements would not measure the same outcomes and if participants wanted an outcome related to quality of life to be included they had to vote it in. After adequate discussion, a re-vote was agreed by the study team, which resulted in the outcome of low mood and depression being included. The outcome of death was deemed to be already covered by the outcome of complications and the study team agreed to include this in the definition of complications hence it was not voted on.</p><p>Foot drop, back pain and need for further intervention were voted as critically important by patients but not by HCPs. Low back pain was not voted critically important by HCPs as they felt it was due to several different causes so to ascribe it to CES would be incorrect. With regards to foot drop this was not included as HCPs and some patients felt the outcome of mobility and walking would encompass the effects experienced by foot drop. HCPs felt the need for further intervention was already included within the outcome of complications. They also felt further procedures related to the management of CES would say little regarding the effectiveness of the initial intervention for CES.</p><p>The &#x0201c;no consensus&#x0201d; outcomes which were critically important by &#x0003c;70% of participants from both stakeholder groups in the Delphi survey were agreed by the consensus meeting participants to not be voted on and to accept the results of the Delphi; Sexual desire, constipation, sensation in the legs, urinary urgency and abdominal pain. Fatigue although in this category was requested by the patient stakeholder group to be voted on again. Other outcomes already included in the COS were contributory to fatigue such as mobility and walking, ability to do daily activities and leg muscle strength and this was cited as a reason by a HCP and patient as not choosing it critically important. It did not reach the criteria for inclusion in the COS.</p><p>The feedback for the consensus meeting was completed by 13 out of 16 patients (81%) and 16 out of 18 HCPs (89%).

It was registered on the COMET database and a transparent process has been used involving an international Delphi survey and consensus meeting to decide the COS. Each outcome included has been scored and agreed as critical by at least 70% of patients and 70% of HCPs. This COS is recommended for use in any research study investigating CES outcomes as they have been verified as important by key stakeholders. This will allow evidence synthesis in CES.</p><p>It is noted that the numbers recruited in a Delphi survey can potentially be small if the condition is rare[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A review of COS studies from the COMET database revealed that 22% had recruited patients from 5 or more countries [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Inclusion of patients from multiple countries is deemed more difficult than HCPs [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The CESCOS study recruited 172 participants for both rounds and involved patients from 8 countries and HCPs from 12 countries. Participants from the UK made up 55% and 45% were international of who most were patients. CES is a rare condition so this was deemed to be a satisfactory response.</p><p>For the CESCOS Delphi, HCPs (82%) had a better response rate compared to the patients (55%) in round 2. This may be a reflection that most HCPs were recruited from professional organisations and patients were recruited openly from social media[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The importance of completing both rounds of the Delphi may not have been emphasised enough through social media. However, there was no attrition bias detected in the results of the CESCOS study.</p><p>Most HCPs taking part in the Delphi were of a surgical background and 63% had 10 years or more experience after board certification as a consultant/ attending or the equivalent. This is reflective of current CES management and research as it is managed as an acute condition requiring emergency intervention in most cases[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225907.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225907.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Fifty percent patients were in the age group of 30 to 49 and 52% of patients were not in employment or retired. This reflects that CES adversely affects a working age population. Eighty-nine percent of patients had an operation for CES and this is consistent with the main aetiology for CES being a compressive pathology which requires surgical decompression[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225907.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As mentioned in the results, over half of the HCPs attending the consensus meeting were involved in acute management and the rest involved in longer term care and rehabilitation of CES patients, which would be reflective of a group of HCPs that manage CES patients in the short and long term from diagnosis. There was an equal spread of patients in the years since CES diagnosis, which would have also facilitated prioritisation of short and long term outcomes.</p><p>In Round 1, a higher proportion of HCPs scored autonomic related outcomes (urinary retention, incontinence of urine, faecal incontinence and physical ability to have sexual intercourse) as critically important compared to patients. Outcomes scored higher by patients in Round 1 included genital sensation and life impact outcomes such as global quality of life, ability to do daily activities and mobility and walking. This agrees with the literature where HCPs prioritise clinical outcomes compared to those related to life impact, which patients find important. This was also reflected at an earlier stage when the verbatim outcome terms, which were mentioned in the qualitative interviews and not in the SLR were mainly related to life impact. There is evidence which suggests that patients tend to rate many or all outcome domains as important in prioritisation exercises so HCP views would dominate as the outcome domains they do not deem important will not be included in the final COS [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This was observed for ten outcomes in the CES Delphi survey where &#x02265;70% of patients voted them critical but HCPs had not therefore excluding them from the core outcome set at this stage (<bold><xref rid="pone.0225907.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>). These outcomes were sensation of bladder fullness, anal tone, foot drop, low back pain, leg pain, difficulty with body posture, anxiety, isolation, low mood and depression and hospital resources. The outcome of anal tone, which has been measured in CES research studies[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225907.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] is used as a proxy for faecal incontinence. However, anal tone was not voted into the COS but faecal incontinence was, which highlights the importance of not just measuring what clinicians believe is important.</p><p>Multiple group feedback between rounds has been shown to improve consensus between stakeholder groups[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The CESCOS used this feedback method and found most HCPs (58.4%) and some patients (27.6%) made score changes based on the feedback from the stakeholder groups. This led to consensus on 13 outcomes to be included and 6 to be excluded at the end of the Delphi survey. No participation bias was seen with the participants who attended the consensus meeting.</p><p>A prospective study of long term outcomes after surgery for 46 CES patients had a mean follow up of 43 months[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Validated questionnaires and unvalidated semi structured interviews were used to assess long term outcomes of bladder, bowel, sexual and physical function. Not all the outcomes in the CESCOS have been measured. For example, perineal sensation, sensation in genitals, leg muscle strength, pain due to abnormal sensation or non-painful stimulus and complications from the operation, were not measured. For the outcomes that were measured, there has not been a transparent consensus process[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] regarding the choice of these outcome measurement instruments. In <xref rid="pone.0225907.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> of a systematic literature review[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], it was shown that between studies, there is a lack of uniformity in the assessments used for the outcomes in CES, which makes it difficult to synthesise the results for meaningful analysis. The CESCOS highlights the outcomes for which this process must be undertaken in a transparent and methodologically sound manner.</p><p>There is little research into the uptake of core outcome sets in comparison to randomised trials and systematic reviews as there are a relatively smaller number of them[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A review of the rheumatoid arthritis COS established in 1994 showed that 81% of trials between 2002 and 2016 were reporting it[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Implementation is an important aspect to help promote uptake and to aid this the CESCOS is registered on the COMET database, is published and will be presented at meetings and relevant HCP, patient and research funding bodies will be informed.</p><p>In the qualitative interviews, Delphi survey and consensus meeting for the CESCOS study, patients were keen and willing to be involved. This may be a reflection that it is a rare syndrome so any attention or further research for the condition is actively engaged and welcomed by them suggesting the burden of data collection is not an issue with this patient group. A study reviewing the long-term outcomes after spinal surgery for CES showed that there was a real need for HCPs to spend sufficient time discussing the difficult issues and delivering prognostic information to patients regarding their outcomes[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This highlights the importance of recording and reporting the CESCOS outcomes for future research studies. Currently, a multicentre prospective observational cohort study in CES is using the CESCOS[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] for its follow up data collection. The pragmatic difficulties of data measurement will be explored here. The COS should be reviewed in the future to see if any outcomes need to be added or subtracted[<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The aim is to do this in five years to analyse uptake in CES research studies.</p><sec id="sec030"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A varied sample was obtained for the qualitative interviews using a sampling frame, which identified outcomes important to patients. The Delphi survey recruited participants from 14 countries and the consensus meeting recruited participants from 8 countries, which is significant considering CES is a rare condition. The consensus process successfully involved both patient and HCPs in the prioritisation of outcomes and agreement over the COS.</p><p>The study was only conducted in the English language due to time and budget resource limitation. During the Delphi survey, details of how patients presented with CES were not collated as it would not have been possible to verify these details with the respective medical notes within the time limitations of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec031"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have determined 16 outcomes that are critical to key stakeholders (<bold><xref rid="pone.0225907.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref></bold>). In the medical literature, there is a focus on the bladder dysfunction and clinical sequelae of CES [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There is little emphasis on outcomes related to life impact. This COS has highlighted the importance of all these outcomes to be assessed as the &#x0201c;minimum standard.&#x0201d; To ensure consistency in measurement and reporting of these outcomes the next stage will involve gaining consensus around standardised definitions and recommended measurement instruments for each outcome in the COS following the COSMIN-COMET guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0225907.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec032"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0225907.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Topic guide for the qualitative interviews.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0225907.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0225907.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Patient and HCP organisations that circulated the Delphi.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0225907.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0225907.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>List of outcomes with their associated plain language and clinical explanations used for the Delphi.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0225907.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>CES consensus meeting collaborators (Healthcare professionals and Patients) who attended and participated in the consensus meeting include:</p><p><bold>Healthcare professionals:</bold> Charles Davis, Fadel Derry, Canisius Dzapasi, Michael G Fehlings, Paulo Roberto Franceschini, Brian J C Freeman, Elizabeth Heaps, Radek Kaiser, Rafid Al-Mahfoudh, Siva Nair, Tim Pigott, Zaid Sarsam, Helen Smith, Bakulesh Soni, Marco Teli, Christos Tolias, Laura Whitfiled, S L Yadav</p><p><bold>Patients:</bold> Paul Chapman, Ann Derbyshire, Natalie Falconer, Darren Hayden, Barry Kirby, Patricia Knight, Billy Maskell, Pat Mason, Mark Paine, Julie Pearson, Amanda Proctor, Claire Rawlings, Steven Smith, Anja Tribler, Claire Thornber, John Robert Whitehead</p><p>Special thanks to Claire Thornber and Steven Smith for their role as patient representatives on the study team.

Discussion:</p><p>- appropriate discussion of the consensus group composition.</p><p>- the authors have omitted to cite a recent study (perhaps because this was published after the present study's submission) which seemingly reported the largest cohort of patients with CES investigated for long-term outcomes using validated questionnaires. Please discuss the findings and choice of questionnaires used, and how your COS might improve this. [Hazelwood JE et al.

In the patient group, there was an equal spread of patients in the years since diagnosis of CES (&#x0003c;2: 5, &#x02265;2&#x0003c;5: 4, &#x02265;5&#x0003c;10: 6 and &#x02265;10: 1).&#x0201d;</p><p>This was added in the discussion:</p><p>&#x0201c;As mentioned in the results, over half of the HCPs attending the consensus meeting were involved in acute management and the rest involved in longer term care and rehabilitation of CES patients, which would be reflective of a group of HCPs that manage CES patients in the short and long term from diagnosis. There was an equal spread of patients in the years since CES diagnosis, which would have also facilitated prioritisation of short and long term outcomes.&#x0201d;</p><p>- the authors have omitted to cite a recent study (perhaps because this was published after the present study's submission) which seemingly reported the largest cohort of patients with CES investigated for long-term outcomes using validated questionnaires. Please discuss the findings and choice of questionnaires used, and how your COS might improve this. [Hazelwood JE et al. An assessment of patient-reported long-term outcomes following surgery for cauda equina syndrome. Acta Neurochir (Wien). 2019 Sep;161(9):1887-1894. doi: 10.1007/s00701-019-03973-7. Epub 2019 Jul 1.]</p><p>Thank you for bringing us to the attention of this study. This has now been referenced in the discussion:</p><p>&#x0201c;A prospective study of long term outcomes after surgery for 46 CES patients had a mean follow up of 43 months. Validated questionnaires and unvalidated semi structured interviews were used to assess long term outcomes of bladder, bowel, sexual and physical function. Not all the outcomes in the CESCOS have been measured. For example, perineal sensation, sensation in genitals, leg muscle strength, pain due to abnormal sensation or non-painful stimulus and complications from the operation, were not measured. For the outcomes that were measured, there has not been a transparent consensus process(2) regarding the choice of these outcome measurement instruments. In Table 5 of a systematic literature review(3), it was shown that between studies, there is a lack of uniformity in the assessments used for the outcomes in CES, which makes it difficult to synthesise the results for meaningful analysis. The CESCOS highlights the outcomes for which this process must be undertaken in a transparent and methodologically sound manner.&#x0201d;</p><p>References</p><p>Prinsen CA, Vohra S, Rose MR, Boers M, Tugwell P, Clarke M, Williamson PR, Terwee CB.

A review of the rheumatoid arthritis COS established in 1994 showed that 81% of trials between 2002 and 2016 were reporting it (5). Implementation is an important aspect to help promote uptake and to aid this the CESCOS is registered on the COMET database, is published and will be presented at meetings and relevant HCP, patient and research funding bodies will be informed. </p><p>In the qualitative interviews, Delphi survey and consensus meeting for the CESCOS study, patients were keen and willing to be involved. This may be a reflection that it is a rare syndrome so any attention or further research for the condition is actively engaged and welcomed by them suggesting the burden of data collection is not an issue with this patient group. A study reviewing the long-term outcomes after spinal surgery for CES showed that there was a real need for HCPs to spend sufficient time discussing the difficult issues and delivering prognostic information to patients regarding their outcomes(6). This highlights the importance of recording and reporting the CESCOS outcomes for future research studies. Currently, a multicentre prospective observational cohort study in CES is using the CESCOS(7) for its follow up data collection. The pragmatic difficulties of data measurement will be explored here. The COS should be reviewed in the future to see if any outcomes need to be added or subtracted(19). The aim is to do this in five years to analyse uptake in CES research studies. </p><p>References</p><p>Kirkham JJ, Clarke M, Williamson PR.
