Since genomic occupancy of a TF is highly dynamic, it is crucial to study TF binding sites (TFBSs) in a cell-specific context. To date, thousands of ChIP-seq datasets have portrayed the genomic binding landscapes of numerous TFs in different cell types. Although these datasets can be browsed <italic>via</italic> several platforms, tools that can operate on that data flow are still lacking. Here, we introduce TFregulomeR (https://github.com/benoukraflab/TFregulomeR), an R-library linked to an up-to-date compendium of cistrome and methylome datasets, implemented with functionalities that facilitate integrative analyses. In particular, TFregulomeR enables the characterization of TF binding partners and cell-specific TFBSs, along with the study of TF&#x02019;s functions in the context of different partnerships and DNA methylation levels. We demonstrated that TFs&#x02019; target gene ontologies can differ notably depending on their partners and, by re-analyzing well characterized TFs, we brought to light that numerous leucine zipper TFBSs derived from ChIP-seq experiments documented in current databases were inadequately characterized, due to the fact that their position weight matrices were assembled using a mixture of homodimer and heterodimer binding sites. Altogether, analyses of context-specific transcription regulation with TFregulomeR foster our understanding of regulatory network-dependent TF functions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Research Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001321</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Medical Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001349</named-content></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/BNIG/2035/2015</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Canada Research Chairs</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001804</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Institut Fran&#x000e7;ais &#x000e0; Singapour</named-content></funding-source><award-id>6.10.14</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">RNA Biology Center</named-content></funding-source><award-id>MOE2014-T3-1-006</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund</named-content></funding-source><award-id>T1-2012</award-id><award-id>T1-2016</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription factors (TFs) are the key components that regulate spatiotemporal gene transcription (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Aberrant TF activities result in gene dysregulation, which is associated with several disorders such as cancer (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A TF usually recognizes a 3&#x02013;15 bp DNA sequence, <italic>e.g</italic>. 3 bp for c-JUN monomer (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and 15 bp for CTCF (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), within proximal (promoter) or distal (enhancer) <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. In the past decades, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> techniques have been established to uncover TF sequence binding preferences. Protein-binding microarray (PBM) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) are widely adopted <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches to identify TF binding sites (TFBSs) in high-throughput scales (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, although these methods have uncovered the DNA binding motifs for thousands of TFs, the characterization of TFBS on a naked DNA environment neglects key <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions that influence binding sites, such as chromatin structure, TF cooperativity and DNA modification, and thus may reveal only one facet of TF&#x02013;DNA interaction (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The current gold standard method to determine <italic>in vivo</italic> TF binding sequences is chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This technique allows to enrich chromatin fragments that interact with a TF of interest and, with the help of <italic>in silico</italic> procedures, compute a DNA binding motif (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Nonetheless, these chromatin fragments usually cover &#x0223c;100&#x02013;500 bp, while the actual TFBS size ranges from 3&#x02013;15 bp, which challenges the depiction of the exact TF binding locus. To overcome this issue, Rhee and Pugh have developed a refined ChIP-protocol including a DNA trimming step to cleave DNA fragments unprotected by DNA binding proteins (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This method, called ChIP-exo (ChIP exonuclease), has greatly enhanced the mapping resolution of TF binding sites (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Nonetheless, the majority of TFs bind to DNA with other TF partners across a cluster of TFBSs, also termed&#x000a0;<italic>cis</italic>-regulatory module (CRM) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Consequently, in spite of the great improvement made by ChIP-exo, DNA regions bound by transcriptional complexes cannot be split into individual TF binding sites by exonuclease, which still obscures the delimitation of the precise binding site for a TF of interest (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In other words, current <italic>in vivo</italic> protocols may generate TF DNA binding motifs that are generally biased by the presence of co-factors. For example, Starick <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> observed a much lower occurrence of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding motif but a higher fraction of GATA-related binding sites in the peaks derived from K562 GR ChIP-exo, compared to other cell types such as IMR90 and U2OS. They speculated a cell-specific tethering recruitment of GR onto DNA sequences in K562 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In addition, Cohen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> have recently described that variations in CEBPB motif were context-dependent (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In their study, they described higher preservation of canonical CEBPB motif in the cell-type independent context compared to cell-type specific contexts. Hence, a straightforward analysis of DNA binding motif derived from ChIP-based methods may not be sufficient to predict the actual TF binding site. For some TFs, additional systematic analyses are required to precisely delineate the TF recognition site, taking the presence of co-factors into account. Overall, cooperative binding of multiple TFs in the CRM enables high binding specificity and fine-tuning in gene regulation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Hence, it is of great importance to understand TF binding behaviours collectively instead of individually.</p><p>Integrated with DNA methylation profiles, our recently launched cell-specific TF-binding profile database, MethMotif, has clearly showed that cell context influences TFBS at both sequence and epigenetic levels (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). DNA methylation information is therefore an additional layer to take into consideration for a comprehensive TF binding analysis, in order to delineate precise DNA sequence affinity and uncover TF function in a specific cell context. Nevertheless, although numerous cistrome databases and tools facilitating the prediction of CRMs and cofactors of a TF of interest are available (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref>), an environment connecting a large compendium of TF binding sites and respective DNA methylation profiles is still lacking. To fill this gap, we have established a large collection of standard ChIP-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) datasets derived from the GTRD repository (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and MethMotif database (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This information can be browsed, analyzed and compared to other data sources <italic>via</italic> TFregulomeR, an R package that contains processing and visualization functions. To our knowledge, TFregulomeR is the first platform enabling the query and the analysis of context-specific TF modules according to cell type, tissue origin and disease state. This is also the first computational tool allowing a standard integration of TF module binding sites with their respective DNA methylation profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In essence, TFregulomeR facilitates the analysis of context-specific transcription regulation and fosters our understanding of regulatory network-dependent TF functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cistrome and methylome data in TFregulomeR</title><p>TF motif position weight matrices (PWM) recorded in the TFregulomeR compendium are compiled from the MethMotif database (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and GTRD (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). MethMotif includes a comprehensive collection of TF motifs complemented with methylation information. Briefly, relying on the Irreproducibility Discovery Rate (IDR) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), ChIP-seq peaks were standardly called using MACS2 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), followed by a motif <italic>de novo</italic> enrichment analysis with MEME-ChIP (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), focusing on regions defined by a &#x000b1;100&#x000a0;bp window around peak summits. Subsequently, DNA methylation profiles were inferred using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) datasets in all peak regions and predicted TFBSs.</p><p>GTRD is a large collection of publicly available ChIP-seq experiments which serves as an important complementary source to enlarge the PWM pool in TFregulomeR. ChIP-seq peaks identified by MACS peak caller from the untreated experiments were downloaded from GTRD database. Following the same pipeline in the MethMotif, centrally enriched TF motifs were localized using MEME-ChIP with the default settings in a 200&#x000a0;bp range surrounding peak centres. In TFregulomeR compendium, highly and centrally enriched motifs were selected and compared with the existing TF-binding profile databases, such as JASPAR (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and HOCOMOCO (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In some ChIP-seq, the significantly enriched motifs did not correspond to the motifs of ChIP&#x02019;ed TFs. Among 1468 PWM records in TFregulomeR, we identified 91 motifs different from those reported in TF-binding profile databases. Furthermore, 136 motif matrices were not recorded for their corresponding TFs in these databases. In order to verify that these 227 motifs do not derive from the use of a specific motif discovery algorithm, we used another motif discovery tool, HOMER (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), based on different algorithm hypergeometric enrichment, to perform an additional <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery. The motifs obtained with HOMER were compared with those obtained with MEME-ChIP, and their similarities were measured by normalized Pearson correlation coefficient using the <italic>compare-matrices</italic> function in RSAT (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) with the formula: Ncor = cor * w / w_smaller, where cor is raw Pearson correlation coefficient, w is the alignment width of two matrices from MEME-ChIP and HOMER (the minimum value of w was set as 5), and w_smaller is the width of smaller motifs from MEME-ChIP and HOMER.</p><p>Each PWM has its own unique ID, which keeps track of the source, species, cell type and TF (<italic>e.g</italic>. &#x02018;MM1_HSA_K562_CEBPB&#x02019; and &#x02018;GTRD-EXP010975_HSA_Ishikawa_CEBPB&#x02019;). Since TF binding preferences are obviously dependent on the context, all obtained TFBS datasets have been thoroughly annotated in terms of species, organ, sample type, cell or tissue origin, disease state and experiment source.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>TFregulomeR functionalities</title><p>TFregulomeR provides functionalities to ease data access, retrieval, integration and analysis.

This is presumably due to the fact that in the given cell type, the ChIP&#x02019;ed TF is mostly recruited by other TFs instead of directly binding to DNA, and/or that the high presence of some non-targeted motifs repeatedly observed across ChIP-seq datasets, also known as &#x02018;zinger&#x02019; motifs, mask the motif enrichment of the ChIP&#x02019;ed TF (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In TFregulomeR compendium, we identified 91 PWMs different from TF-binding profile databases, such as JASPAR (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and HOCOMOCO (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In order to verify that divergent motifs do not derive from the use of a specific motif discovery algorithm (in our case MEME-ChIP based on an expectation maximization approach), we used another algorithm, HOMER (based on hypergeometric enrichment), to perform an additional <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery. Motif consistency details have been compiled into the TFregulomeR compendium, and divergent PWMs were flagged to allow users to interpret their results with caution.</p><p>TFregulomeR compendium is accessible <italic>via</italic> an effective R-package application program interface (API), called TFregulomeR. This API offers the required functions for easy data access, analysis and integration in pipelines. TFregulomeR facilitates (i) the recognition of context in/dependent TF binding locations (cistrome);&#x000a0;(ii) the identification of context-specific TF-interacting partners (interactome); and (iii) the characterization of functionally active <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRM) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As demonstrated in the next sections, TFBS context-comparative analysis enables the identification of novel TFBS features, in particular the characterization of co-factors and their influence on TF functions. TFregulomeR also includes generic functionalities such as TFBS genomic annotation, which can be used to locate the genomic binding site landscapes of a TF of interest depending on cell type and/or partner combination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> right). Interestingly, algorithms implemented in our toolbox allow the detection and segregation of multiple cofactor-derived motifs present in the PWM directly computed from whole genome context (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, middle, <italic>cf</italic>. detailed hereafter). In contrast to all available tools (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref>), by integrating DNA methylome datasets, TFregulomeR uniquely emphasizes the impact of DNA modifications in TF-module recruitment and reveals how DNA methylation can affect TF functions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). At last, objects generated by the TFregulomeR package are compatible with third-party packages such as TFBSTools, which provides means for TFBS matrix handling and motif scanning (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and rGREAT, for ontology analysis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). These TFregulomeR objects can be also exported for downstream analyses using external servers like RSAT (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In the following case studies, we focus on CEBPB, MAFF and ATF3 binding data to demonstrate the capacity of TFregulomeR to reveal co-factor partnership and perform motif deconvolution.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>Deconvolution of transcription factor motifs: the case of CEBPB</title><p>Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> HT-SELEX approach, CEBPB specific binding sequence has been characterized as a dimeric motif ATTGCGCAAT (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), where CAAT (or its reverse complement ATTG) is the well-known DNA-binding motif of all CEBP family members, and the CG dinucleotide is the spacer between two coupled binding sites (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, among the 16 CEBPB ChIP-seq experiments recorded in the TFregulomeR compendium, only a few shows a motif enrichment fully consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> canonical sequence. Instead, most returned motif logos display a conserved ATTG/CAAT half site along with the other degenerated half motif that looks like a combination of ATTG/CAAT and TCA/TGA, suggesting that the motif is composed by a mixture of homodimer and heterodimer binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Actually, this phenomenon has already been described previously for another CEBP family member. Indeed, Cai <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> have shown that CEBPA binds novel genomic sites when it dimerizes with AP-1 family members, which recognize the motif TCA/TGA (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). More recently, by analyzing high-throughput sequencing datasets, Cohen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> have extended this observation to CEBPB. In their study, they compared the CEBPB binding sites across six cell types and showed a higher occurrence of canonical CEBPB motif in the cell-type shared regions compared to the cell-type specific loci (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). TFregulomeR enabled the systematic validation of this phenomenon in a bigger cohort encompassing 16 cell types and, more importantly, provided a possible explanation for motif variations depending on context.</p><p>After loading all binding sites present in our data compendium, we segregated the K562 CEBPB binding loci according to the number of cell types where they are enriched. This analysis shows that less cell-specific are the K562 CEBPB peaks, less is the number of peaks, but higher is the read enrichment within these loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). In line with the study by Cohen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, analysis with TFregulomeR showed an increased enrichment of the homodimer motif (ATTGCGCAAT) when the K562 CEBPB peaks were less cell-specific, while a more degenerate motif was over-represented across the K562-specific binding loci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). Such observation was not unique to K562 cells but a widespread phenomenon across all other 15 cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Analysis of binding partners and motifs in K562 context-specific CEBPB peaks.

Indeed, one function implemented in TFregulomeR has been designed for the characterization of co-factors within the sub-ensembles of binding sites (<italic>e.g</italic>. K562 CEBPB peaks shared by different number of cell types, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Among all other 130 TFs profiled in K562, CEBPD and ATF4 were characterized as the two main recurrent CEBPB cofactors. Indeed, near than 37% of CEBPB binding sites were co-occupied by CEBPD, a member of CEBP family, and a third of CEBPB binding sites were co-localized with ATF4, a member of activating transcription factor (ATF) family (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Interestingly, the TFregulomeR context-specific analysis clearly shows that CEBPD is overrepresented in CEBPB binding loci shared across all cell types, whereas ATF4 co-binds with CEBPB mainly in K562-specific CEBPB binding sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To further confirm the connection between the TCA motif and the ATF4 co-dimer, we computed the DNA binding site motif of the intersection of ATF4 and CEBPB binding loci within the K562-specific CEBPB peaks. As expected, the resulting motif logo is a clear CEBPB-ATF4 heterodimer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, left). Therefore, this observation suggests that ATF4 is not merely a CEBPB co-factor, but rather dimerizes with CEBPB, thereby corroborating with a previous study by Jolma <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> using an <italic>in vitro</italic> approach called consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CAP-SELEX) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). A similar analysis was performed on the K562 shared CEBPB peaks and the prevalence of the homodimer-type motif (ATTGCGCAAT) could be explained by the fact that, within these loci, CEBPB principally dimerizes with CEBPD, which shares the same recognition DNA binding site (ATTG/CAAT) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, right). In addition, our TFregulomeR analysis also pointed to a link between CEBPB cofactors and the dinucleotide spacer composition. Remarkably, the homodimer-type motifs (CEBP-CEBP) were clearly enriched with CG dinucleotide in the spacers, while CA dinucleotides were more present in heterodimer motifs. Consequently, CEBP-CEBP binding loci are more subjected to DNA methylation compared to heterodimer binding sites. More precisely, TFregulomeR revealed a considerable portion of hypermethylated CGs associated with CEBPB-CEBPD partnership in the cell type-independent regions, whereas the CGs around CEBPB-ATF4 co-binding regions were prone to hypomethylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In addition to connecting DNA methylation profiles to context-specific TF binding sites, the TFregulomeR compendium also includes read enrichment scores to assess the binding strength of a given TF in the context of different partners or DNA methylation profiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>The CEBPB TFBS motif is currently described as a mixture of CEBPB and other cofactors in all main TF-binding profile databases, including JASPAR (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), HOCOMOCO (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)&#x000a0;and MethMotif (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Here, we have illustrated how TFregulomeR can improve the accuracy of PWM through the deconvolution of TFBS motifs and the characterization of TF partners influencing DNA binding sites at the sequence and methylation levels.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>Deconvolution of binding partners: the case of MAFF</title><p>TFregulomeR compendium records MAFF ChIP-seq experiments from three different cell types: K562, HeLa-S3 and HepG2, extracted from the MethMotif database (respective accession number: MM1_HSA_K562_MAFF, MM1_HSA_HeLa-S3_MAFF and MM1_HSA_HepG2_MAFF). Surprisingly, MAFF displays distinct cell-specific DNA binding preferences in terms of DNA sequences and DNA methylation levels. The inconsistence of MAFF binding motifs is also present in other TF-binding profile databases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These binding sequences are composed by a common TCAGCA motif and a TGA trinucleotide, which is highly enriched in K562, moderately present in HeLa-S3, but absent in HepG2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This observation was accentuated when we focused only on MAFF cell-specific peaks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The differences of motif enrichments across these three cell types were also associated with varied DNA methylation states. We observed a more hypomethylated DNA profile within the MAFF peaks in K562, while a considerable portion of CGs in HepG2 MAFF peaks were hypermethylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Analysis of MAFF binding partners and motifs in cell-specific peak regions.

In this DNA methylation heatmap, each row represents a co-factor, while each column shows a methylation score interval. The color intensity implies the percentage of CGs with methylation scores in the given interval.

Throughout MAFF peaks specific to K562 cells, TFregulomeR highlighted several co-factors that were highly co-bound with MAFF, including Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 (NFE2) and Erythroid 2 Like 2 (NFE2L2), which are known to bind an AP1-like binding site (TGA/TCA) and thus explain the presence of this motif in MAFF&#x02019;s K562 peaks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In contrast, NFE2L2 was not detected as MAFF&#x02019;s co-factor across HeLa-S3 and HepG2 cell lines (NFE2 ChIP-seq data are not available for the two cell lines), supporting the fact that the TGA trinucleotide enrichment in K562 MAFF binding loci coincides with the presence of NFE2 and NFE2L2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Altogether, these observations suggest that the TGA sub-motif in K562 context actually correspond to NFE2 and NFE2L2 binding sites. To further validate this hypothesis, we generated the motif logo of MAFF K562-specific binding sites without the binding loci shared with NFE2 and NFE2L2, which encompass 517 regions. As expected, the resulting pattern displays a significant decrease in TGA trinucleotide enrichment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p><p>Although the MAFF-NFE2 binding complex has been already described in the JAPSAR database (accession number: MA0501.1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), here we showed how TFregulomeR is able to systematically discover cell type-specific interactions between MAFF and other TFs influencing DNA binding motifs. Furthermore, TFregulomeR adds an epigenetic layer to the binding site information, thereby enhancing our understanding of the role of TF complexes in gene regulation and chromatin modeling. In this particular example, we observed a correlation between the number of MAFF co-factors and DNA methylation states across different cell types. Indeed, in hypomethylated K562 unique MAFF loci, we found evidence for being co-bound by multiple co-factors, in contrast with HepG2 exclusive MAFF peaks, characterized by a great portion of hypermethylated CG where only MAFK emerged as a co-factor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Our analysis shows that MAFF is able to bind methylated DNA only in the absence of NFE2 and NFE2L2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting distinct regulatory roles of MAFF conferred by the presence of NFE2 and NFE2L2.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Change of TF functions depending on partnership</title><p>As we illustrated previously (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), a TF could play distinct roles in different cell types. Moreover, the high occupancy of heterotypic dimers across cell type-specific CEBPB binding loci encouraged us to speculate that TF cell-specific regulatory roles may be partly attributed to binding partners. Indeed, we observed the distinct ontologies of targeted genes between CEBPB-CEBPD and CEBPB-ATF4 in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). It is known that the collaborative interaction of TF across CRM contributes to the context-specific gene expression (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Here, we focus on the case of ATF3 to demonstrate the capability of TFregulomeR to reveal partner-dependent roles across different cell types. In HCT116 and K562, the bound loci were highly enriched with a typical AP-1 type motif (TGA[G|C]TCA), while a different motif was extracted from GM12878, H1-hESC and HepG2 binding sites (GTCACGTG,&#x000a0;Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The differences at the sequence level are associated with different cofactors. JUN and FOSL1 were the predominant ATF3 co-factors in HCT116 and K562 cells, while USF proteins were found to be the main ATF3 partners in GM12878, H1-hESC and HepG2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Likewise, different partnerships lead to different binding loci. ATF3&#x02013;USF complex was more inclined to occupy gene promoter regions, compared to the ATF3&#x02013;JUN/FOSL1 complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Interestingly, &#x0223c;70% of the regions bound by the ATF3&#x02013;USF complex were conserved with other cell types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), suggesting a shared function. More precisely, 704 ATF3&#x02013;USF bound loci shared across all cell types were targeting genes involved in lysosome organization, intracellular transport and transferrin transport (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In contrast, the majority of binding sites bound by the ATF3&#x02013;JUN/FOSL1 in HCT116 and K562 cells were cell-type specific (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), and revealed a distinct set of biological functions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Analysis of ATF3 binding partners and functions.

Hence, it is logical to study TF genomic regulatory properties in a cell type-specific manner. In recent years, important efforts were devoted to investigate cell-specific TF binding activities (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;45</xref>). ENCODE-DREAM <italic>in vivo</italic> Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge was established to promote the development and assessment of cell type-specific TF binding prediction tools, which were expected to replace time-consuming and expensive biological experiments such as ChIP-seq (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). However, performances of the state-of-the-art approaches proved to be limited, implying the necessity of further experiments to infer high confidence TFBS. Furthermore, a recent study has highlighted cell specificity in TFBS by introducing a modified protein binding microarray protocol, nextPBM (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Interestingly, in this new protocol, the replacement of purified or over-expressed proteins with cell nuclear extracts enabled the consideration of cell-specific TF post-translational modifications and cooperativity. Nonetheless, nextPBM overlooks other important factors influencing TF binding, such as DNA methylation (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Hence, an approach based on an <italic>in vivo</italic> and cell-specific framework is necessary to fully decipher TF genomic preferences. Furthermore, the collaborative interaction among TF is a common phenomenon across CRM at the genome scale, and such heterotypic combinations impact TF recognized DNA sequences. A systematic protein&#x02013;protein interaction (PPI) analysis has provided compelling evidence for the widely spread heterodimerization across the bZIP family, which results in diversity of motif patterns (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Therefore, it is appealing to study TF binding behaviors collectively instead of individually. In this respect, TFregulomeR enables combinatorial analyses of TF genomic binding propensities in an <italic>in vivo</italic> and cell-specific fashion.</p><p>TFregulomeR is linked to a large and up-to-date pool of TF cistrome derived from ChIP-seq experiments, along with the methylome landscape inferred from WGBS. TFregulomeR includes efficient and ready-to-use functionalities to ease the access, integration and analysis of large TFBS datasets. These manually curated datasets and designed functionalities together constitute a comprehensive toolbox to study CRM and TF interactions. We showed that the heterotypic dimerization of CEBPB with other bZIP family members leads to a degenerate (half-site) binding motif, which overall obscures the genome-wide motif pattern. Similarly, MAFF partners impact on the binding motifs recognized in different cell types. Interestingly, while TFregulomeR performs motif deconvolution by analyzing the TFBSs remaining in the context-specific peak regions, the significance of such TFBSs enrichment within the corresponding peak subsets was confirmed by <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery for all our case studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Users can therefore verify the statistical relevance of these novel TFregulomeR-generated motifs by exporting peak subsets and performing <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery. Furthermore, similar to the case studies focusing on CEBPB and MAFF, in which ATF4 and NFE2 motifs were recovered in K562 CEBPB and MAFF peaks respectively, we were also able to identify CEBPB and MAFF motifs in K562 ATF4 and NFE2 peaks respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>Even though efforts have been made to separate closely positioned TFBSs, approaches to effectively deconvolute motifs are still lacking. Although CSDeconv discriminates TFBSs separated as few as 40 bp (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), this spacer resolution apparently fails to distinguish two motifs closely positioned (<italic>e.g</italic>. MAFF and NFE2 motifs are only 1 bp distance in K562) or even to dissect heterodimer binding motifs&#x000a0;(<italic>e.g</italic>. ATF4-CEBPB heterodimer in K562). Other motif discovery approaches, such as Maskminent (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), which enriches adjacent cofactor motifs by masking primary TF binding sites or <italic>vice versa</italic>, and dyad analysis (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), which identifies two motifs separated by a spacer, cannot dissect a degenerate part in a motif from a mixture of homo- and hetero-dimers. This may be due to spacer conservation (for example, we found high-level of CG dinucleotide in CEBP-CEBP spacers), a feature that is ignored in current deconvolution algorithms, which expect spacers as &#x02018;non-relevant&#x02019; sequences. Altogether, <italic>in vivo</italic> cistrome data empowers TFregulomeR as a reliable tool to dissect different TFBSs from a generally characterized PWM matrix. Several strategies could be adopted to achieve motif deconvolution using TFregulomeR. Firstly, it has been shown that main leucine zipper factors usually directly dimerize with their partners. Therefore, motif deconvolution can be done by selecting the subsets of sequence binding sites exclusive to the TFs and their partners (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>), or by removing overlapped peaks by co-factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Secondly, given the fact that TF partners can be cell specific, motif deconvolution thus can be done by selecting the subsets of sequence binding sites from cell specific peaks of a TF of interest (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the methylome datasets encompassed by TFregulomeR revealed distinct DNA methylation patterns in different deconvoluted motifs, suggesting an interesting correlation between binding partners and DNA methylation states for both CEBPB and MAFF (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The inclusion of generic annotation functions completes TFregulomeR toolbox and thereby ease the study of TF functions depending on partner combinations. Indeed, using TFregulomeR, we could characterize the cooperation of ATF3 with different TF partners depending on cell types, as well as the corresponding functions of targeted genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Observed differences between target genes of a TF depending on its partner across cell types could be due to the distinct chromatin accessibility patterns.</p><p>In conclusion, combining a valuable compendium of cistrome and methylome data with effective computational tools, the current TFregulomeR release constitutes a comprehensive resource to characterize TF context-specific binding partners and enriched motifs, uniquely taking into account DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The TFregulomeR package (encoded in R) and a user manual are available in GitHub, together with all the scripts used in the reported analyses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/benoukraflab/TFregulomeR">https://github.com/benoukraflab/TFregulomeR</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1088_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="gkz1088_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Morgane Thomas-Chollier, Thomas J.
