Pulsed corticosterone presentation reveals MR and GR co-occupy DNA only at the peaks of glucocorticoid oscillations, allowing interaction. GR DNA occupancy was pulsatile, while MR DNA occupancy was prolonged through the inter-pulse interval. In mouse mammary 3617 cells MR-GR interacted in the nucleus and at a chromatin-associated DNA binding site. Interactions occurred irrespective of ligand type and receptors formed complexes of higher order than heterodimers. We also detected MR-GR interactions <italic>ex-vivo</italic> in rat hippocampus. An expanded range of MR-GR interactions predicts structural allostery allowing a variety of transcriptional outcomes and is applicable to the multiple tissue types that co-express both receptors in the same cells whether activated by the same or different hormones.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L007622/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lightman</surname><given-names>Stafford L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Neuroendocrinology Charitable Trust</institution></funding-source><award-id>12/13-5751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lightman</surname><given-names>Stafford L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Neuroendocrinology Charitable Trust</institution></funding-source><award-id>13/14-5810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lightman</surname><given-names>Stafford L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Society for Endocrinology</institution></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6773-5317</contrib-id><name><surname>Pooley</surname><given-names>John R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Scientific Interchange Scheme Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lightman</surname><given-names>Stafford L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>British Society for Neuroendocrinology (GB)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Project Support Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6773-5317</contrib-id><name><surname>Pooley</surname><given-names>John R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant BB/L007622/1 awarded to S.L.L., [in part] the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research (USA), the Neuroendocrinology Charitable Trust grants 12/13-5751 and 13/14-5810 (to S.L.L.), a Society for Endocrinology Early Career Grant awarded to J.R.P., a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council International Scientific Interchange Scheme award to S.L.L., and a British Society for Neuroendocrinology Project Support Grant (to J.R.P.).

It is well known that stress-evoked glucocorticoid release yields transcriptional responses [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but the ultradian rhythm additionally generates a pulsatile transactivation or transrepression of gene targets that maintains basal gene- and cell-type specific transcriptional programs [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This pulsatile gene activation does not occur in response to the commonly used synthetic glucocorticoids, which especially during long term use, are associated with metabolic and neuropsychiatric side-effects [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A better understanding of the dynamic aspects glucocorticoid signalling pathways is crucial for the rational design of better therapeutic agents.</p><p>Glucocorticoids act through two related steroid hormone receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The MR has approximately a 10-fold higher affinity for corticosterone than GR and produces different activation patterns in response to ultradian and stress-induced stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These ligand-activated transcription factors share a common domain structure [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with a ligand binding domain (LBD) harbouring the ligand binding pocket and an activation function (AF2) domain. A short hinge region separates the LBD from the DNA binding domain (DBD) that contains two zinc fingers providing somewhat flexible recognition of the DNA sequence <monospace>5&#x02019;-TGTTCT-3&#x02019;</monospace>, and allowing the binding of an inverse palindromic glucocorticoid response element (GRE) separated by three base pairs (<monospace>5&#x02019;-GGAACAnnnTGTTCT-3&#x02019;</monospace>) as a dimer [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. MR/GR undergo nuclear translocation following hormone binding and possess unique amino terminal domains (NTD) incorporating the activation function domain (AF1).</p><p>The LBD and DBD between MR and GR are highly similar at the structural and sequence level, reflecting similar hormone selectivity [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and identical DNA binding site recognition [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. By interpreting of models of the isolated DBD, both are understood to dimerize through the D-loop in the second zinc finger [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], however molecular studies have supported flexibility in steroid receptor interactions. For example, ER and TR/RXR interact in different ways using in some cases, alternative interfaces [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The established dimer model, together with the 94% DBD sequence identity between MR/GR [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], lead to the expectation that MR/GR could interact through heterodimerization [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The MR-GR complex was anticipated to take the same form as the DNA-bound GR homodimer [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], replacing GR on one half of the palindromic sequence with MR, then conferring a gene regulatory role distinct from GR or MR alone, though the exact functional outcome may be dependent on the promoter or cell line [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Synergy at transient reporter constructs [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but also inhibition of GR-mediated responses [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] has been documented, while MR-GR complexes can be more effective transrepressors than either receptor alone [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Such work established MR-GR heterodimerization as a mechanism extending the regulatory potential of glucocorticoids in co-expressing cell types [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Although MR-GR interaction at DNA oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic> has been well demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], few efforts have been made to extend these observations to living cells or tissue [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Herein the context of chromatin provides considerably greater restriction to receptor DNA access, even for two proteins recognising the same DNA motif [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

MR-GR may interact through a variety of surfaces allowing the formation of a range MR-GR complexes beyond simple heterodimers. In conflict with the structural heterodimer previously proposed, receptor mutagenesis did not reveal an extensive role for the D-loop in cells. We report MR-GR interaction independently of the type of bound ligand (agonist, antagonist) and at low corticosterone concentrations associated with the pulse peaks of the ultradian rhythm where both receptors co-load at DNA. The heterodimerization model for MR-GR interaction appears incomplete and our findings considerably expand the potential modes by which MR and GR can cooperate to regulate gene expression in conjunction with other allosteric mediators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>MR and GR interact in cell line and hippocampus lysates</title><p>Murine 3617 cells contain a chromatinised array of head-to-tail copies of the MMTV long-terminal repeat (LTR) providing 800&#x02013;1200 GREs in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227520.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

In principle the average molecular brightness doubles with each doubling of molecular stoichiometry (the number of particles within the complex), but because the &#x003b5; value is an average of the population, mixed populations are not well handled by the approach and a 1:1 mixture of trimers and monomers has the same &#x003b5; value as a population of dimers. The data of others also advises caution in overinterpretation of this data [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], but it holds that higher order complexes are associated with higher &#x003b5; values.</p><p>EGFP-rGR was paired with mCherry with which it does not interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227520.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), or with mCherry-rGR with which it was expected to form a population of differentially labelled green-red heterodimers in addition to green-green and red-red homodimers. Measuring only the green channel (EGFP-rGR), red molecules are invisible, therefore green-red dimers appear to be monomers and the average &#x003b5; value significantly reduces when EGFP-rGR is paired with mCherry-rGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227520.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). The magnitude of this decrease was mathematically consistent with differentially labelled red-green heterodimers forming with equal probabilities of assembly as green-green homodimers (&#x003b5; value projected at 66.67% of the +mCherry reference, observed 63.3%), supporting previous reports that GR is found as a dimer in the nucleoplasm of corticosterone treated 3617 cells [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

The lack of decreased brightness suggests GR-MR interactions do not occur, by enlarge, as 1:1 heterodimers. The molecular brightness of mCherry-rMR was additionally consistent in the presence of EGFP or EGFP-rGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227520.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). As N&#x00026;B reports the population average molecular brightness we could not rule out a small population of MR-GR heterodimers assembling at DNA undetectable in nucleoplasm. We therefore measured &#x003b5; at the MMTV array and compared these values to those obtained from the nucleoplasm in the same cells. Heterodimer formation specifically at MMTV DNA would be expected to report lower &#x003b5; values at the array compared to those in the nucleoplasm but the molecular brightness was higher at the array for both EGFP-rGR and mCherry-MR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227520.g007">Fig 7D</xref>) suggesting the presence of higher oligomeric states.

Elegant demonstration of MR/GR occupying the same strand of <italic>Fkbp5</italic> DNA at the same time in rat hippocampal chromatin was important [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but MR/GR may be located at separate sites on the 400 bp average chromatin fragment size. Examining MR/GR at the MMTV array in 3617 cells we found significant cross-correlation signals consistent with direct evidence for MR-GR interaction at chromatinised DNA in the living cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227520.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Together with ChIP studies demonstrating a DNA bound GR was required to recruit a DNA-binding-defective MR [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], the functional role of MR-GR interactions as a transcriptional regulator is now clear. Obtaining <italic>in vivo</italic> direct evidence for interaction using PLA is a logical next step in parallel to exploring which genes are regulated by such complexes. As a potential caveat to our ccN&#x00026;B approach to measuring receptor interactions at DNA, we note that it is only possible to rule out MR/GR separately loading at nearby GREs within the array contributing to the Bcc data obtained provided that movement of any DNA locus containing both simultaneously bound receptors is considerably slower than receptor movements. We assume that such DNA movements are not detected (appear static because far slower than scanner head) on the basis that pixel dwell time and pixel size were optimised around receptor diffusion coefficients 1&#x02013;2 orders of magnitude faster than those reported for individual chromatin loci [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear hormone receptors can form mixed ligand dimers in solution [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and the type of ligand modulates heterodimeric interactions for other nuclear receptors.

As MR and GR can bind to the same or different hormones (e.g. MR+aldosterone, GR+cortisol), ligand context required assessment. Structural predictions with the LBDs suggested MR and GR could interact while binding a variety of alternative ligands. Prednisolone and cortisol had 60 or 70% respectively the Bcc value of corticosterone, which may indicate a weaker level of interaction, reduced complex stoichiometry, or both. Dexamethasone and aldosterone however gave Bcc values similar to corticosterone strongly supporting interaction. When MR/GR were treated with a pair of selective agonists at doses encouraging receptor preference, or with low doses of MR agonists paired with excess GR antagonist, Bcc values continued to support interactions between MR-GR. Mixed ligand complexes may explain how trout MR suppresses GR2-mediated reporter transactivation when bound to cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, or MR antagonist eplerenone [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The expression of 11&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 in many peripheral tissues has led to the expectation that MR-GR interactions could not occur in such locations as endogenous glucocorticoids are prevented from binding MR.

It is probable that the longevity of MR DNA occupancy relates, at least in part, to its 10-fold higher affinity for corticosterone than GR.

Such a view is consistent with recent work [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] using ChIP assay which demonstrates MR increased DNA loading after stressor exposure despite what should already be a very high baseline occupancy of the MR by corticosterone.

At lower doses of corticosterone (5&#x02013;10 nM) we noted that only around 25&#x02013;36% of cells producing arrays (calculated as (purple bar/red bar)*100) loaded both receptors at the same array, compared to 50% at 30 nM and 90% at 100 nM. As the GR<sub>C656G</sub> historically integrated into 3617 derived cells has a comparable corticosterone sensitivity to the wild type receptor, these data are consistent with MR-GR interactions increasing with corticosterone availability [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and perhaps on the nuclear availability of the lower affinity GR which does not fully translocate at 1-10nM within the 20 minute pulse time.

High conservation in this region between steroid hormone receptors implied heterodimerization [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and these results were extrapolated to MR-GR, projecting that DBD of the GR would bind to one half of the inverted repeat while the DBD for MR would bind to the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227520.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). We directly tested the importance of this interface for full length MR-GR interaction in 3617 nuclei using PLA with a mutagenesis approach in which the most disruptive structural prediction (GR A477K, MR A639K) was combined with disruption of the salt bridge consistently targeted for MR-GR [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Using N-terminal truncated receptors, the D-loop was important for full expression of MR-mediated inhibition, though mutation far from eliminated the effect [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similar outcomes have been observed for GR homodimers where the D-loop contributes at best slightly to the interaction in the living cell nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We now reveal parallel findings indicating that the D-loop does not govern interaction between many MR and GR molecules, suggesting both limits of the D-loop mediated heterodimer model, but also that there must be alternatives. As both the number of cells showing PLA activity and the number of dots per cell are each as dependent on transfection efficiency in this approach as on the amount of interaction the number of dots visible per cell is subject to additional variables.</p><p>We predict alternative interfaces that could mediate MR-GR interaction in these contexts, finding multiple possible arrangements for both DBDs and LBDs. We do not rule out further interfaces within the intrinsically disordered NTD and hinge of these molecules. These predictions appear to explain the range of experimental data with MR-GR interactions mediated through the DBDs [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], the MR NTD [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and the GR LBD [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Such conflicting information could relate to the use of receptors from different species but may reflect a potential for context-dependent utilization of interfaces. Previously, such findings have been interpreted as a multi-faceted dimerization interface centred on the D-loop with support from other regions. Instead we propose multiple possible MR-GR arrangements of which at least a majority in 3617 cells are not assembled through the D-loop. Like others [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and consistent with conflicting reports of the interface location, we argue that MR and GR may interact in multiple modes parallel to other nuclear receptors. It is not yet clear whether multiple MR-GR complexes can exist within the same cell type, or whether different complexes confer differential DNA binding activity, cofactor recruitment, and transcriptional outcomes but we view both possibilities as likely within the emerging principals of allostery. Mutational experiments with so many possible interacting modes might prove challenging but would be best guided by in-silico mutation to examine which amino acids among the hot spots / interface amino acids provided are the best candidates.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Allostery in steroid hormone receptors</title><p>DNA allosterically influences GR whereby the exact GRE sequence including the spacer allows GR to bind in slightly different conformations repositioning key DBD interfaces [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

However, the majority of nuclear receptors are not DNA-bound [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] so the relationship between the molecular brightness in the nucleoplasm and at the MMTV array was examined. Anticipating heterodimer formation between chromatin-associated, interacting MR-GR would be associated with a lower &#x003b5; at the array relative to the nucleoplasm (where brightness increased or stayed the same), we instead observed higher oligomerisation states for both MR and GR at the array. Interestingly, GR tetramerization at the array was recently reported [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Our current data imply that far from heterodimer formation, MR/GR may also assume a higher order complex at DNA, possibly supported through the variety of interfaces predicted.

Structurally supporting a variety of alternative complexes we propose structural malleability or allostery as a feature of MR-GR cooperative function contributing to functional diversity in glucocorticoid-mediated gene regulation. The interacting MR-GR arrangement may depend on the availability of a broad spectrum of ligands, the DNA binding site, and non-receptor interacting partners. Drug discovery has targeted higher affinity, longer acting, GR-selective compounds for anti-inflammatory activity and steroid replacement therapy. If MR and GR interact in co-expressing cell types to mediate at least some actions of endogenous glucocorticoid hormones present approaches are likely to be compromised by a significant risk of side effects.

The PRISM algorithm is a template-based protein interaction prediction tool that utilises interaction structures available in the Protein Data Bank [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] as templates to predict structural interaction between two query proteins. PRISM generates multiple possible models using template interfaces that show a good match to any possible interaction interface between the two query proteins. Rigid docking results are then flexibly refined to resolve steric clashes, outputting a pdb file of the predicted interaction structure and a list of interacting amino acids in the predicted interface. Publications of the PRISM tool have been cited by 287 papers, including recent independent publications from 2017 and 2019 that have validated PRISM predictions via experimental methods [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227520.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].</p><p>Binding energies of PRISM predictions were calculated using ZRANK [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], an optimised energy function providing an arbitrary energy score for comparative analyses allowing ranking of multiple protein docking predictions. Energies were computed for all PRISM interaction predictions utilising interfaces from the nuclear receptor protein family. For each possible interface per query pair of proteins, the prediction with the lowest energy score for that interface was used. For cross-checking and selection of the most probable models, the PDBePISA server of the European Bioinformatics Institute was used [<xref rid="pone.0227520.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].

According to PDBePISA, P&#x0003e;0.5 means interface is less hydrophobic than it could be, and likely to be an artefact of crystal packing. P&#x0003c;0.5 indicates significant hydrophobicity, implying that the interface surface can be interaction-specific.
