This enables compressibility to support weight and to distribute loads of the joints [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The absence of blood and lymphatic vessels restricts the direct access to nutrients and limits healing capability [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In an avascular tissue where nutrients and cytokines are mainly distributed by diffusion, joint motion assists to the transport rate of solutes [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mechanical activity in joints supports the proper functionality of chondrocytes, improves ECM content, promotes glycosaminoglycan synthesis, and fiber organization [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227553.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, mechanical stimulation contributes to the synthesis of ECM components by chondrocytes even if isolated from patients with osteoarthritis [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, mechanical loading plays a pivotal role for the nutrients delivery, waste disposal, repair and AC healthiness [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Bioreactors are biotechnological devices used in cartilage engineering to evaluate diverse mechanical stimulation strategies as compression, tension, hydrostatic pressure and shear stress, acting on natural cartilage tissue or cartilage-like constructs [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Of these mechanical stimuli, direct compression has been widely examined, since it simulates the stress exerted on AC by the opposite joint component [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Compressive forces have been applied either under static or dynamic conditions, but dynamic stimulation mimics the physiological environment of the AC better. Furthermore, it has been shown to induce proteoglycan and collagen-II synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The standard clinical procedures for treating AC defects are autologous chondrocytes implantation (ACI), mosaicplasty, and microfracture. The current ACI therapy known as matrix-induced ACI (MACI), consists on isolating the chondrocytes in a first surgery, <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion for several weeks, cell implantation in a matrix, and its implantation in a second surgical procedure [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Mosaicplasty implies the use of osteochondral autologous plugs taken from non-weight bearing regions to transplant them in the defect area. Lastly, microfracture focuses on stimulating the bone marrow through micro-perforations in the subchondral bone, which promotes a blood clot formation in the defect site, containing progenitor cells and growth factors that induces defect healing. Despite their wide application, the clinical outcomes are not fully fulfilled yet, mainly because the repaired tissue is fibrotic with inferior quality biochemical and mechanically in comparison to hyaline cartilage [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To maintain tissue homeostasis in the body, stem and progenitors cells can be mobilized from their niches to the injury site for repairing [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are target components for cell-based therapies, e.g., for bone and cartilage injuries, because of their multi-lineage differentiation potential and properties that promote regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Alternative to their application as <italic>ex vivo</italic> expanded cell products, induction of endogenous mobilization may provide a better outcome than current therapies. MSCs with chondrogenic differentiation potential reside in bone marrow, stroma, synovium, infrapatellar fat pad and periosteum [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227553.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], of which the bone marrow has been the most common reservoir to obtain MSCs in cartilage defects research [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although, AC on the joint is spatially separated from the bone marrow by the subchondral bone lamella.</p><p>We hypothesize that mechanical stimuli are involved in endogenous cartilage repair induced by the mobilization of stem cells besides other factors when the subchondral bone is opened.

LN521 is a basement membrane protein present in stem cells niches, involved in cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

This side of the gel probably stretched toward the cell reservoir during loading.

One of the limitations of our experimental setup is that we cannot be sure about the complete integration of LN521 into the alginate structure at molecular level, but we speculate that some of the LN521 molecules were trapped in the internal network of the scaffold. The use of oxidizing agents as IO4<sup>-</sup> when preparing the scaffolds can be addressed for future approaches, allowing interaction between aldehyde groups of the oxidized alginate and amine residues of the laminin, as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>When the subchondral bone is perforated in a microfracture surgery, blood clots are formed and a suitable environment for tissue healing is created, promoting migration of MSCs and releasing growth factors and cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227553.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

From the mechanical point of view, the load pattern applied in this study showed a single higher peak of the force amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227553.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) induced after the lift maneuver due to the piston moved downwards with a higher velocity after the released period.

The apparent increase of cell viability observed once the load was applied intermittently, suggests that nutrients and gas exchange may have occurred during the lifts of the piston. Therefore, the culture medium passed through the scaffold and reached the cells located at the cell reservoir, and the elastic ring prevented bypasses by a sealing effect under pressure. The applied intermittent dynamic mechanical stimulation seemed not to harm the cells when using functionalized scaffolds; in contrast, we observed a higher number of viable cells even after finding one value of the replicates close to the non-stimulated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227553.g005">Fig 5</xref>). We would like to highlight that the cell reservoir had a limited size and thus, medium supply could affect viability within 24 hours. The viability of the cells in the control was 55% whereas corresponding viabilities in cell culture flasks were only slightly higher with 70% (data not shown). Hence, we speculate that the conditions in the cell reservoir were not optimal for 1x10<sup>5</sup> cells as a volume of 80 &#x003bc;L of medium and alginate solution was limited, and the lack of nutrients and waste disposal may have harmed some cells for the observation time. However, the culture medium placed on top, and that reached the cell reservoir under intermittent loading, could have contributed to better cultivation conditions, resulting in 68% cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227553.g005">Fig 5</xref>), which was close to the viability in cell culture flasks (data not shown).</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting mobilization of MSCs from a low compartment to another at the top against gravity, induced by biomechanical stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Migration of chondrocytes under mechanical stimulation has been previously stated [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and migration of MSCs under mechanical stimulation was addressed in the past by Ode and collaborators, demonstrating that loading hampered the mobilization of MSCs in bone healing context [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] using a bioreactor system previously described [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Both bioreactors were able to apply load on a scaffold. The main difference between them is that Ode at al., used a pneumatic force application system [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], whereas our force transmission was performed mechanically from a step motor over the stiff piston to the surfaces of the scaffold and silicone ring. The loading protocols also differ since Ode and collaborators applied 20% strain at 1 Hz for 72 hours, while our parameters were 10% strain at 0.3 Hz frequency as previously reported in [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], intermittently for 24 hours. The comparison of both approaches supports our assumption that mobilization of MSCs was not induced when applying mechanical loading alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227553.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Our findings indicate that the cells were found in the hydrogel only when mechanical loading was applied intermittently and adjoined by the used of LN521-functionalized scaffolds.</p><p>Furthermore, higher levels of cell viability were found in the experiments performed using functionalized scaffolds, which indicates that LN521 may contribute to the wellness of cells during the test. We speculate that this explains why lower cell viability was found under loading in non-functionalized alginate scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227553.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p><p>The experimental approach that we presented in our bioreactor has unique hardware and software architecture, composed of separated devices for cell cultivation, mechanical application, and software (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227553.g001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227553.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227553.g003">3</xref>). In addition, our focus was to analyze cartilage repair using functionalized-hydrogel scaffolds, where the cells were quantified by a custom made 3D-imaged based protocol [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>This proof-of-concept study has some limitations. We presented 6 examinations, but it has to be taken into consideration that the cells were harvested from one animal. To be able to focus on the understanding of the mechanical behavior of the innovative device presented here, we controlled the amount of biological variation by not including MSCs from different donors. Thus, we refrained from further analytical statistical evaluation, and the biological variability will be addressed in a future study. Nevertheless, the effect on the number of cells found in the scaffolds was 4-5-fold higher after we applied intermittent mechanical stimulation, functionalized the alginate scaffold with the structural protein LN521, and dispersed the MSCs in the lower reservoir preventing cell sedimentation.</p><p>We detected the cells in the scaffold near to the surface of the scaffold that was close to the reservoir. At this time, we can only speculate how the cells shifted upward from the reservoir to the scaffold. At the current stage, we assume that this more likely happened because of external mechanical reasons rather than any biological active process from the cells as migration, as the shapes of the cells were quite spherical and specific tests for cell migration were not addressed in this study.</p><p>To explain the mechanisms of how the cells are transferred into the scaffolds is still challenging and opens new perspectives to be explored in detail in forthcoming research. To explore whether loading induces fluid movement from the lower compartment toward the scaffold, dark ink was placed at the cell reservoir in an early stage feasibility examination of the bioreactor. The ink diffused in the unloaded scaffolds showing a visible gradient, while fully stained the loaded scaffolds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227553.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This result suggests that mechanical loading induces fluid to move through the scaffold. It is a matter of future studies to explain whether the cells were sucked-up or activated by other mechanisms to displace themselves. LN521 functionalization was important either to attract cells or to allow adherence of dispersed cells within the scaffold or both.</p><p>Future studies are necessary to find out whether the phenomenon suggested with these preliminary results will also be observed with cells from more than one donor, to assess human adult MSCs, to test different incubation times and to evaluate mechanical parameters that can increase the number of functional cells in the scaffolds.</p><p>With this bioreactor being a prototype to test our hypothesis of load inducing the mobilization of MSCs, the design is subject to improvements, e.g., self-replenishment of culture medium, scaffold composition, addition of supplementary factors in the culture medium for growth or differentiation.</p><p>Bone marrow is currently the most common MSCs source for cartilage regeneration research either alone or with biological scaffolds as so called matrix-augmented bone marrow stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our experimental approach might be comparable to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation when the subchondral lamella has been opened i.e., after microfracturing. As previously mentioned, current strategies for AC repair fail to produce hyaline cartilage. The presented bioreactor regime could provide new insights suggesting that endogenous progenitor cell mobilization to the defect site could be targeted by intermittent mechanical loading and functionalized-scaffolds. Moreover, mechanical loading is important in AC for distribution of nutrients, reinforce ECM content, fiber organization, and waste disposal [<xref rid="pone.0227553.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227553.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227553.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The presented bioreactor system and preliminary examinations provide a first insight of loading probably involved in MSCs recruitment. An approach that achieves MSCs endogenous recruitment of MSCs, a proper combination of factors for chondrogenic differentiation, and phenotype maintenance would be beneficial for a fully functional regenerated AC.</p><p>Thus, the relevance of these findings for the orthopedic experimental research field is to establish a biomechanical system <italic>in vitro</italic> that gives us the chance to evaluate mechanical stimulation for cells moving from a compartment beneath, simulating MSCs moving from bone marrow <italic>in vivo</italic>. It may help afterwards to study molecular cues of mobilized <italic>versus</italic> non-mobilized cells and identify additional mechanical and chemical factors for inducing cells to be recruited by a given condition. Further steps will assess whether mechanical loading can induce MCSs for bone or cartilage differentiation. Nonetheless, the first results of the presented study suggest that mechanical stimulation may have an important impact on the mobilization of stem/stromal cells. Thus, a combination of the current strategies applied for AC-regeneration as microfracture, biomechanical protocols and functionalized scaffolds might enhance the outcomes of the current treatments applied in osteoarthritis or AC-trauma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present a bioreactor system for mechanical load application on an <italic>in vitro</italic> biological arrangement as scaffolds.
