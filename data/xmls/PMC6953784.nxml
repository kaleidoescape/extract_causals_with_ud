The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 10 million people developed active TB disease in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Treatment is usually given through the Direct Observation Therapy, Short-Course program (DOTS), and cure rates have been reported at 80% in 2012 and 82% in 2018 [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DOTS program refers to an approach to the delivery of antibiotic treatment in which health personnel observe patients taking their medication daily or three times per week, this approach has been found more effective when compared to self-administered therapy [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, certain factors like poverty, poor access to health services, and mental illness, including depression and substance abuse, have a negative effect on treatment adherence. Decreased compliance often leads to treatment default, which not only increases the probability of medical complications such as developing multidrug-resistant TB or death but also results in greater expenditure for the public healthcare system [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Mental illness is also an important global health concern, with depression affecting nearly 322 million people worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The lifetime risk of suffering from depression among the general population is 5.1% in women and 3.6% in men [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among patients with comorbidities, the prevalence of depression is even greater; for example, 26.8% of patients with hypertension and 8&#x02013;18% of patients with diabetes mellitus also struggle with depression [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Both tuberculosis and depression share common risk factors, which explains the high prevalence of their comorbidity, reported to range from 10&#x02013;52% [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Their interaction is complex since one disease might contribute to the development of the other. On one hand, the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines characteristic of depression leads to decreased activation of the cellular and humoral immune systems, which contributes to the development of TB [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the other hand, TB infection causes chronic inflammation, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate brain enzymes, such as indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, that degrade tryptophan and thereby limit serotonin production. Anti-tuberculosis medications may also play a role in psychiatric disease: isoniazid alters serotonin uptake and high doses of ethambutol have been associated with depression [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Most studies on the comorbidity of TB and depression reveal a significant correlation between depression and poor adherence to TB treatment, as well as higher rates of treatment failure, development of antimicrobial resistance, and higher mortality rates [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Three studies measured depression at baseline and at the end of the intensive phase of TB treatment, two studies measured it at the end of treatment, one measured it at monthly intervals, and one did not provide information regarding the measurement timing of depressive symptoms. Outcomes were defined as per local guidelines, which reflected the definition of WHO recommendations for TB treatment outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, loss to follow-up was defined as not taking medication for at least 30 days without a recommendation from the treating physician. Analysis of TB treatment outcomes revealed a higher risk of negative outcomes, lower success rate, and worse adherence to treatment among patients who presented DS. One study reported an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.46 for treatment default or death in patients with symptoms suggestive of a major depressive episode (MDE) at baseline visit [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], while another also found an increased risk for loss to follow-up and death (RR = 9.09 and 2.99, respectively) in persons with an MDE score suggestive of depression at baseline [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Across the eight studies included in the analysis, the combination of depressive symptoms (DS) and psychological distress (PD) also significantly increases the odds of negative TB treatment outcomes (OR = 4.05). Neither DS nor PD appear to be associated with non-adherence during TB treatment (OR = 1.34).</p><p>In order to properly interpret these results, several factors concerning the measurements of exposure, outcomes, possible confounders must be addressed. First, in relation to the exposure, the main analysis included studies that used both direct (DS) and indirect (PD) measurements of depression as predictors. Although depressive symptoms and psychological distress are correlated, the scales used to measure DS (one short and full version of CES-D, and PHQ-9) focused solely on depression, while the scale used to quantify PD (the K-10 scale) measured not only depressive but also anxiety-related symptoms. A high PD score thus might have actually represented mild depression with severe anxiety. This variation could explain why DS was more strongly associated with negative TB treatment outcomes than PD alone or the combination of DS and PD [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, within each measurement of exposure, different psychometric instruments and cut-off scores were employed. In the case of studies that measured DS, there was notable variability between the scales used: a brief 5-item and the full 20-item version of the CES-D scale, and the PHQ-9 scale [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Others reported results using the exposure as a numeric variable alone [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some studies used a validated cut-off score for DS compatible with MDE based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the CES-D version used by <italic>Yan et al</italic>. was validated with the ICD-10 criteria for mild, moderate and severe depressive disorder. Even if the validation of the instruments were applied on different populations and using a different gold standard (DSM vs. ICD-10 criteria), they were consistently validated to detect more severe forms of depression, which might explain the relative low heterogeneity found on the results. Alternatively, all of the studies on PD utilized the same K-10 scale, but each established different cut-off scores. Two studies used higher cut-off scores (&#x0003e;30 and &#x0003e;28) [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] when compared to <italic>Tola et al</italic>. (&#x0003e;15)[<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, when pooled together with the studies measuring DS, this lower cut-off score might have diluted the effect of the primary meta-analysis by including milder forms of DS.</p><p>Second, in terms of outcomes, the quantification of death and loss to follow-up was uniform across most of the studies reviewed, but there was heterogeneity in the definition and measurement of adherence. For death and loss to follow-up, the majority of the studies synthesized were based on DOTS clinics and used definitions similar to those found in the WHO guidelines for TB treatment [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Definitions of adherence were much less standard across the studies, likely due to the fact that the current WHO guidelines do not specifically define non-adherence. For instance, one study used the MMAS-8 with scores of eight or higher and lower than six suggesting high and low adherence, respectively; other studies measured adherence by asking the participants to estimate their percentage of treatment compliance in the previous three or four week interval, with less than 90% classifying as non-adherence [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While these two found no association between PD and treatment adherence, another study found a strong association between DS and adherence [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The lack of consistency in both the definitions of exposure and outcome may contribute to these seemingly contradictory results. Some studies may have failed to find a significant association [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], however, this may be because their criteria included individuals with lower non-adherence rates when compared to <italic>Yan et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Third, regarding the evaluation of confounding factors, adjusted ORs were used when available for the analysis. If data on adjusted results for the analysis of negative TB treatment outcomes was not available, individual adjusted ORs for death and loss to follow-up were used instead. Most studies accounted for socio-demographic variables such as age, sex, and marital status as well as key variables related to both negative outcomes and depression, such as alcohol intake. Overall, the average age of participants in included studies ranged from 28 to 47.7 years old. On multivariate analyses, one study found older age to increase the risk of death during TB treatment [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although there was no association between DS and age, <italic>Peltzer et al</italic>. found a higher prevalence of PD among the older population [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This suggests that older age might be a potential confounder on the association between DS or PD and death during TB treatment. No association was found between age and loss to follow up. However, ORs adjusted for other possible confounders such as baseline severity of depression, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status were not provided, leaving prominent unaccounted factors for negative TB treatment outcomes.</p><p>Other possible limitations of this meta-analysis include its use of cross-sectional studies and an inability to pool all adjusted ORs. A cross-sectional design is not optimal for establishing causality or providing an appropriate timeframe to study the association between exposure and outcome. These caveats aside, our findings are consistent with the literature on the role of depression on poor treatment outcomes of multiple disorders [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, one study found evidence suggesting that DS were related to poor adherence to HIV treatment, while another uncovered a relationship between DS and missed appointments for diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the causal relationship between DS and non-adherence, loss to follow-up, and death during TB treatment is likely to be complex. Depressive disorders might impair key neurocognitive functions necessary for proper adherence, such as the appreciation and reasoning components of decision making, memory, and executive function, especially when melancholic symptoms are present. This impairment, in turn, could affect awareness and the disposition to receive TB treatment. Given the evidence that such neurocognitive functions seem to improve with the remission of DS, the need to detect DS during TB treatment is all the more important [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The reviewed literature suggests that DS could be a key line of research in the efforts to improve the outcomes of TB treatment. However, in order to properly design and implement an intervention, more preliminary data must identify the most suitable course of action. For example, in order to establish the appropriate period for a timely intervention, we must first better understand how DS evolve during TB treatment and how their variation impacts treatment outcomes. This work calls for the use of universal scales with preset cut-off points to measure depression and facilitate further meta-analysis.</p><p>In addition, measuring the effect of potential mediating factors between DS and negative outcomes of TB treatment might allow us to better identify the most vulnerable populations. For example, depression and substance use disorders, which are themselves associated with both the development of TB and negative outcomes during treatment, also have a high prevalence of comorbidity [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The pathologic use of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine derivatives have been found to increase the severity of co-occurring depressive symptoms and are likely to severely disrupt cognition, further contributing to poor treatment adherence [<xref rid="pone.0227472.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Given the multifactorial consequences of mental illness, there is no doubt that a holistic approach to patient care must be considered in order to adequately treat tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current evidence suggests that depressive symptoms are associated with negative outcomes during the treatment of tuberculosis. We recommend that future research focus on the longitudinal association between depression and TB outcomes, taking into account possible mediators and biological markers that might help to identify subgroups of patients that could benefit from specific interventions, including the treatment of depressive symptoms. Patient management during TB treatment should include depression screening to ensure the quality of care. We also urge that an effort be made to report results for both categorical and continuous depressive measures in order to facilitate more comprehensive meta-analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227472.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>PRISMA 2009 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227472.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227472.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Search strategy for other databases.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227472.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Nicola Young for her help in reviewing this manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227472.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Duko</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gebeyehu</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ayano</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>Prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among patients with tuberculosis at WolaitaSodo University Hospital and Sodo Health Center, WolaitaSodo, South Ethiopia, Cross sectional study</article-title>. <source>BMC Psychiatry</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>15</volume>: <fpage>214</fpage>

Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: Ruiz-Grosso etal. have submitted a review and meta-analysis exploring the association of TB treatment via the DOTS program and depression resulting in negative outcomes such as non-adherence and death.</p><p>While the subject matter of the article is interesting, it occurs that the authors have been extremely careless with their citations. These must be fixed and extensively updated if this can be a published article.</p><p>On numerous occasions the cited paper appears to be incorrect and the way the papers are called out in text "Theron etal., Yan etal. Tola etal.) are papers that do not even appear in the list of references! How can the handful of papers cited for the analysis not appear in the references? The years for studies reported on appear to change between figures for example in Figure 2 Ambaw is 2016, and in Figure 3 its 2018. Even worse is that the only "Ambaw" paper in the references is a 2015 BMJ open study protocol, not even the actual findings of those authors.</p><p>Other major comments:</p><p>- The authors should expand on DOTS - what is the therapy? What drugs does it comprise? What is the length? How many times and how frequently does the patient need to see a healthcare worker? This would help identify to the reader what non-adherence means.</p><p>- Have there been any studies to show how much non-adherence is acceptable? If DOTS is a 9 month program then if drugs are taken for only 8 months, is that sufficient or still completely non-adherent?</p><p>- Page 2, line 36: State that MDR-TB is multi-drug resistant when the term is first introduced.</p><p>- Reference 7 appears to be incorrect. Double check the 121 million figure.</p><p>- Reference 8 is limited to a study in Singapore and may not apply as broadly as used in this context. The authors must find better references to support their claims.</p><p>- Reference 12 appears to be a circular reference not citing an actual research article that can be used to support the author's claims.</p><p>- Page 9 Line 198: state that 'depressive symptoms' are (DS) and psychological distress are (PD) here.</p><p>- Can the authors comment on the age of the study participants included in the studies that they used for the meta-analyses. Especially, when death is a primary outcome, it would be important to state such information.</p><p>In sum, the authors should fix the citations and the text in the figures extensively and address the additional comments outlined above.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Though the total collected dhruv's were more but those selected for the review and analysis were a small number. Understandably as the rest would not have met the required criteria.</p><p>Vital point is to address the heterogeneity in the studies including the definition of depression and treatment outcomes.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Dear Prof. Hasnain Seyed Ehtesham</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS One</p><p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript entitled &#x0201c;Association between Tuberculosis and Depression on Negative Outcomes of Tuberculosis Treatment: A Systematic Review&#x0201d; by Ruiz-Grosso et al. for publication as a research article in PLOS ONE. We have received your comments and have corrected the manuscript accordingly. Please find the response to the comments made bellow:</p><p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE&#x02019;s style requirements, including those for file naming.</p><p>Changes have been made to the manuscript&#x02019;s style to fulfill PLOS ONE&#x02019;s requirements, including headings, figure and table citations, and file naming.</p><p>2. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of the manuscript and update any in-text citations to match accordingly.</p><p>Appropriate captions and in-text citations have been made for Supporting Information. A separate file has been created for S1 Table and has been submitted.</p><p>3. Funding information should not appear in the Acknowledgments section. Please remove any funding-related text from the manuscript and let us know how you would like to update your Funding Statement section of the online submission form.</p><p>Funding-related text has been removed from the manuscript. Please update the Funding Statement section of the online submission form to read: &#x0201c;PRG had support from FONDECYT/CIENCIACTIVA scholarship EF033-235-2015 and from training grant D43TW007393 awarded by the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health. The authors had full access to the study&#x02019;s data and were responsible for the decision to submit for publication.&#x0201d;</p><p>4. Authors have been extremely careless with their citations. These must be fixed and extensively updated.</p><p>References have been added when addressing the papers included in the systematic review. Furthermore, citations have been revised to make sure they are in the correct order and contain the information that we claim in the discussion.</p><p>5. Authors should expand on DOTS. This would help identify to the reader what non-adherence means.</p><p>Two short sentences have been added in introduction which briefly describe DOTS program to help readers understand the usual outpatient setting and program employed to ensure adherence as a public health measure. </p><p>6. Studies to show how much non-adherence is acceptable.</p><p>We have expanded the discussion on the definition and possible significance of non-adherence during TB treatment. We wish to transmit the message that there is no standardized definition for non-adherence and there is uncertainty regarding the number of missed doses needed to alter the treatment outcome. Thus, there is no level of acceptable non-adherence, however, some of the included studies do find an important association between non-adherence as defined per study. This is discussed in page 9, line 160-166, where we describe the ways non-adherence was defined in each study. Furthermore, in page 14, line 240-246, we consider this as an important limitation for the study.</p><p>7. In Page 2 Line 36: State that MDR-TB is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis when the term is first introduced.</p><p>MDR-TB is first introduced as multidrug-resistant TB.</p><p>8. Reference 7 appears to be incorrect. Double check the figure.</p><p>Reference has been updated to WHO Global Health Estimates for total number of people living with depression.</p><p>9. Authors must find a better reference than reference 8 to support their claims.</p><p>Reference has been updated to WHO Global Health Estimates for prevalence of depression among males and females.</p><p>10. Reference 12 appears to be a circular reference.</p><p>Reference has been updated to cite the actual research article that supports our claims.</p><p>11. In Page 9 Line 198: State that &#x0201c;depressive symptoms&#x0201d; is DS and &#x0201c;psychological distress&#x0201d; is PD.</p><p>&#x0201c;Depressive symptoms&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;psychological distress&#x0201d; are referenced as DS and PD in page 13, line 210-211, respectively. </p><p>12. Comment on the age of the study participants that they used for the meta-analyses; especially for death as an outcome.</p><p>Information on age has been added to Table 2 and 3 which report characteristics and summary of findings of the included articles. This has also been addressed in page 14, line 251-262, where we specifically mention age in relation to the analysis that evaluates the association with death as an outcome.</p><p>13. Address the heterogeneity in the studies including the definition of depression and treatment outcomes.</p><p>We have reviewed the discussion regarding the heterogeneity on the definition of both the exposure (depression and psychological distress) and outcome (death, loss to follow up and non-adherence) which can be found on page 13-14, line 223-249. Depression was measured using three different scales (CES-D in full and short versions, PHQ-9), however, the scales were validated to detect severe forms of depression which might explain the low heterogeneity on the main meta-analysis results. PD was measured using the K-10 scale, albeit with different cut-off scores. Death and loss to follow up had clear definitions throughout the studies, while the variability of definitions for non-adherence has been addressed above in point 6.</p><p>We hope you find our responses to your comments to be appropriate.
