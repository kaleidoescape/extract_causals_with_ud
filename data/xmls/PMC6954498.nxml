Invested in Diabetes is a cluster randomized pragmatic trial involving approximately 1440 adult patients with type 2 diabetes. Twenty primary care practices will be randomly assigned to either standardized or patient-driven SMAs. A mixed-methods evaluation will include quantitative (practice- and patient-level data) and qualitative (practice and patient interviews, observation) components.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes among adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Diabetes can be controlled with appropriate diet and physical activity as well as oral and injectable medications, yet as many as 49% of adults with diabetes do not meet targets for glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Poorly controlled diabetes is associated with poor health outcomes, including neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular disease, and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite recent decreases in rates of certain complications, diabetes remains a considerable source of disability and cost to the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The burden of diabetes is great<bold>,</bold> both in terms of patient out-of-pocket healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and poor quality of life, especially among those with complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Patients with T2DM must engage in daily self-management activities including blood glucose monitoring, following dietary recommendations, getting regular physical activity, and adhering to prescribed medications (including insulin management in those who are insulin-dependent). Diabetes self-management is challenging, especially among low-income populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and many patients experience diabetes distress, the sense of being overwhelmed with managing diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Diabetes distress stems from the regimen, interpersonal, emotional, and healthcare navigation burden associated with managing diabetes, and interferes with self-care and glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">According to the American Diabetes Association&#x02019;s 2015 position statement, care for patients with T2DM should include antiglycemic therapy and cardiovascular risk reduction through weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Wagner&#x02019;s chronic care model (CCM) has informed how care should be delivered for patients with T2DM to help achieve these goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The CCM emphasizes whole-person care by addressing physical, mental health, and psychosocial needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Evidence shows patients with diabetes benefit from CCM-based approaches in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], including comprehensive diabetes self-management education (DSME) and self-management support (SMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Notably, SMS can decrease the burden of diabetes and improve diabetes distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Shared medical appointments (SMAs) can help practices efficiently and effectively provide DSME and SMS consistent with the CCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. SMAs are &#x0201c;groups of patients meeting over time for comprehensive care, usually involving a practitioner with prescribing privileges, for a defining chronic condition or health care state&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis showed diabetes SMAs lead to significantly greater improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood pressure compared to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, there was heterogeneity in these effects, suggesting some SMA models may be more effective than others. SMAs can vary in terms of the curriculum used, professional background of group facilitators, the frequency, duration, and number of group sessions, the number and types of patients involved, whether it is a closed or open group (same patients each time or patients can come and go from the group), involvement of family members, involvement of diabetes peer mentors, and topic selection (set order and emphasis on topics or flexible topic selection in which patients pick from a menu).</p><p id="Par26">A key conclusion of the systematic review was the lack of evidence for which SMA features are most effective for improving outcomes important to patients and practices. Upon engaging primary care practices, diabetes patients and family members, and representatives from community health organizations in research prioritization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], our stakeholders endorsed testing professionally led group visits using a curriculum that addressed both physical and mental health aspects of managing diabetes. The stakeholders wanted evidence on several key SMA features, including the relative value of behavioral health providers as members of a multidisciplinary care team delivering SMAs, standardizing educational topics versus supporting patient choice of topics and topic order, and including diabetes peer mentors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to support patients during and outside of group sessions. The Invested in Diabetes study was designed to test comparative effectiveness of diabetes SMAs with and without these key features.</p><p id="Par27">The purpose of the Invested in Diabetes study is to compare effectiveness of two diabetes SMA models varying in these key features (multidisciplinary care teams, peer support, and flexible topic emphasis and order): standardized and patient-driven SMAs.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Intervention conceptual model</title><p id="Par28">This study adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines for reporting clinical trials (SPIRIT Checklist, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The conceptual model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) underlying the distinction between comparator SMA models is based on self-determination theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and principles of whole-person care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. According to SDT, human motivation and behavior are a function of the social environment and the extent to which that environment supports basic psychological needs enhancing &#x0201c;self-determined motivation.&#x0201d; Considerable evidence supports SDT; studies show people tend to be more motivated to engage in an intervention and change their behavior when the intervention supports the need for autonomy (respect for choice and preference), competence (building self-efficacy, recognizing capacity for change), and relatedness (sense of belonging, understanding an individual&#x02019;s values) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Key factors of SDT have been found to mediate improvement in outcomes in diabetes self-management studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

To support competence, the curriculum emphasizes building skills (e.g. problem solving, goal setting, communication skills) and enhancing self-efficacy. In the standardized SMA model, a single healthcare team member will deliver this curriculum following a set topic order, with a set amount of time to cover each topic. To further emphasize a whole-person orientation to care, in the patient-driven model of SMAs, the curriculum will be delivered by a multidisciplinary care team, including health educators, behavioral health providers, and peer mentors.</p><p id="Par30">To enhance autonomy, patients in the patient-driven arm will select the topics they want and need at that particular point in time (i.e. choose the topics and the order in which they are presented). To support relatedness, the patient-driven model of SMA is co-facilitated by diabetes peer mentors, who are also available to patients outside of the group visit setting for individual meetings. The distinguishing features between the patient-driven and standardized models of SMA&#x02014;multidisciplinary care team with peer support and patient-driven content&#x02014;are the elements that represent a more patient-centered social and clinical context. These needs-supportive elements of the patient-driven approach may enhance self-determined motivation and help overcome barriers to diabetes self-management behaviors, thereby enhancing self-management resulting in improved glycemic control and patient-centered outcomes such as diabetes distress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p id="Par31">The study aims for Invested in Diabetes are to:

TTIM was selected for this study by our stakeholders because it met the criteria for having both physical and mental health topics and had a version specific to diabetes. The Invested in Diabetes team adapted the diabetes version of TTIM for this study context based on stakeholder input, as part of the implementation framework described below. Adaptations included reorganizing content to fit within six sessions of 2 h rather than 12 sessions of 1 h, adding content on general stress and coping skills to supplement content focused on mental illness management alone, and updating nutrition and physical activity content based on recent evidence and guidelines. The TTIM modules and when they are covered in each study arm are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Module 4 has two versions, one for a general population of patients with T2DM (stress and coping content) and one for a population of patients with T2DM and co-occurring mental illness (mental illness and coping content). Practices choose whichever version fits their patient population. The TTIM manual includes instructions and scripts for group facilitators, patient handouts and home exercises, and visuals that can be projected on a monitor.

The REP framework helps to guide study teams through the process of engaging practice implementation teams in packaging evidence-based interventions and refining study protocols to best align with practice priorities, workflows, resources, and preferences. The REP implementation process involves a pre-condition phase (e.g. packaging intervention for training and assessment using stakeholder input), a pre-implementation phase (e.g. orientation, explain core elements, customize delivery, logistics planning, staff training, and technical assistance), an implementation phase (e.g. ongoing support and partnership, booster training, fidelity monitoring), and a maintenance and evolution phase (e.g. understanding requirements for sustainability).</p><p id="Par44">Consistent with Enhanced REP, Invested in Diabetes study practices receive the following implementation support: access to condition-specific TTIM materials on the study website; a one-day condition-specific training for any care team member who will deliver TTIM; a 1-h training for anyone who will serve as a prescribing provider; and 4&#x02013;6 facilitation sessions with a practice coach. The coach helps practices create tailored workflows to prepare for and conduct SMAs, addresses logistical issues such as physical space for SMAs and prescribing provider visits, scheduling groups, and billing and reimbursement, helps plan strategies for identifying, recruiting, and retaining eligible patients, and serves as a liaison to the study team for data collection purposes. In patient-driven practices, coaches guide practices in selecting peer mentors; peer mentors are invited to participate in TTIM trainings with practice care team members, when possible, and are invited a 5-h peer mentor training. Practice representatives are invited to join quarterly condition-specific conference calls, as a learning community for sharing experiences and problem-solving around SMA delivery and sustainability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcomes and measures</title><p id="Par45">The outcomes for this study are organized by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The use of implementation strategies described by REP will be used to ensure practices maintain fidelity to intervention protocols while supporting appropriate adaptation to their unique needs and resources. By packaging the study and curriculum to align with practice needs and interests, and providing practice facilitation to support practice change, implementation of SMAs should be done faithfully to the protocol &#x02013; helping ensure that resulting findings reflect a true test of the SMA features under investigation.</p><p id="Par78">Finally, the Invested in Diabetes study was developed in collaboration with patients with diabetes, their care partners, and clinicians from participating practices. Research questions, outcomes, and intervention content were selected by these stakeholders, so that resulting findings may better inform clinical and operational decisions for healthcare professionals treating patients with diabetes. A robust mixed methods evaluation will seek to thoroughly confirm or refute study hypotheses, while providing elaborative detail. In conducting this study, we hope to inform future care models for the many individuals who have diabetes, helping them better achieve diabetes control, reduce diabetes distress, and increase both longevity and quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par79">This manuscript describes version 2 of our protocol, last updated 7 March 2019.
