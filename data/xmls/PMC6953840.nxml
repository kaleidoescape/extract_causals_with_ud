Through a two-phase feasibility study among Indian students living in the Delhi area, we longitudinally examined the following: (1) the daily eating-fasting cycles of students (N = 34) in school and college using smartphones as they transition from high school (aged 13&#x02013;15 years; n<sub>IX</sub> = 13) to higher secondary school (HSSS; 16&#x02013;18 years; n<sub>XII</sub> = 9) to their first year (FY) of college (18&#x02013;19 years; n<sub>FC</sub> = 12); and (2) daily activity-rest cycles and light-dark exposure of 31 higher secondary school students (HSSS) using actigraphy. In phase 1, students&#x02019; food data were analyzed for temporal details of eating events and observable differences in diet composition, such as an energy-dense diet (fast food (FF)), as confounding factors of circadian health. Overall, the mean eating duration in high school, higher secondary and FY college students ranged from 14.1 to 16.2h. HSSS exhibited the shortest night fasting. Although FY college students exhibited the highest fast food percentage (FF%), a positive correlation between body mass index (BMI) and FF% was observed only among HSSS. Furthermore, the body weight of HSSS was significantly higher, indicating that FF, untimely eating and reduced night fasting were important obesity-associated factors in adolescents. Reduced night fasting duration was also related to shorter sleep in HSSS. Therefore, food data were supplemented with wrist actigraphy, i.e., activity-rest data, in HSSS. Actigraphy externally validated the increased obesogenic consequences of deregulated eating rhythms in HSSS. CamNtech motion watches were used to assess the relationship between disturbed activity cycles of HSSS and other circadian clock-related rhythms, such as sleep. Less than 50% of Indian HSSS slept 6 hours or more per night. Seven of 31 students remained awake throughout the night, during which they had more than 20% of their daily light exposure. Three nonparametric circadian rhythm analysis (NPCRA) variables revealed circadian disruption of activity in HSSS. The present study suggests that inappropriate timing and quality of food and sleep disturbances are important determinants of circadian disruptions in adolescents attending school.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funds for the study but support in form of Actiwatches for the study was provided by Prof. Satchidananda Panda for this work</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Longitudinal studies on circadian rhythms are needed to support the contemporary prognosis of feeding-fasting and sleep-wake rhythm disruption in adolescents. Lifestyle traits such as faulty food habits and poor sleep are critical risk factors in young adults and can contribute to the development of psychopathological alterations later in life [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Studies reveal that adhering to traditional healthy food influences adolescents&#x02019; daily feeding behavior [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], indicating that a high-calorie diet is associated with meal irregularity. Although food type [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], frequency and circadian timing of meals have synergistic effects on individual health [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] at all ages, adolescent diets and circadian health merit special attention. Biologically, adolescence marks an age when the fundamental properties of the circadian timekeeping system change and develop [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Socially, the daily routines of students change as they transition from high school to higher secondary schools [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227002.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Psychologically, study pressures and reduced school connectedness lower their mental health [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We propose that untimely eating and diminished sleep alongside pubertal changes negatively impact the well-being of adolescents attending school.</p><p>On the Indian subcontinent, 23.1% [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] of the 243 million adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] lead urban lives, and 77% of these adolescents attend school. Adolescents study in school at two levels: high school (aged 13&#x02013;15 years) and higher secondary school (16&#x02013;18 years). Most of the schools in these age groups have a uniform pattern of school curricula, rendering common study structures and grading systems across the country. Thus, there are some education system commonalities among Indian adolescents, which include less emphasis on practical learning and physical education and the use of marks/exam scores as primary indicators of success. Implicitly, the daily routine commonalities among adolescents attending school include late-night studying, a larger focus on short-term goals, attraction to fast food (FF) and weekday/weekend switches in daily eating and sleeping routines. All these traits lead to circadian disruption and need to be comprehensively investigated. Our earlier study suggesting the disruption of daily eating rhythms [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in Indian adults could not be extended to students attending school, who might experience a different nature of fluctuations in food routines, more frequent variations in taste(s) for food types, etc. The transition from high school adolescent life to young adult college life witnesses marked changes in access to FF and time(s) of daily food intake [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, there is no study describing the daily sleep patterns of Indian adolescents who attend school.</p><p>Circadian rhythms have a consolidative role in organismal physiology. Studies have shown that molecular circadian clockwork and time of food intake interactively enable temporal re-appropriation of organismal energy budgeting and optimize health [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227002.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Likewise, eating wisely through the right time of day confers a survival advantage by resetting various cellular and tissue functions to the correct time of day; thus, this eating pattern has the potential to correct circadian misalignment [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Intervention studies in mice [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227002.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in which the time of food intake was restricted (hence, time-restricted eating (TRE)) to 8&#x02013;10 hours a day revealed that TRE had the potential to reverse the predisposition to metabolic disorder. However, mice and humans are different physiologically, genetically and even ecologically [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In animal model studies, food intake largely depends on food administered, whereas human food eating behavior has several confounding factors viz. age, busy-ness, eating preferences, urbanization, light exposure, moods, socioeconomic status, and health awareness. Therefore, factual and evidence-driven descriptions of what and when people actually eat must precede human intervention studies [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227002.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227002.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>A scientific testing of public notions, such as the influence of caloric diet on circadian disruption, must be tested in light of the cumulative influence of multiple factors (such as reduced sleep, less activity, artificial light at night) on circadian health [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, the differences in obesogenic consequences of high caloric food consumption between Indian high school and HSSS [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] could be associated with study-related stress, reduced sleep, activity and even Indian culture [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The inverse relationship between sleep duration and weight status has revealed the importance of sleep in nutritional health [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition to sleep, ambient light regulates human circadian rhythms by regulating melatonin production from the pineal gland and by influencing sleep initiation and maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Cross-sectional and longitudinal actigraphy is a standard method [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to determine the relationship between disturbed activity cycles and other circadian clock-related rhythms. Therefore, to externally validate the constituent factors augmenting the extent of daily rhythm deregulation [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in food cycles of HSSS, observations on activity/rest and light exposure data were made using wrist actigraphy. Three nonparametric circadian rhythm analysis (NPCRA) variables helpful in validation of &#x0201c;actimetric sleep&#x0201d; were calculated using motion-watch software tools [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These characteristics, i.e., relative amplitude (RA), intradaily variability (IV) and interdaily stability (IS), tested the fragmentation and synchronization of the sleep-wake cycle. Herein, the relative amplitude ranges between maximum and minimum levels of activity. Intradaily variability (IV) is a measure of the degree of fragmentation and denotes the frequency and extent of hourly transitions between periods of rest and activity. Interdaily stability (IS) estimates the strength of coupling external cue-triggering activity and indicates synchronization to the 24-h light-dark cycle.</p><p>Substantial chronobiological research is dedicated to the mechanisms and genetic bases of biological clocks [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Fewer studies have identified relevant societal perturbations that contribute to daily rhythm deregulation. These descriptive approaches append the effectiveness of studies targeting an ultimate human benefit. Therefore, a preliminary multifactorial feasibility study was performed in two phases using a combination of 1) daily eating patterns among Indian school students studying in classes IX and XII and FY of college and 2) longitudinal monitoring of diurnal changes in the intensity patterns of the free-living activity and light exposure of higher secondary school students (HSSS), which would help delineate the lifestyle of school students and establish the relative importance of causal factors to circadian disruption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for food pattern study</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the human ethics committee (HEC) of MMH College, Ghaziabad, India. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) students were enrolled in class IX, class XII or FY of college and were aged, respectively, 13&#x02013;15, 16&#x02013;18 or 18&#x02013;19 years at inclusion; (2) their parents agreed that mobile data capturing was not detrimental to studies; and (3) they had continued access to a mobile device (provided by the researcher) at home or school. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) undergoing any weight-loss/weight-gain program, having suffered a sickness or disease or having taken appetite-related medication in the past 6 months; (2) having taken any psychoactive drugs in the past two years; (3) having a history of seizures or any condition that prevented them from participating in school activities in the past 2 years; (4) discouraged by class teachers, based on discipline records; (5) undertook travel during the study; (6) stayed in school/college hostel; (7) having special needs; (8) having a medical illness requiring immediate treatment; and (9) having a disinterest/inability to commit to the regularity of food picture capturing. In addition to obtaining students&#x02019; consent to participate, we also collected parental consent for their child to be part of the study. We also obtained permission from the school administrator for student(s) to participate in the study, as cell phone use is forbidden in many high schools in India.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>A camera phone method to collect eating pattern data</title><p>Questionnaire-based methods or food diaries to collect eating behavior often lack the circadian aspect of eating behavior and its variation from day to day. In phase 1, data capturing was performed using mobile phone cameras. Data collection and analysis were performed as published earlier [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, food metadata were collected from study participants attending school who took pictures of every ingestion event for 21 days using the phone handset provided and by study participants attending college using their personal phone handsets. In either case, food pictures were manually downloaded, time-stamped and annotated by researchers.</p><p>Initially, in the food eating pattern study, 7 schools were approached, of which 2 schools allowed the researchers to contact students for enrollment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Fifty-six students and parents consented to participate. Of these students, 18 dropped out and 4 were irregular; as such, we obtained the daily eating-fasting cycle data of 34 student volunteers using smart phones, namely, students studying in high school (aged 13&#x02013;15 years; n<sub>IX</sub> = 13), higher secondary school (aged 16&#x02013;18 years; n<sub>XII</sub> = 9; HSSS), and their first year (FY) of college (aged 18&#x02013;19 years; n<sub>FC</sub> = 12). Ten functional camera phone handsets (Nokia C1 with data storage but without server connectivity) with 2GB memory cards were given to recruited students after prescreening and consent. They were asked to record all of their food and beverage (including water) intake, irrespective of serving size, and save the pictures in their phone. The students from one college were contacted via flyers, who after consent, were directly recruited by the researcher. College authorities were not involved at any stage. These students used their personal mobile phones for food data recoding. After 21 days of food data capture, these students visited the lab where the researcher saved the pictures to a computer.</p><fig id="pone.0227002.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227002.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow diagram showing student recruitment in two phases of the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0227002.g001"/></fig><p>At the beginning and end of the study, height and weight were measured using a weighing scale and tape measure at the school health center/laboratory. At times when the participants could not or forgot to take a picture of the food, they sent messages to the researcher mentioning food items and the approximate time of ingestion. The researcher was in continuous yet random contact with volunteers to remind them to take pictures. The timing of ingestion for each participant data was examined for reporting compliance. Data were considered complete if the user logged at least 3 items every day (compliant day) and had 14 compliant days within 21 days of data collection.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Calorie estimation from food pictures</title><p>After 21 days, the pictures from their cameras were downloaded and analyzed for time stamps and food pictures. All participants were allocated a unique ID for anonymity, in accordance with the ICMR guidelines of India. Picture details were manually annotated using a database from CalorieKing, MyFitnessPal websites and the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) website of the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference to assess the caloric values of food items. In essence, food item name and portion size were visually assessed and cross-checked with a follow-up questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is important to reiterate that in India, especially for home-cooked food, the portion sizes often include multiple servings. Thus, the pictures taken within 5 minutes were treated as a single meal. A single picture with less food was standardized with a student&#x02019;s self-reported information; for example, if a student reported that his normal diet comprised two chapattis, then even if his picture(s) showed one chapatti in the meal(s), we considered the volume to be equivalent to two chapattis.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Assessment of quality, quantity and timing of ingestion</title><p>Analyses of all pictures led to 173 distinct food/beverage items in the present study. These items were broadly grouped into water, FF or processed food, and natural or prepared food categories, depending on criteria such as commercial availability, caloric size per 100 grams and ease of access. A total of 102 food items were categorized as high caloric/energy dense/FF. The caloric content per 100 grams of traditional food (all nuts, fresh fruits, pulses, vegetables, chapatti, white rice, milk, tea, etc.) ranged from 2.00 to 270 Kcal, with an average of 143.6 Kcal. The calorie content of 100 grams of different FF items (chips, desserts, pizzas, burgers, and snacks (including cream biscuits, stuffed Indian paratha, fried foods, etc.)) ranged from 22.5 to 750 Kcal, with an average of 276.7 Kcal. The listed items were added to individual meals as per portion size assessed. The reported daily caloric intake for each participant was calculated from their food pictures on compliant days. The resting energy expenditure for each individual was calculated using the modified Harris-Benedict equation [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The data after quantitation were transferred to Graph Pad Prism software (version 7.0), San Diego, CA, USA, for representation and statistical analysis. We used t-tests and one-way ANOVA as applicable and considered p-values &#x0003c; 0.05 as significant. The timing of first to last caloric intake during the day was used to calculate the daily eating time window or eating duration, within which a person had a 95% probability of eating (between 2.5 and 97.5 percentile interval of all time-stamps in a day). For food data, a metabolic day was considered to begin at 4.00 a.m., such that the feeding duration of students ranged from 04:00 to 03:59 a.m. the next day (or 04&#x02013;28 hours) [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. All events at the time of eating reported by all participants were pooled, and the frequency distribution of eating events within a one-hour bin over 24 hours of the day was derived. Students who frequently forgot to take food pictures were excluded.</p><p>We aimed to track daily eating patterns, assess food habits and test the inclination of adolescents towards high caloric FF through schooling transitions with age.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Sleep, activity and light exposure patterns among adolescent students</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for actigraphy study</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the HEC, MMH College, Ghaziabad, India. Data were collected from students of one public school in the Delhi area. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) students were enrolled in class XII, and (2) they agreed to wear motion-watches (CamNtech motion-watch 8, Motion-watch<sup>TM</sup>) on their nondominant hand for 15 days. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) frequently forgot to wear the watch, (2) had a swimming routine, (3) discouraged by class teacher for reasons such as discipline, (4) undertook travel during the study, (5) had special needs, and (6) was not interested in the study.</p><p>In study phase 2, 43 students were approached to wear the motion-watch. Of these students, 12 dropped out and 31 contributed to the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Motion-watches were initialized with a 1-minute epoch interval. Participants were asked to wear the motion-watch at all times (except when bathing) and to press &#x0201c;event marker&#x0201d; button when getting in and out of bed. A diary was provided to document unusual activities during the day that might impact the recording (e.g., device removal during sports or gym activities). Days with &#x0003e;4 hours of missing data were excluded. In certain cases, for a &#x0003c;1-hour duration, missing activity values were imputed on the basis of subject-specific average over all of the recording days at the same time period. Data of the total activity in 1440 bins (in 1-minute epochs) from 00:00 hours of day 1 to 11:59 hours of day 1 were averaged into 48 half-hour bins and summed up to the total activity in a day. Unlike a food study, in which the metabolic day is considered to start at 04.00 hours, sleep-wake data are described using 00:00 a.m. as 0 hours. An eight-hour window between 22:00 hours and 06:00 hours was considered night-sleep time. Activity/light during this period indicated &#x0201c;awake&#x0201d; status if the activity exceeded 499 MW counts per minute and the light &#x0003e;80 lux. The data of each volunteer plotted in 48 half-hour bins per day were normalized to account for interdevice variability. Due to the lack of clear onsets, offsets and fragmented patterns in quantified rest-activity circadian rhythms, data were analyzed for NPCRA.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Challenges in collecting longitudinal eating pattern data</title><p>In contrast to adults, the collection of objective food consumption data from adolescents through smartphones was challenging with respect to schools, families and students.

id="sec017"><title>Discussion</title><p>The increasing concern for the rise of lifestyle-related issues in adolescents is largely based on data projections of questionnaire-based surveys and/or diary recall. First, these methods lack evidence, and second, they are highly subjective, with retrospective influence on volunteer reporting. A smartphone capture-based approach [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] minimizes such glitches in human longitudinal studies involving eating behavior (<xref rid="pone.0227002.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, despite the better availability of relatively inexpensive data plans in India to date, the present study employed inexpensive camera phones instead of apps/fully functional smartphones to collect nutrition data to satisfy school regulations, especially for high and higher secondary school students. In food eating pattern studies, the possibility of false negatives arising from an inability to report or forgetting to report cannot be ruled out. The body weight of the students was also not affected by the acquisition of nutrition data. Nevertheless, actual energy intake for school students was higher than the resting energy expenditure (REE) calculated, ruling out an adverse effect of capturing food data on daily food intake.</p><p>Despite the small cohort size, there were clear differences in duration (time from first caloric ingestion to last meal of day), frequency, quality and caloric quantity of daily food intake among high school, higher secondary school and FY college students. High school students and FY college students exhibited a median duration of eating of ~14 hours, which was less than that of HSSS. The latter exhibited a 16.36-hour daily duration of eating. Although maximum FF% was observed in the FY college students&#x02019; diets, HSSS had a higher BMI, indicating a negative effect of a longer eating duration, i.e. reduced night fasting. The qualitative assessment of food consumption also supported the adverse impact of reduced night fasting in HSSS, such that they exhibited a positive correlation between FF% and BMI. This finding is consistent with an earlier view suggesting that eating later in the day enhances the chances of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227002.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The differences in eating pattern became conspicuous when plotted in hourly bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3C</xref>). High school students exhibited four different times of peak eating events, with the largest peak at 21&#x02013;22 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g003">Fig 3A and 3D</xref>), which suggests a postprandial assimilation of food at night and, hence, night hyperglycemia [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, these adolescents have school starting at 06.00/07.00 a.m. in the morning, as evident from the first (morning) peak of ingestion events. Inadvertently, night fasting seldom exceeded 9 hours, since it takes up to 2 hours to assimilate food, which implied up to 7 hours of rest to the liver. Even &#x0003e;50% of inter-meal gaps are less than 5 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Such reduced night fasting is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>We expected a conventional three-meals-a-day pattern of eating among school students. However, any such daily pattern was largely absent. High school students exhibited a higher number of ingestion events in the morning, before school, during tiffin break, after school and at dinner time. They also exhibited more than a 60-minute delay in the first ingestion event on the weekends. There was larger variation in daily eating duration in HSSS than in high school and FY college students (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). An earlier study on the eating patterns of Indian urban adults revealed larger variation in dinner than in breakfast times [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The present observations for students were similar to those for adults, as these students also exhibited larger variation in the last meal of the day. Weekday-weekend differences in the duration of eating were significant among HSSS and FY college students. Metabolic homeostasis misaligns with the mistiming of food, altering glucose and energy metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The daily eating patterns in hourly bins did not exhibit clear daytime peaks in HSSS, indicating disruption of daily rhythms of eating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>). A number of caloric intake events were spread throughout the day, less than half of which occurred before 05.00 p.m. Herein again, approximately 50% of inter-meal gaps were less than 5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). The lack of lunch/dinner peaks indicates meal irregularity. Such erratic eating patterns are associated with a reduction in the thermic effect of food and higher glucose responses, thus reducing metabolic health [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the present study, we observed not only greater meal irregularity among HSSS but also larger meal sizes (i.e., greater FFc%), which were positively correlated with an increase in BMI, thus increasing the possibility of long-term weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The FY college students exhibited nearly three inconspicuous peaks in the number of ingestion events. Additionally, the number of events per volunteer was lower by at least 10&#x02013;15% compared to those for school students (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g003">Fig 3C and 3F</xref>). The college students&#x02019; data revealed that 1) the first ingestion event was ~2 hours later than that of school students and 2) they had greater ease of access to FF during the day. Unlike school students and more similar to adults [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], approximately 40% of ingestion events occurred among college students by noon. Although they exhibited better night fasting than school students, half of the inter-meal gaps occurred in less than 5 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). An increase in the energy-dense diet characterized the food quality of college students.</p><p>Dietary quality was an important parameter studied. FF comprised 2/5 of the total caloric intake. It has been widely investigated that mice randomly eating a high-fat diet tend to develop metabolic diseases faster than those eating a normal diet (16, 17). This is because a high-fat, energy-dense diet, along with disruptions in eating patterns, overrides the circadian clock. Energy-dense diets have pleiotropic effects that lead to the reprogramming of the metabolic and transcriptional liver pathways. Many oscillating transcripts and metabolites are phase-advanced by fast food, disrupting the circadian clock [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It cannot be ruled out that the lack of a positive relationship between FF% and daily duration of eating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227002.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) in the present study might have resulted from the small cohort size and needs to be further investigated.</p><p>We observed wakeful activities far into the night among HSSS. Owens [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reviewed the sleep patterns in American adolescents, factors contributing to chronic sleep loss, and reported that sleep impairments are an important public health issue. Sleep restriction is a serious threat to the academic success and safety of adolescents, resulting in health-related consequences, such as depression and increased obesity risk. The actimetry data in HSSS also confirmed the reduced availability of sleep hours. A late-night sleep onset ranging from 11.30 p.m. to 01.00 a.m. in 3/4 of the cohort was alarming [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In another study, the influence of the sleep patterns of 2,259 adolescent students was examined using latent growth cross-domain models. It was reported that students who obtained less sleep exhibited lower initial self-esteem and higher initial levels of depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The strength of this study is evidence-driven data capturing all subjects within a narrow age and socioeconomic range. Disruption in the daily food rhythms of adolescents indicated an intricate relationship with disrupted sleep-activity rhythms during follow-up. The measurement and comparison of sleep, activity level and light exposure in Indian high school students has never been performed before.</p><p>Our feasibility study on school students has many limitations. We have not measured circadian phase markers such as urinary melatonin, so we missed a circadian misalignment interpretation of some important observations, such as &#x02018;no night sleep&#x02019;, in nonsleeper HSSS. Although stress could have affected volunteer sleep characteristics, we did not include students&#x02019; self-reported mood or stress because stress hormone(s) were not measured. Additionally, the cohort size was small in the food eating pattern study and sleep/light monitoring. Recruiting students from public schools to match the socioeconomic status of students was a precaution taken to minimize the study biases. Public school students mainly hail from the middle-income group, or the part of society focused on &#x0201c;education for employment&#x0201d;. Therefore, in India, similar to a few other countries, the self-worth of a student in the middle-income group is determined by academic success and grades, thus increasing students&#x02019; pressure to learn. India is top rated among suicides resulting from class XII exam failures [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our study highlights intricate lifestyle issues that are detrimental to adolescent health, and the present study increases the scope for corrective interventions. Logan and McClung [<xref rid="pone.0227002.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] recently proposed that brain disorders and circadian dysfunction are correlational, and conditional interventions, such as morning bright light therapy and better sleep hygiene during adolescence, can help reduce CNS disorders.</p><p>In addition to a baseline for future intervention studies in school students, the present study highlights circadian disruptions in feeding-fasting and activity-rest cycles in Indian school students and should be circulated for outreach and awareness purposes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the volunteers for their anonymous contributions and Prof. Satchidananda Panda of the SALK Institute of Biological Sciences, USA, for suggestions during the preparation of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227002.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Brand</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kirov</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>. <article-title>Sleep and its importance in adolescence and in common adolescent somatic and psychiatric conditions</article-title>. <source>Int J Gen Med</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>4</volume>:<fpage>425</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>442</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2147/IJGM.S11557</pub-id>

</p><p>Responses to Reviewer's Questions</p><p>Reviewer #1: Despite of the limited cohort size, the results show concerning data about rhythmic misalignment in adolescents. There are not a lot of studies focusing on this group. Those information should be important in developing public policies to reduce this problem.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The present manuscript has provided an insight for the daily lifestyles of young students and their feeding-fasting and rest activity cycles. I have few minor comments and questions regarding the present manuscript:</p><p>1. The presents study did not explain about the male and female students in all the groups of the study? Please justify the number of male and females in each group.</p><p>***Thank you for pointing out. Added in table 1. </p><p>2. And also provide the caloric differences between male and female group.</p><p>***Thank you for pointing out, and that there is no significant difference (small cohort) among males and females in any of the three groups.</p><p>3. In figure 2C and 2D why there is high deviation in High school group weight and eating duration?</p><p>***only one student of High school group exhibited last mealtime between 22 hrs-26 hrs (late night eating) among high school students, but could not be ignored due to small cohort size. Similarly, one obese High school volunteer might&#x02019;ve affected BMI data. Our purpose for BMI graphing was to compare initial and final values and its correlation with other study variables.</p><p>4. In result section under heading Daily eating patterns and body weight. You have written 651 days of recording. Is study was carried for approximately 2 years? If yes than it would be great if you can provide the change in caloric intake of each group in relation to seasonal changes.</p><p>***Although the data collection spread over 3 years, the number 651 days indicates the potential days when data was recorded and included in the study. Normally food data capturing by students could not be conducted near summer vacation(May-July) or half yearly (sept-Oct) of final exam (Feb-March) time, therefore, seasonal changes need to be studied separately.</p><p>5. In result section under heading Timing of daily caloric intake your paragraph second where you discuss about Fig 3. </p><p>***Corrected. Thank you.</p><p>The labelling of figure 3 and results are not similar 3C is written twice in figure.</p><p>*** Thank you for pointing out, the mismatch was due to labelling error in figure during copyedit. Corrected. Hope it is in order now.</p><p>6. In result section under heading quantity of daily caloric intake why their is high FFc% among FY student? Do they have more preference to high sugar food or high fat food?</p><p>***Yes. Thanks for this important observation; FY students consumed more fast-food, but this FF consumption was restricted to day-time hours (Fig. 3F).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0227002.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227002.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Challet</surname><given-names>Etienne</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Etienne Challet</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Etienne Challet</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0227002" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
