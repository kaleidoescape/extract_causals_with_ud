For a long time, scientists have tried their best to overcome the structural recalcitrance and time-consuming degradation process of plant biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Detailed in structure, cellulose and hemicellulose are the most abundant natural polysaccharides, where the former exists mostly as a crystalline structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the latter exists as a mixture of xylan, glucomannan, arabinogalactan, xyloglucan and galactoglucomannan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hemicellulose is usually decorated with various side-chain substituents, such as acetyl, &#x003b1;-arabinosyl, &#x003b1;-glucuronyl and 4-<italic>O</italic>-methylglucuronycyl residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a complex phenolic polymer, lignin is composed of three monolignol monomers that can be methoxylated to various degrees: <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol. These lignols are incorporated into lignin in the form of the phenylpropanoid <italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) units, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Finally, by physical and chemical forces, all three different polymers form a 3D microstructure in the plant cell wall, which is very stable and shows strong resistance to hydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">So far, plant biomass is widely used in two areas: biofuel and bioorganic fertilizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], in which filamentous fungi are employed as the plant biomass-degraders for their highly efficient secretion of many synergistic enzymes, such as cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinases and ligninases. However, it is still a challenge to completely degrade plant biomass in an economical amount of time just with the secreted enzymes from filamentous fungi. In the biofuel industry, acid or alkaline pretreatment is used and will partly destroy and significantly loosen the entire stable structure of plant biomass, thus providing a less recalcitrant and much more accessible material for the hydrolytic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similarly, in the field of bioorganic fertilizer, amino acids with animal origins are added into plant biomass for highly efficient fermentation by functional filamentous fungi, aiming to supply nutrients, slightly pretreat and prevent the growth of other microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Certainly, all of these treatments would significantly change the subsequent environmental pH of the next step regardless of biofuel or bioorganic fertilizer production. Additionally, biological organic fertilizer containing the functional filamentous fungi would be applied to different farmlands, which have fluctuant natural pH values ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These facts drew our attention to investigate the effect of pH on the growth of filamentous fungi, or more specifically, focus on the effect of pH on the regulation of lignocellulases in functional filamentous fungi.</p><p id="Par14">pH regulation of lignocellulases in filamentous fungi has already been investigated previously. For example, in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, XlnB (xylanase) and AbfB (&#x003b1;-<sc>l</sc>-arabinofuranosidase) were acid-expressed, while XlnA (xylanase) was alkaline-expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, protein gel identification showed that three hydrolases (&#x003b1;-1,2-mannosidase, &#x003b1;-<sc>l</sc>-arabinofuranosidase and &#x003b2;-1,3-glucosidase) were up or specifically accumulated at pH 4.0, while four other hydrolases (exocellulase, arabinogalactan endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-galactosidase, rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase and exoarabinanase) were up or specifically accumulated at pH 6.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Transcriptome analysis of <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> also indicated that a series of genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases were selectively induced under various pH values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, deeper studies revealed that a pH regulatory system could be mediated by the transcription factor of PacC, which was responsible for differential protein expression at different pH values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It was reported that knocking out the <italic>pacC</italic> gene could significantly affect both cellulase and xylanase activities in two model filamentous fungi, <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These previous results showed that a PacC-mediated mechanism likely exists as a general way of regulating lignocellulases in filamentous fungi. However, only portions of enzymes or sporadic indirect pieces of evidence (transcriptome sequencing) were provided in those previous studies, and very few studies have tried to entirely investigate the change in all proteins in response to pH in a filamentous fungus.</p><p id="Par15"><italic>Trichoderma guizhouense</italic> NJAU4742 strain, which was isolated from compost, was widely used as a functional active component of biological organic fertilizer. In this study, NJAU4742 strain was fermented at different initial pH values to investigate the effects on degradation of the sole carbon source (rice straw). In the whole process, the growth conditions and extracellular lignocellulose activities were analyzed in detail. Simultaneously, the proteomic analysis using the Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical fragment ions (SWATH) technique provided a specific description of how pH affected the intracellular and extracellular proteins synthesized by NJAU4742 strain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pre-evaluating the ability of <italic>T. guizhouense</italic> NJAU4742 to degrade rice straw at different pH values in the submerged fermentation</title><p id="Par16">In this study, spores of NJAU4742 strain (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup>/L) were inoculated into triangular flasks containing liquid minimal medium (MM) with a pH ranging from 2.0 to 10.0 and 2% (w/v) rice straw as the sole carbon source. During cultivation at 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 150&#x000a0;rpm, pH changes were determined, and results are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. The growth of NJAU4742 strain could significantly regulate the ambient pH; for example, initial pH values of 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0 were all increased by an average increment of approximately one pH value after the cultivation of NJAU4742 strain for 7&#x000a0;days, but the initial pH values of 2.0, 9.0 and 10.0 remained stable throughout the entire cultivation period. Meanwhile, endoglucanase and xylanase activities were also evaluated for cellulose and hemicellulose degradation abilities, respectively, during the biodegradation process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, c). Consistent with the pH changes, no enzyme activities were detected in the cultivations with the initial pH values of 2.0, 9.0 and 10.0. Surely, both could be explained by the fact that the initial high concentration of H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> could actually inhibit spore germination and further growth of NJAU4742 strain in the submerged fermentation (data not shown). In addition, both the highest xylanase (8.23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.20&#x000a0;U/mL) and exoglucanase (2.19&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06&#x000a0;U/mL) activities were obtained in the treatment with initial pH values of 5.0 in the third and 5th day, respectively. In general, enzyme activities, in fermentations with the initial pH values ranging from 3.0 to 7.0, had no statistical differences between each other (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05), and were all kept in a relatively high level from the 3rd day (the average xylanase activities: 3.84&#x02013;5.02&#x000a0;U/mL, and the average exoglucanase activities: 0.87&#x02013;1.41&#x000a0;U/mL). All these results indicated that <italic>T. guizhouense</italic> NJAU4742 strain preferred acidic environment, and the ambient pH was one of the critical parameters for the lignocellulose utilization by this strain.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The time course of pH changes and enzyme activities under the submerged fermentation in different treatments.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The performance of NJAU4742 strain under solid-state fermentations of rice straw at different pH values</title><p id="Par17">Solid-state fermentation is an important method for cultivating filamentous fungi when used in agriculture or industry. Based on the data obtained from the submerged fermentations, pH values of 2.0, 3.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 9.0 were chosen as the initial ambient pH values for the solid-state fermentations of NJAU4742 strain using rice straw as the sole carbon source. During the fermentation course of 7&#x000a0;days, the spores germinated and grew until large amounts of green mature spores were produced (a complete growth cycle, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). In solid-state fermentation, an initial pH of 6.0 could significantly accelerate the growth of NJAU4742 strain compared to other pH values, and initial pH values of 3.0 and 8.0 could also normally incubate this strain, but with some delay in the growth when compared to the former treatment. Similar to the submerged fermentation, an initial pH of 2.0 completely inhibited the spore germination of NJAU4742 strain, and a relatively small amount of mycelia were observed in the treatment with the initial pH value of 9.0.</p><p id="Par18">The diverse growth conditions showed that different ambient pH values had strong effects on the NJAU4742 strain during the solid-state fermentation process of rice straw, and thus, it was very interesting to investigate the extracellular conditions of lignocellulose degradation in this process. Therefore, the treatments with initial pHs of 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0 (SSF3.0, SSF6.0 and SSF9.0) were chosen for more systematic analysis in detail. First, we detected the releasing amount of carbon dioxide (RCD) under these conditions, and the results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) showed that the RCDs of SSF3.0, SSF6.0 and SSF9.0 all increased rapidly in the first 5&#x000a0;days. Then, the RCDs of SSF6.0 and SSF9.0 dropped rapidly to a similar final amount (3096&#x000a0;ppm and 2235&#x000a0;ppm, respectively) on the 7th day, but the decrease in RCD of SSF3.0 happened after the 6th day. For the values of RCDs, 3.91- or 1.41-fold changes were observed between the highest values of SSF6.0 and SSF9.0 or SSF3.0. These results revealed the following facts: (1) NJAU4742 strain grew the best and had the largest amount of biomass in SSF6.0 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1); (2) sporulation was the predominant reason for the decrease in RCDs; (3) the growth cycle of SSF3.0 was clearly delayed when compared to that of SSF6.0 even though the biomass was equivalent. In addition, NJAU4742 strain in SSF9.0 also had a normal growth cycle but a limited increase in biomass, and this was assumed to be led by the low utilization efficiency of rice straw. The electron microscope analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) indicated that rice straw in SSF9.0 still largely maintained a smooth surface similar to the rice straw without bio-fermentation (control check, CK), in comparison to the total destruction of the rice straw surface structure both in SSF3.0 and SSF6.0. Together with the fact that SSF9.0 also owned the lowest enzyme activities in all treatments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a&#x02013;c, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), including xylanase, endoglucanase and exoglucanase activities, and these results indicated that low utilization efficiency of rice straw in SSF9.0 seemed to be resulted by the low enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw. To verify this viewpoint as mentioned above, we detected the concentrations of extracellular proteins (CEP) in all three treatments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d), and SSF9.0 indeed had the lowest values, but the differences (79% and 67% for SSF3.0 and SSF6.0, respectively) are not enough to completely support the hypothesis that a low amount of secreted enzymes led to an inefficient destruction of rice straw in SSF9.0. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the ambient pH of SSF9.0 was another main reason that largely inhibited all enzyme activities, as it is well known that most secreted cellulases and hemicellulases can only maintain approximately 20% of enzyme activity at pH 9.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The crude enzymes of NJAU4742 strain induced by rice straw were detected to only have 19.13&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.31% of xylanase activity and 1.12&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.07% endoglucanase activity at pH 9.0 when compared to pH 5.0. Therefore, it is necessary to detect the ambient pH in SF9.0, and the results showed that there was no obvious change in pH during the 7-day fermentation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). This high pH of 9.0 extremely affected extracellular enzyme activities and stabilities, and thereby strongly contributed to the growth limitation of high pH. Interestingly, 3.0 was also a value far from the optimal pH of most lignocellulases, but the rice straw in SSF3.0 was effectively utilized. The change profile of pH value in SSF3.0 illustrated that the pH value was rapidly and largely increased as the fermentation continued until reaching a final value of 5.8 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e), which was very close to the optimal pH for most lignocellulases secreted by acidic filamentous fungi. Finally, the pH increases in SSF6.0 was also observed, which indicated that the growth of NJAU4742 strain could significantly eliminate the high concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in two ways: (1) neutralized by the intermediate products released from the rice straw; (2) absorbed and utilized by NJAU4742 strain, or offset by the secretions from NJAU4742 strain. In fact, the results in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f excluded the first mechanism, and thus indicated that the second mechanism is responsible for the pH increase during the solid-state fermentation process.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Solid-state fermentations of rice straw by NJAU4742 strain under the different treatments of SSF3.0, SSF6.0 and SSF9.0.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">In solid-state fermentation, NJAU4742 strain had adapted to a wide environmental pH condition, ranging from 3.0 to 9.0, and showed a distinct preference for the specific pH of 6.0. Beyond adaptation, NJAU4742 strain could also significantly reconstruct the environmental pH condition by alkalinization, in which the pH value was elevated from 3.0 to 6.0 in 5&#x000a0;days. Therefore, it is very interesting to discuss NJAU4742&#x02019;s alkalinization, which is hence hypothesized to be the result of three possible mechanisms: (I) the released components from the degradation of rice straw neutralized the acidic environmental pH; (II) NJAU4742 strain absorbed extracellular H<sup>+</sup> and (III) the secretions of NJAU4742 strain elevated the environmental pH. For hypothesis I, the main components of rice straw contained polysaccharides (cellulose, xylan and mannan) and lignin, however, the released basic units, such as oligosaccharides, glucose, xylose, mannose and aromatic alcohols, actually had little influence on the ambient pH. The components that could alter the ambient pH were pectin and those substituent groups of hemicellulose, of which the complete hydrolysis would release various organic acids, including galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, ferulic acid, <italic>p</italic>-coumalic acid, and acetic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Meanwhile, protein degradation by extracellular proteases could also release various amino acids from the substrate. Apparently, these produced organic acids will function as a reverse to the environmental alkalinization by NJAU4742 strain, and were probably absorbed and utilized rapidly by NJAU4742 strain, much like the produced sugars, and this behavior functioned in regulating ambient pH, which belonged to part of hypothesis II (absorbing extracellular acids). Additionally, the original high concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in SSF3.0 strongly drew attention to an enzyme called the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which was identified and significantly regulated by pH in this study (OPB40853, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This enzyme was generally located on the plasma membrane of plants and fungi, and belonged to the P-type cation-translocating ATPase family. Many previous studies showed that H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases were always regulated by glucose, an acidic pH and weak organic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which existed in solid-state fermentations of NJAU4742 strain and resulted in the highest expression level of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in SSF6.0. The complex regulation of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in the SSF of NJAU4742 strain suggested its relationship with NJAU4742 strain alkalinization, but may also work as a counter for its reported function of pumping H<sup>+</sup> out of the cell to create a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient for nutrient uptake and stabilizing intracellular pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Actually, under such a low pH of 3.0 condition (high natural potential across plasma membrane), it was hard to know whether the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was still needed to work or if there were any possible patterns of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase helping NJAU4742 strain absorb H<sup>+</sup> in some way, which still required a more in-depth study. For hypothesis III, many studies have proposed that fungi could modify the pH of their environment by secreting acids or alkalis. For example, <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> and <italic>Botrytis</italic> sp. could produce oxalic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], while <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. can secrete mainly gluconic and citric acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although pH was slightly dropped in SSF9.0, it was still difficult to judge whether NJAU4742 strain secreted acids in this study, but at least this was not the main determinant for the acidic environment. Some other fungi, such as <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and <italic>Debaryomyces hansenii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and especially for <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], could alkalinize their environment by secreting ammonia, a byproduct during the amino acid metabolic process. By a BLAST search, the homologs of an ammonium transporter of MEPB and three ammonia transporters (ATOs) in this process were found in strain NJAU4742, but no homologs were detected for the critical regulator (Stp2p) and amino acid catabolic enzyme (Ach1p). Among the four detected homologs, only one ATO protein (OPB44235) was identified by SWATH, but its highest expression level in SSF6.0 could not be explained logically. These previous reports of other fungi&#x02019;s alkalinization supported that NJAU4742 strain in this study might elevate the ambient pH by secreting another kind of alkali (not ammonia), which was entirely possible because <italic>C. albicans</italic> also shared multiple mechanisms of environmental alkalinization not only ammonia secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Certainly, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and secondary metabolites were also considered as the possible functional parts of the complex environmental alkalinization of NJAU4742 strain.</p><p id="Par26">In SSF3.0, the growth inhibition of NJAU4742 strain by the low pH was relieved as the ambient pH increased, which indicated that environmental alkalinization determined the growth ability of NJAU4742 strain at pH 3.0. This fact reflects that a complex regulatory system exists for detecting different pH values and further, responding to the pH. The results here clearly showed that extracellular proteins, such as cellulases, hemicellulases and chitinases, were under the regulation of this possible system. Similarly, some cellulase and xylanase genes were also reported to be controlled by the ambient pH in <italic>T. reesei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], <italic>Humicola grisea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and thus together showed the universality of pH regulation of lignocellulases in filamentous fungi. Actually, there are already some reports that the integrity of seven proteins, designated PacC, PalA, PalB, PalC, PalF, PalH and PalI, were responsible for gene regulation at different pH values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Under acidic growth conditions, PacC<sup>72</sup> (72&#x000a0;kDa) is inactive without any known role in transcriptional regulation, but it is converted to PacC<sup>53</sup> (53&#x000a0;kDa) and further to PacC<sup>27</sup> (27&#x000a0;kDa), which is subsequently active and functions in the activation of alkaline-expressed genes and repression of acid-expressed genes. PacC orthologs were found to modulate the expression of cellulolytic genes in response to ambient pH in filamentous fungi, but the effects varied depending on the organisms. For example, deletion of the <italic>pacC</italic> gene in <italic>T. reesei</italic> significantly increased the cellulolytic enzyme activities at neutral pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but the transcriptome analysis showed only a few cellulase- and hemicellulase-encoding genes were clearly under PacC regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], PacC significantly upregulated the expression of cellulolytic genes at alkaline pH, but had a reverse observation in <italic>N. crassa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The homologs of the seven proteins in the whole PacC-mediated system could be detected and encoded in the genome of NJAU4742 strain, and thus suggested that those pH-regulated lignocellulases were possibly under the control of this system. Although none of the homologs appeared in the 1139 identified proteins, further study of PacC-mediated and other possible systems in regulating extracellular enzymes by the ambient pH, will be very interesting.</p><p id="Par27">Obviously, filamentous fungi regulated the secretion of extracellular enzymes by the ambient pH, however, we need to understand the biological significance behind this behavior. The organisms are highly evolved, and thus the secretion adjustment of extracellular enzymes at different pH values is believed to be an adaptive mechanism to ensure better survival in that environment. That means, NJAU4742 strain possibly achieved more efficient degradation of rice straw by adjusting the differential secretion of cellulases and hemicellulases when exposed under the different pH values. Logically, the adjustment is to achieve the optimal synergy of extracellular enzymes under different pH conditions, which possibly could be explained from the different enzymatic properties of cellulases and hemicellulases. And, it is really the fact that cellulases and xylanases from the same filamentous fungus have different enzymatic properties, such as thermostability, optimal temperature, specific activity and functional domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Just like extracellular proteases, they were distinguished as acidic, neutral and alkaline proteases and regulated by the PacC-mediated system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The secreted proteases of NJAU4742 strain also showed significant pH regulation in this study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Besides, Xiong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] reported that xylanase I was most secreted and active at low pH value (4.0), while xylanase III was most secreted and active at high pH value (6.0) in <italic>T. reesei</italic>. Xylanase II was clearly produced at both pH values. These results and analysis clearly support such a judgment that the pH-dependent regulation of extracellular enzymes is probably for achieving higher enzymatic synergy by secreting the optimal enzymes at different pH values, so as to obtain a most efficient degradation of lignocellulose. Certainly, more detailed and in-depth researches need to be carried out to explain this pH-dependent synergy of lignocellulases.</p><p id="Par28">Additionally, we also noticed the stable differential distribution of extracellular enzyme abundances, which was believed to be the result of evolution, as well as a kind of synergistic performance of multiple enzymes. For cellulose degradation, exoglucanase attacked the natural and LPMO-produced ends of crystalline cellulose, and then the products could be hydrolyzed into glucose by &#x003b2;-glucosidase. The high abundance of these three functional enzymes suggested the specific enhancement of the main steps in the degradation of crystalline cellulose, but not including the endoglucanases, which seemed to have difficulties when attacking the middle of the cellulose chain in the crystalline structure. In contrast, endoxylanase was the largest abundant secreted enzyme among all xylanases, corresponding to the fact that endoxylanase could easily attack the whole chain of xylan for its non-crystalline structure. Facing the complex 3D structure of lignocellulose, the differential distribution of extracellular enzymes is indeed likely to be for greater synergy efficiency, and further analyzing this synergy will be very interesting and valuable in biofuel industry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">This study described the performances of NJAU4742 strain during the submerged and solid-state fermentation processes at different initial pH values in detail.

The surface morphologies of different samples were observed by using an S-4800 II field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan). The respiratory rate of NJAU4742 strain during the solid-state fermentation process was evaluated by tracking the release of CO<sub>2</sub>. Briefly, the triangular flasks of solid-state fermentations were sealed with a parafilm 2&#x000a0;h before sampling. When sampling, 20&#x000a0;mL of gas in the triangular flask was extracted with a syringe and then injected into the gas sampling bag (E-SWITCH, China), and the contents of CO<sub>2</sub> was determined by a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A) equipped with Porapak Q column and a flame ionization detector (FID) according to Zhang et al.

Extracellular protein extraction was carried out as follows: 150&#x000a0;mL deionized ddH<sub>2</sub>O was added into triangular flasks, which were then shaken at 180&#x000a0;rpm for 1&#x000a0;h, and the supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 10,000&#x000a0;rpm for 10&#x000a0;min and filtration through a 0.22&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m sterile membrane. The precipitates of the former step were used to prepare the mycelial intracellular proteins, which were extracted by using the NoviPure<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Soil Protein Extraction Kit (MOBIO, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. After that, extracellular and intracellular proteins, both extracted from the same amount of fermentation materials samples (mg&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;dw, protein/substrates), were directly mixed and concentrated by lyophilization and then stored at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Two biological repeats existed for each condition in proteomic analysis.</p><p id="Par35">The whole SWATH analysis was commissioned to a specialized company (GeneCreate, Wuhan, China), and the analysis is described briefly as follows: 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of proteins in each sample were digested by trypsin (Promega, USA) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C overnight, separated by the Strata-X C18 pillar and dried using a vacuum concentration meter. LC&#x02013;ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed on an AB SCIEX nanoLC&#x02013;MS/MS (Triple TOF 5600 plus) system in two phases: data-dependent acquisition (DDA) was followed by SWATH acquisition, where all samples were mixed and detected in DDA, and the resulting data were used as a library for analysis of each sample by SWATH. Spectral library generation and SWATH data processing were performed using skyline version 3.5 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] complying with the following rules: (i) peptides containing modifications and/or shared by different protein entries/isoforms were excluded from selection; (ii) peptides having a ProteinPilot-identified confidence less than 95% were excluded; (iii) up to five fragment ions that were ranked by intensity were chosen; (iv) fragment ions within the SWATH isolation window were excluded from selection; and (v) to control false discovery rate, a random mass shift of Q1 and Q3 m/z strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] was used to create a decoy spectra library for targeted peak extraction, a mass-to-charge tolerance of at most 10&#x000a0;ppm (0.05&#x000a0;m/z) was allowed for both peptide precursor and fragment ion. Fragment ion areas that belonged to one peptide were added to obtain a peptide&#x02019;s abundance, and the total abundance of peptides for a given protein was determined to obtain the protein&#x02019;s abundance. To eliminate the random errors and sample bias, all the data among samples were normalized using the median normalization method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and the mProphet algorithm was used both for sample normalization and for assessing the data confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Bioinformatic analysis</title><p id="Par36">CAZymes annotation was carried out using the hmmscan tool from HMMER software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] to search the dbCAN database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and the output was processed by the script of hmmscan-parser.sh (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/carden24/Bioinformatics_scripts/blob/master/hmmscan-parser.sh">https://github.com/carden24/Bioinformatics_scripts/blob/master/hmmscan-parser.sh</ext-link>).
