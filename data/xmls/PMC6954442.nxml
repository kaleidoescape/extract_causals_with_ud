Most contemporary domain insertion profiling approaches rely on DNA transposons, which are constrained by sequence bias. Here, we establish <bold>S</bold>aturated <bold>P</bold>rogrammable <bold>In</bold>sertion <bold>E</bold>ngineering (SPINE), an unbiased, comprehensive, and targeted domain insertion library generation technique using oligo library synthesis and multi-step Golden Gate cloning. Through benchmarking to MuA transposon-mediated library generation on four ion channel genes, we demonstrate that SPINE-generated libraries are enriched for in-frame insertions, have drastically reduced sequence bias as well as near-complete and highly-redundant coverage. Unlike transposon-mediated domain insertion that was severely biased and sparse for some genes, SPINE generated high-quality libraries for all genes tested. Using the Inward Rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir2.1, we validate the practical utility of SPINE by constructing and comparing domain insertion permissibility maps. SPINE is the first technology to enable saturated domain insertion profiling. SPINE could help explore the relationship between domain insertions and protein function, and how this relationship is shaped by evolutionary forces and can be engineered for biomedical applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institutes of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>MH109038</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000011</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Up to 80% of metazoan proteins consist of multiple protein domains (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Protein domains are independent units that retain their structure and function (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) as the &#x02018;words&#x02019; of the protein universe (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Domain recombination is an essential process in protein evolution (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Ion channels are a good example of how domain recombination helped rapidly expand functional diversity in the metazoan lineage (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels, for example, arose early in cellular life from the combination of a pore domain and a phylogenetically ancient immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), to which different allosteric ligands can bind and affect gating of the pore domain (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>In biomedical engineering, domain recombination is used to generate synthetic proteins. Many biosensors (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) are made by functionally coupling domains that sense a stimulus (e.g. ligand binding, voltage, aberrant protein activity) and domains that report these events (e.g. emitting photons, alter gene expression, induce apoptosis). Similarly, antibodies are joined end-to-end with signaling domains to create chimeric T-cell receptors for immunotherapy (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Domain recombination enables the design of programmable circuits from multi-domain proteins in living cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We recently discovered that domain insertion provides a window into protein dynamics and allostery in ion channels, and it allowed us to generate a light-switchable Inward Rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Despite the significance of domain recombination in biology and biomedical engineering, saturated domain recombination remains an unsolved problem. By saturated we mean an unbiased approach that redundantly samples all possible insertions of a donor domain into a target protein. To see why saturated approaches are necessary, we should consider that both single amino acid mutations and domain insertions can alter protein structure/function relationships. By comprehensively mapping the impact of these variations, using deep scanning mutagenesis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or differential domain insertion profiling (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we may reveal intrinsic protein properties (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>), improve our understanding of the mechanistic basis of protein function (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and guide protein engineering (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref>).</p><p>Many pioneering contributions have been made to this field but none enable saturated domain recombination. Random insertion approaches include overlap PCR (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and limited nuclease digest with non-homologous recombination (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>). However, both approaches are inefficient and endonuclease-assisted approaches result in numerous tandem duplications and deletions at insertion sites. Another approach, transposon-mediated domain insertion (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;33</xref>), is useful for probing the structure and function of proteins (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) (including ion channels (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)), generating new fluorescent proteins (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), or circularly permutating proteins (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The current state of the art is Domain Insertion Profiling through Sequencing (DIP-seq) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), which combines MuA transposase-assisted library generation with high throughput assays for linking genotype (insertion position) to a phenotype (protein folding, abundance, localization, etc.). DIP-seq has been used to engineer a ligand-sensitive Cas9 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), a light-switchable ion channel (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and transcription factors (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>Transposases, including MuA, have sequence bias (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42&#x02013;48</xref>), and create domain insertion libraries with inconsistent insertion frequencies and regions without insertions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Additionally, transposases target random DNA sequences, causing five in six insertions to be in the incorrect reading frame or wrong direction, and the MuA transposition mechanism results in an unavoidable 5 bp replication at the insertion site (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Similar to sequence coverage and depth in genomic analyses (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), insertion bias, incomplete coverage, and low redundancy of domain insertion libraries lead to sampling errors that decrease the quality of downstream functional data (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>Here, we developed a method for domain insertion called Saturated Programmable Insertion Engineering (SPINE). Unlike existing insertional mutagenesis approaches, which rely on the randomness of recombination or transposition, SPINE is a programmed method. It works by dividing a targeted gene into fragments and replacing each fragment with a microarray-synthesized oligo library (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Each oligo in this library contains a genetic handle that can be replaced with a domain of interest by Golden Gate cloning (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). SPINE overcomes many constraints of previous approaches and generates unbiased, saturated, and targeted domain insertion libraries. These improved libraries result in less missing data and improve the dynamic range of assays that measure the impact of domain insertion on target protein expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>OLS in silico design</title><p>Oligo sequences are generated using a custom algorithm (written for Python 3.7.3. and available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/schmidt-lab/SPINE">https://github.com/schmidt-lab/SPINE</ext-link>) as follows.</p><sec id="SEC2-1-1"><title>Target gene fragmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S1A</xref>)</title><p>Target gene sequences are submitted in FASTA format.

Therefore, sequential fragments overlap by one codon. Oligos consist of a bio-orthogonal barcode for specific subpool amplification, BsmBI recognition sites, and the fragment sequence with a genetic handle insertion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The genetic handle contains outward-facing BsaI restriction sites, which enable replacement of the handle with a domain of interest, and Ser&#x02013;Gly and Gly&#x02013;Ser flexible linkers at the beginning and end of the handle, respectively.

In detail, each oligo starts with a forward subpool specific barcode, appended with a forward-facing BsmBI recognition sequence plus one base to bring the cut site into frame. Next, the oligo is appended with the fragment sequence with the insertion handle inserted at the next amino acid position following the previous oligo. Finally, after the gene fragment section one base is added to bring the cut site into frame followed by a reverse facing BsmBI sequence, and a reverse subpool specific barcode.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SPINE workflow. A target gene sequence is divided into shorter fragments. For each fragment, an oligo pool is generated with a genetic handle (purple) at each amino acid position.

This process is repeated for each fragment, and the resulting intermediate libraries are pooled. The genetic handle is replaced by a domain of interest (orange) through BsaI-mediated Golden Gate cloning, resulting in the final domain insertion library. (<bold>B</bold>) Barcode Design. Each OLS subpool is designed with a bio-orthogonal barcode followed by a BsmBI recognition site that cuts within the sequence of a gene.

Each subpool contains about 170 bp of gene sequence flanked by biorthogonal barcodes for PCR amplification, and Golden Gate-compatible BsmBI sites for cloning the fragment into the target gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Varied between the oligos in each subpool is the genetic handle, which is inserted at every amino acid position of the target gene fragment corresponding to this subpool. Genetic handles are designed with Golden Gate-compatible BsaI sites at the beginnings and ends of linkers that allow replacement with any DNA sequence (in our case, a domain). The overhangs generated by these BsaI sites also encode the amino acids that serve as linkers between the target protein and the inserted domain.

This process was repeated for all fragment subpools and these libraries are combined in equimolar ratio to yield pooled intermediate libraries.

We transiently transfected insertion libraries into HEK293 cells and performed a functional assay to measure permissibility. Permissibility is the sensitivity of a channel to the insertion of a domain at a given position and is determined by measuring how well a channel variant folds, assembles, and traffics to the cell surface. All insertion variants express EGFP as a transfection marker, but only surface-expressed variants are fluorescently labeled via an extracellular FLAG tag. Using fluorescently activated cell sorting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Functional Assay), we isolate cells that express insertion variants that fold, assemble, and traffic well (EGFP high/label high), from insertion variants that do not (EGFP high/label low). We connect genotype (insertion variant) to phenotype (permissibility) by recovering and sequencing plasmids in sorted populations.</p><p>A potential problem with transient transfection is that each cell expresses a mix of insertion variants. When we sort a cell that contains a well-expressing insertion variant, sequencing will recover the coding sequence for a folding variant (the signal) and sequences that are unrelated to the phenotype (noise). Second, K<sup>+</sup> channels form tetramers which might be composed of monomers with different insertion variants; also increasing the noise. While the signal-to-noise was sufficient to conduct our work in Kir2.1 with transposon-generated insertion libraries, we wanted to establish that a surface expression assay coupled to transient transfection with diluted DNA still yields sufficient signal-to-noise in the background of SPINE libraries. As determined earlier, 60% of clones in a SPINE library have errors that stem from inefficiencies in oligo synthesis (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The predominant errors are 1 bp deletions (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65&#x02013;67</xref>). Deletions will lead to frameshift mutations and premature stop codons, which should disrupt ion channel folding, assembly, and surface trafficking. When we determined enrichment/depletion of 1 bp deletions relative to the pre-sort control, we found slight enrichment in cells expressing non-surface trafficked insertion variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S7A</xref>). Importantly, in cells with surface-trafficked insertion variants, they were depleted. Degree of enrichment and depletion appears dependent on how much library DNA was used in the transfection. Specifically, when library DNA made up only 0.5% of the total amount of transfected DNA, 1 bp deletions where enriched &#x0223c;12% in cells expressing predominantly misfolded Kir2.1, while they were depleted by &#x0223c;50% in cells expressing predominantly surface-expressed Kir2.1. With an increasing amount of library DNA, that difference grew smaller until no depletion or enrichment (in comparison to pre-sort control) was observed. We also found that despite the increased noise from increasing amounts of library DNA, permissibility assay with SPINE-generated libraries where more repeatable (0.56 SPINE versus 0.38 MuA transposase mean Spearman correlation coefficients, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figures S8 and S9</xref>).</p><p>In aggregate, these data agree with the expectation that deletions cause frameshift mutations or premature stop codons, which would cause ion channels to incorrectly fold, assemble, or traffic. Given that deletions in a cell with predominantly permissive insertion variants are depleted, suggests that even with transient transfection, our permissibility assay has sufficient signal-to-noise. The data also suggests this phenotype (surface-expression) is unlikely to be influenced by the higher mutation rate in SPINE libraries.</p><p>Having tested the sensitivity of our permissibility assay, we explored whether SPINE could improve permissibility map resolution in Kir2.1 compared to MuA transposition. With Cib81 as the inserted domain, we found SPINE improved permissibility maps. A visual inspection of permissibility data (averaged across three independent replicates) mapped onto the crystal structure of human Kir2.2 (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), visualizes the striking difference in saturation and dynamic range (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). While MuA library data is sparse with 71 sites missing and noisy, SPINE library data is almost complete (1 site is missing) and has a high dynamic range between highest and lowest permissibility. Plotting permissibility along sequence position shows that formerly missing regions are now filled in (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). For example, for a large region at the beginning of the gene (amino acid positions 1&#x02013;150) little permissibility information is available from MuA libraries (which had poor insertion coverage and depth in this region) while permissibility is measured for the entire region with SPINE libraries. In this region, there are the unstructured N terminus, several regulatory sites, and M1 transmembrane domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, protein topology cartoon) that are functionally important (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). The interface between the M1 and M2 helix is now well resolved, while most positions were missing in MuA libraries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). For all other regions, SPINE conforms to previous permissibility patterns while providing a more complete and dynamic data set. There now appear to be four levels of permissibility in Kir2.1: high permissibility for the unstructured C-terminus, moderate permissibility in the N-terminus, low permissibility in the structured cytosolic regions and no permissibility in transmembrane regions. In addition, within regions with expected high (flexible N/C termini) or no permissibility (transmembrane domain), there are fewer probable false positives or negatives (15/119 MuA versus 6/157 SPINE; two-sided <italic>z</italic> score, <italic>P</italic>-value: &#x0003c;0.0064). Further emphasizing the improved quality of permissibility maps is that insertion into a known Golgi export signal (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) have clearer negative permissibility in the SPINE data.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Domain Insertion Permissibility.

We developed SPINE as an alternative approach that uses oligo library synthesis and multi-step Golden Gate cloning to assemble domain insertion libraries in a programmable fashion. Which approach investigators choose depends on what best meets the experimental requirements; SPINE compares favorably in several aspects.</p><p>The sequence bias and variable efficiency of transposases is well established (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42&#x02013;48</xref>). We and others showed, in different protein families, that this can result in domain insertion libraries that have bias, incomplete coverage, and variable coverage redundancy (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). For all tested genes SPINE has reduced bias, near-complete coverage, and superior coverage redundancy. The success of using transposon-based domain insertion to construct, for example, biosensors (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) may suggest that transposon-based approaches work well enough. And in light of the same general trends observed in domain insertion permissibility maps for Kir2.1 in this study, one could argue that bias, lack of coverage, and depth do not matter. However, for some target genes &#x02013;such as nAChR in this study&#x02013; transposon-generated domain insertion libraries have such severe bias and marginal saturation that they are effectively unusable for applications that derive insight from comprehensive mapping of all possible domain insertions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It is hard to intuit for which target genes transposon-mediated domain insertion will perform poorly and there may be limited recourse. For example, changing codon usage, did not improve nAChR libraries (unpublished observation). In other cases, functionally important regions have no domain insertion events, such as the S4 and S5 linker in Shaker (important in mediating channel opening in response to change in voltage (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>)) and a Na<sup>+</sup> binding pocket in Kir2.1 (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). There is value in a domain insertion method that is predictable and dependable. Furthermore, lack of bias, near-complete, and redundant coverage result in richer functional data. In this study, this manifests as improved dynamic range of the Kir2.1 domain insertion permissibility signal. For other engineered proteins the case remains to be made, but we predict that SPINE will produce more complete domain insertion maps, which will increase the likelihood of finding, for example, a functional biosensor.</p><p>In the DIP-seq approach, type IIS restriction sites are embedded in the MuA transposase recognition sites to mediate the exchange of the transposon inserted into the target gene with a domain of interest with compatible flanking overhangs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The simultaneous requirements of maintaining transposition efficiency (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) and restriction efficiency puts sequence constraints on restriction enzyme recognition sequences and overhangs. Because overhang sequences are added to the original target at the insertion site and encode linkers, the amino acid composition of these linkers is constrained. Linker optimization is a critical aspect of fusion protein engineering (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). SPINE offers a significant advantage over MuA-transposon approaches because it puts no constraint on linker composition. We used a serine/glycine linker, which is used as a flexible linker (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), but any linker sequence of two amino acids at either side of the inserted domain can be used. This enables full exploration of how linker length and composition impact target protein function independent of the inserted domain. If the first and last two amino acids of the inserted domain are included as overhangs in the genetic handle, it is possible to insert a domain without any linkers. However, this would require a new OLS library for each inserted domain.</p><p>MuA can insert a transposon into any of the six reading frames, while the programmable nature of SPINE results in enriched in-frame insertions. When phenotyping assays are coupled to sequencing, as is the case for DIP-seq (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) or CPP-seq (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), SPINE allows for more efficient use of the specified sequencing output because fewer reads are spent on unproductive insertions. Furthermore, SPINE insertion libraries can be targeted to single or multiple regions of the target gene and, thus, avoid undesired insertions. Achieving the same with MuA transposases requires multiple intermediate staging libraries that contain the targeted regions, which then are subcloned with the remainder of the target gene. This feature of SPINE not only simplifies domain insertion workflows, but provide easier access to complex domain insertion library designs. In Kir2.1 for example, targeting domain insertions to known allosteric sites in Kir2.1 while avoiding transmembrane region or trafficking signals could be a promising strategy to efficiently construct light- and drug-switchable versions of this ion channel.</p><p>SPINE relies on microchip-synthesized oligonucleotides which have an overall error rate of &#x0223c;0.2% (1 in 500 bp) (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). This means that only &#x0223c;50% of the oligos in a 230 bp OLS pool are expected to have the correct sequence. Since we do not (but could in the future) use enzymatic error-correction (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>), the number of assembled domain insertion variants carrying mutations is high (&#x0223c;60% in this study). Owing to inefficiencies in the phosphoramidite chemistry used in oligo library synthesis, the predominant error is single-base deletions (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65&#x02013;67</xref>) (36% in this study). Single-base deletions result in frameshift mutations that introduce premature stop codons and therefore non-functional proteins. Our data supports this by showing that single-base deletions are strongly depleted in cells expressing surface-expressed protein. Missense mutations are rare (1&#x02013;8% in this study) and considering the large number if possible combinations of missense mutations and domain insert sites (&#x0003e;2 million for Kir2.1) it is unlikely that the same missense mutation occurs frequently enough with the same domain insertion to influence the observed phenotype. Overall, the majority of mutations introduced by SPINE do not substantially impact downstream assay fidelity. Lastly, new chemistries and processes continuously improve oligo synthesis sequence fidelity, which can benefit SPINE in the future.</p><p>Transposon-based approaches and SPINE both operate at the nucleic acid level and can be applied to arbitrary protein coding and non-coding sequences. Some domestication is required with SPINE in the form of removing certain type IIS restriction sites (here, BsaI and BsmBI), however, in the age of relatively cheap DNA synthesis this a low barrier. While the same OLS pool can be reused to insert different domains into the same target (protein) sequence, each additional target requires a new pool. In light of these requirements, transposon-based domain insertion library construction holds a measurable cost and ease-of-use advantage, in particular, if the number of targeted proteins in large and the number of inserted domains is small. For applications that require drastically reduced bias, complete coverage, and more redundancy these advantages may be less relevant. Under such circumstances, SPINE offers distinct cost and time advantages as an approach that will likely work on the first try.</p><p>SPINE is to our knowledge the first method to enable saturated domain insertion profiling. This puts domain insertion profiling on the same level as deep mutagenesis as a method that enables experimental evolution. Like mutations, domain insertion is a major source of genetic variation that underlies natural evolution. By virtue of the programmable nature of OLS, other types of genetic variation can conceivably be combined with domain insertion, including any combination of single amino acid mutations, insertions, or deletions. This opens up the possibility to study how the effects of domain insertion depend on sequence context, i.e. epistasis (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Saturated domain insertion profiling, made possible by SPINE, can be a window into the relationship between domain insertion and the emergence of new protein function and how this relationship is shaped by other evolutionary forces.</p><p>From a practical perspective, SPINE could also prove instrumental in protein engineering. Rational approaches explicitly leverage structural and functional information (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>), however in the absence of such information, they reach their limits. Computational approaches (e.g. coevolution analysis (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>)) work best in large protein families with wide-spread and homogeneously distributed similarity. Rule-based <italic>de novo</italic> protein design (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>) is rapidly advancing, but does not capture protein dynamics that underlie allosteric transitions (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Domain insertion profiling is a scalable method that can provide a window into protein evolution, dynamics and allostery. For example, we used this approach to identify sites with engineerable allostery in the Inward Rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir2.1, and inserting a light-switchable domain into these sites rendered Kir2.1 activity sensitive to light (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Perhaps other channel-based opto- and chemogenetic reagents can be constructed in a similar manner. The SPINE-generated insertion library can be used with different downstream genotype-phenotype assays other than measuring surface expression, including measuring abundance as a proxy for protein stability (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) or enzyme activity coupled to cell survival (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This makes SPINE a broadly useful insertional mutagenesis technique that offers the opportunity to generate large-scale domain insertion datasets to exhaustively explore the critical parameters that contribute to the construction of synthetic fusion proteins, such as, the location of the insertion, linker length, and linker composition. Empirical rules for protein engineering derived from SPINE-generated datasets may be useful to improve algorithms used in rationale, computational, and rule-based approaches.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>CODE AVAILABILITY</title><p>The code for handling data from domain insertion library sequencing is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/SavageLab/dipseq">https://github.com/SavageLab/dipseq</ext-link>.
