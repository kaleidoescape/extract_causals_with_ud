However, there is only one documented case of a basic-helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix leucine zipper transcription factor&#x02014;microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)&#x02014;in which an insertion of a three-residue stammer serves as a determinant of conditional partner selectivity. To unravel the molecular principles of this selectivity, we have analyzed the high-resolution structures of stammer-containing MITF and an engineered stammer-less MITF variant, which comprises an uninterrupted symmetric coiled coil. Despite this fundamental difference, both MITF structures reveal identical flanking in-phase coiled coil arrangements, gained by helical over-winding and local asymmetry in wild-type MITF across the stammer region. These conserved structural properties allow the maintenance of a proper functional readout in terms of nuclear localization and binding to specific DNA-response motifs regardless of the presence of the stammer. By contrast, MITF heterodimer formation with other bHLH-Zip transcription factors is only permissive when both factors contain either the same type of inserted stammer or no insert. Our data illustrate a unique principle of conditional partner selectivity within the wide arsenal of transcription factors with specific partner-dependent functional readouts.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Icelandic Research Fund</named-content></funding-source><award-id>163413</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Austrian Science Fund</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100002428</named-content></funding-source><award-id>FWF P28701</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Protein sequences that induce extended &#x003b1;-helical coiled coil arrangements represent one of the most frequently occurring structural motifs in the protein fold universe, covering &#x0223c;10% of the proteomes from various organisms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Perhaps the most prominent functional role of helical coiled coils is to act as molecular spacers and rulers with atom-level precision (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). They critically contribute to defining and controlling precise dimensions in biological processes such as vesicle tethering, chromosome segregation, the architecture of the centriole and DNA recognition and cleavage.</p><p>At the molecular level, helical coiled coils assemble in a range of two up to six helices that can be either parallel or antiparallel (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Coiled coils can originate from identical or different sequences, leading to either protein/protein homo- or hetero-oligomerization, respectively. There are three widespread classes of coiled coil assembled transcription factors: the simplest category is represented by basic leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors, in which one long chopstick-type of dimeric helix arrangement serves as both dimerization and DNA-binding module (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In the two other categories, leucine zippers (Zip) are combined either with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domains, which form a second distinct dimerization site, or&#x02014;in plants only&#x02014;with homeodomains (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>). Transcription factors with bHLH domains are also found in combination with PAS domains or with the less-characterized Orange domains (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In previous work on the bZip transcription factors MafB and c-Fos, we have shown how preferences for homo- and hetero-dimerization can be determined by single-residue mutations within a given set of coiled coil heptad interactions (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This and various other studies have also demonstrated how coiled coil arrangements can be modularly combined with other unrelated structural motifs that define additional permissible protein/protein interactions and protein/DNA-binding interactions, further increasing combinatorial complexity for various distinct functional readouts in transcriptional profiles of multi-protein component complexes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>Within the family of bHLH-Zip transcription factors, which contains about a dozen distinct members identified in higher vertebrates (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), there is a small sub-group known as the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)/TFE family with four closely related members&#x02014;MITF, TFEB, TFE3 and TFEC. By contrast, in lower organisms such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> only one single MITF/TFE orthologue is found, suggesting a common evolutionary origin (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Members of this family are global regulators of cell survival and energy metabolism by promoting expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes, with targets that are involved in oxidative metabolism and oxidative stress response (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>). MITF/TFE-type transcription factors share the ability with other bHLH-Zip transcription factors to bind DNA-recognition elements such as the E-, M- and CLEAR-boxes, with the respective consensus sequences GCACGTGC, TCATGTGC and TCACGTGA. The palindromic E- and CLEAR-boxes differ at the base pair flanking the CACGTG core motif whereas the related M-box presents an asymmetric sequence pattern. Nevertheless, according to available data, their dimerization ability is restricted to members of the MITF/TFE family (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Previous work from our group revealed that the coiled coil leucine zipper in MITF is structurally interrupted by a three-residue insert (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Systematic studies of known coiled coil protein structures led to the classification of such inserts as &#x02018;stammers&#x02019; generating a &#x02212;51&#x000b0;&#x000a0;helical phase change that is generally compensated by neighboring residues to allow continuation of a regular coiled coil (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Stammer-containing coiled coil proteins are one of the rarest categories of proteins with perturbed coiled coils (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), suggesting that conservation of a stammer at a well-defined coiled coil position within all members of the MITF/TFE family is due to functional reasons. To the best of our knowledge, the stammer insert of the coiled coil segments in members of the MITF/TFE family represents the only established example where this insert determines permissive assembly with other bHLH-Zip transcription factors.</p><p>To unravel the underlying principles of conditional partnering, we determined the high-resolution structure of a stammer-less MITF variant, in addition to the already known structure of the MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) dimer (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The coiled coil segment of the stammer-less MITF structure is continuous and without any asymmetry. Comparison of the two structures reveals how the stammer in MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) is accommodated by over-winding and local asymmetry to allow an identical arrangement of the flanking regions while maintaining key functional properties such as the ability for nuclear localization and binding of specific DNA-response motifs. We show several lines of evidence, supported by our structural findings, that only in-phase heterodimerization with other bHLH-Zip transcription factors, both of which either contain a stammer or no insert, is permissive. Our data add a new mechanism to the combinatorial arsenal of transcription factor partnering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Protein expression, purification and biophysical characterization</title><p>Two fragments from the <italic>Mus musculus MITF</italic> cDNA (residues 217&#x02013;296 and 180&#x02013;296) were mutated to remove residues 259&#x02013;261 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, colored in red) with the Quickchange protocol (Agilent) and purified as described (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

We found three non-redundant clusters (&#x0003c;90% sequence identity) of homodimeric and three clusters of heterodimeric bHLH-Zip transcription factor pairs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In contrast to our searches for self-identification of different MITF variants, the level of sequence identity between MITF and the other bHLH-Zip transcription factors is too low for confirming correctness of the coiled coil segment alignment. Therefore, validation of the alignments has been limited to the identification of potential coiled coil sequence abnormalities such as the stammer in MITF<italic>(wt)</italic> and established heptad sequence patterns that are, however, only partly conserved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Interestingly, all detected homo- and heterodimers of bHLH-Zip transcription factors other than MITF are formed by structures with uninterrupted stammer-less coiled coil segments. Hence, the heptad periodicity is maintained in the respective structure-based sequence alignments only when using MITF(&#x00394;) as the structural template whereas the use of MITF<italic>(wt)</italic> structure leads to out-of-register sequence alignments, reminiscent of the MITF(&#x00394;)/MITF<italic>(wt)</italic> alignment. We therefore used the MITF(&#x00394;) structure as the template for all illustrated superimpositions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The level of sequence identity between these targets and MITF is between 15 and 37%, whereas the structural diversity is only slightly higher than superimposed MITF structural pairs with identical sequences (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The data thus show that the conformational plasticity that is inherent in coiled coil structures competes with or even overrules the structural diversity due to sequence diversity when using MITF as the template. We also noted that apart from both homo- and heterodimeric assemblies of MAX and MYC, the extent of superimposed heptad repeats with the coiled coil region is substantially reduced. For the heterodimeric bHLH-Zip transcription factor pairs SCI/E47 and CLOCK/BMAL1A, the superposition is limited to the first two heptad repeats, which are separated by the stammer in MITF<italic>(wt)</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We conclude that, as we were able to detect the same distantly related bHLH-Zip transcription factor pairs with three different MITF coordinate sets (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), the search presented here is likely to cover all detectable bHLH-Zip transcription factor pairs whose molecular structures have been determined to date.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Search for related bHLH-Zip transcription factors using MITF(&#x00394;) as the template.

In both structures, it is mainly driven by knobs-into-holes packing for heptad positions a/a&#x02019; and d/d&#x02019; of all five coiled coil heptads 0 and I&#x02013;IV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>). In contrast to the MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) segmented coiled coil where we observed a hole in the dimeric interface next to the stammer insert (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the arrangement of the coiled coil interface in MITF(&#x00394;) is tight and without any major cavities or holes.</p><p>In both MITF structures, the Zip helices are connected by specific interactions over the entire coiled coil segment. As expected, the most significant conformational changes are observed in heptad 1, which is symmetric and tightly packed in the MITF(&#x00394;) dimer and thus allows the formation of a new two-fold repeated salt bridge between Arg263 and Glu268 from both MITF(&#x00394;) polypeptide chains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These interactions are not possible in the MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) structure, as the two residues are too far apart from each other to allow a specific interaction due to the asymmetry induced by the stammer (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Changes in the overall arrangement caused by the stammer are extended into heptad 2, where different residue pairs are involved in specific interactions, whereas in heptads 3&#x02013;5 only minor changes are observed. The initial coiled coil segment (heptad 0) between the HLH motif and the stammer segment is virtually identical in both structures, indicating that the main effect by the presence/absence of the stammer is propagated towards the C-terminal leucine zipper arrangement.</p><p>Comparison of the geometrical parameters used for the characterization of coiled coil structures demonstrates that removal of the stammer insert in the MITF(&#x00394;) structure relieves the requirement of compensating for the expected &#x02212;51&#x000b0; coiled coil phase shift, which is equivalent to an Insertion Index change I<sub>A</sub> of &#x02212;0.5 according to a recent systematic analysis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In the structure of MITF(<italic>wt</italic>), a phase shift compensation is achieved by a change in Accommodation Index of &#x02212;0.5 over a residue range of about 20 residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). The structural irregularity induced by the stammer in MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) is also reflected by a peak in local structural asymmetry exceeding 0.5 &#x000c5; r.m.s.d. within the coiled coil next to the stammer, whereas there is no significant asymmetry in the MITF(&#x00394;) structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Other geometric parameters such as coiled coil periodicity, radius, and axis curvature, also reveal substantial deviations for the stammer insert region in MITF(<italic>wt</italic>), which are not observed in the stammer-less MITF(&#x00394;) structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>MITF has a modular functional domain arrangement</title><p>We next investigated whether MITF(&#x00394;) retains the ability for nuclear localization and DNA binding. Composite structural models combining the structure of MITF(&#x00394;) and previous structures of MITF(<italic>wt</italic>)&#x02013;DNA complexes suggest a modular organization of the MITF region including the Basic Region (BR) and Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) domain, which provide the DNA-binding properties of the protein, and the C-terminal coiled coil segment, which contains the region involved in homo- or heterodimerization with other bHLH-Zip transcription factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). As measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), MITF(&#x00394;) binds to DNA containing the specific E-box and M-box response motifs with dissociation constants of about 10 nM, which corresponds to a slightly lower affinity than those measured for MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>, Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The binding stoichiometry remains 2:1 in all measurements, representing the interactions of one MITF dimer with one DNA duplex.

As the structures of the BR and HLH regions of both MITF variants are virtually identical (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>,B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), the most plausible explanation for this difference points to the increased thermal stability of the MITF(&#x00394;) structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Thermal stabilization is generally caused by a rigidified structural arrangement (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) that may reduce the amount of structural flexibility required to generate several specific interactions to allow optimum DNA binding (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42&#x02013;44</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Specific DNA-binding properties of MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) and MITF(&#x00394;).

Since the stammer insert in MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) is located within the third segment, we looked for specific structural differences within this segment in the respective MITF(wt) and MITF(&#x00394;) structures. Whereas most of the positively charged residues within this segment (Arg255, Lys256, Arg263, Lys265) are exposed in both structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), Arg259 is part of the triple residue deletion in MITF(&#x00394;) and therefore absent in the respective structure. Confocal imaging revealed, however, that nuclear localization is not altered in the MITF(&#x00394;) variant in HEK293T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), suggesting that a possible contribution of the stammer residue Arg259 to nuclear localization is dispensable.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>The MITF stammer determines coiled coil protein partner specificity</title><p>To determine whether staggering of heptad repeats induced by the MITF stammer insert provides a basis of exclusive selectivity of coiled coil protein partners with a strict requirement of in-phase heptad repeats, we used several bHLH-Zip transcription factors that are either in phase with stammer-inserted MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) or with the stammer-removed MITF(&#x00394;) variant.

For MITF(<italic>wt</italic>)/TFEB we created two closely related alternative models using the structure of the asymmetric MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) homodimer, either by replacing MITF chain A or MITF chain B by TFEB (only one is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The MITF/MAX heterodimer was created using the structure of the MITF(&#x00394;) homodimer. Since this template is highly symmetric, replacement of MITF(&#x00394;) chains A or B by MAX led to virtually identical models.</p><p>When comparing the structural models, we observed three structurally conserved coiled coil hydrogen bond interactions in heptads 0, 3 and 4 in all four structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">D</xref>, solid lines with filled arrow heads).

The MITF heptad-4 g-e&#x02019;/g&#x02019;-e Arg284&#x02013;Glu289 interaction is also conserved across all four structural models. Both equivalent residues are identical in the TFEB sequence. In MAX, only the residue equivalent to MITF Glu289 is identical (Glu103), whereas the equivalent of MITF Arg284 is a glutamine (Gln98). Finally, there is an invariant heptad-3 a-a&#x02019;/a&#x02019;-a interaction in all four structures that is formed by Asn278&#x02013;Asn278&#x02032; pair from both chains in MITF.

Within this framework, it was well established that a three-residue insert, also termed a &#x02018;stammer&#x02019;, leads to a decrease of superhelical periodicity compensated by helical overwinding. However, only a small number of protein structures containing an asymmetric stammer inserted coiled coil have been described to date. Known and well-characterized examples are the stammer inserts in PAN3 pseudokinase (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and in the cyclin T binding domain of hexim (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), which are both essential for binding to cognate protein ligands. A stammer-less hexim variant interacts with 7SK snRNA in the same way as <italic>wt</italic> hexim (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p><p>The TFE family, including MITF and TFEB, provide the only reported evidence for stammer-dependent heterodimeric partner selection mediated by coiled coil interactions (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Although the stammer motif itself is partly conserved in the different members of the TFE family (&#x02018;KEQ&#x02019; in TFEC and TFE3, &#x02018;KDL&#x02019; in TFEB), previous data using a MITF variant in which three consecutive stammer residues were mutated into alanine showed no detectable effect altering the ability for selective homo/hetero-dimerization (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The findings led to the conclusion that the observed sequence conservation is probably due to close evolutionary relations of different members of the TFE family rather than functional constraints.</p><p>Here, we show that both MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) and stammer-less MITF(&#x00394;) retained their ability to bind DNA, suggesting that the sequence regions flanking the coiled coil segments are functionally autonomous, regardless of the presence of a stammer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>,&#x000a0;B). By contrast, heterodimeric out-of-phase interactions by a stammer-less and a stammer-containing partner are not permissive in the context of additional folding regions such as the BR and HLH segments in MITF that require an in-phase dimeric arrangement to be functional (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This model permits interactions of stammer-containing non-canonical and stammer-less, canonical bHLH-Zip transcription factors, as long as other heptad positions&#x02014;in particular positions a, e and g&#x02014;allow favorable interactions. By contrast, formation of pairs from stammer-containing and stammer-less bHLH-Zip transcription factors is, according to our findings, not permissive. Interestingly, this rule can be overcome in the absence of those regions, as shown for a truncated version of MITF containing only the coiled coil segment (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In that study, using a selection screen focused on the MITF coiled coil as target, a synthetic helix sequence (iM10) without a stammer insert was enriched with a stammer-containing MITF coiled coil segment in a symmetric canonical arrangement (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Similar to the substantial thermal stabilization by 18&#x000b0;C we found for the MITF(&#x00394;) variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), the melting temperature of the MITF/iM10 coiled coil was remarkably increased by 25&#x000b0;C when compared to the homodimeric MITF(<italic>wt</italic>) coiled coil. These findings confirm previous data demonstrating that a regular coiled coil pattern found in canonical, non-interrupted coiled coils substantially contributes to overall thermal stability and is therefore thermodynamically preferred in the absence of additional flanking dimerization modules such as the bHLH domain in MITF (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p><p>Ultimately, the precise readout of gene transcription relies on highly combinatorial interactions of multiple transcription factors and regulators prior to and during DNA binding, which also depends on DNA accessibility (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Despite the inspiring early studies on the mechanism of heterodimerization of the two coiled coil transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), further structural studies to determine molecular rules by which homodimeric and heterodimeric coiled coil assemblies are discriminated have remained sparse. Of these, we have previously directly compared the structures of homodimeric MafB<sub>2</sub> and heterodimeric MafB/c-Fos complexes to demonstrate how DNA recognition motif binding preferences change (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>For the specific family of bHLH-Zip transcription factors, at present structures are only available for a few heterodimeric assemblies, all of which form uninterrupted coiled coils (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). These structures provide insights into how multiple partnerships with different functional readouts are possible, provided the respective participating sequences permit attractive interactions specifically in heptad positions a-a&#x02019;/a&#x02019;-a and g-e&#x02019;/g&#x02019;-e. Here we show that the presence of a stammer insert, as found within the coiled coils of the members of the MITF/TFE family, does not permit partnering with canonical bHLH-Zip transcription factors such as MAX, MAD and MYC, despite the presence of favorable coiled coil interactions C-terminal to the stammer. If we suppose that a shift of register would be possible, it would inevitably lead to dysfunctional neighboring modules including the DNA-binding domain, thus requiring proper dimerization architecture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Whether this rule is less strict for non-permissive partnering with bHLH-Zip transcription factors with shorter coiled coil segments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) remains an open question at this point. Interestingly, heterodimeric partnering with a bZip transcription factor lacking the HLH motif has not been reported for any bHLH-Zip transcription factor, presumably due to a strict requirement for a dimeric arrangement of the HLH module (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p><p>Although many different mutations have been found in the MITF gene in mice, humans and other species, none affect the stammer sequence (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58&#x02013;60</xref>). We would expect such a mutation to exhibit severe effects on the phenotype, leading to microphthalmia and absence of melanocytes, since the protein would not be able to form homodimers or heterodimers with the TFE family.</p><p>Ultimately, our findings generate crucial questions for future research in the field. Searches for coiled coil structures with alternative modes for changing heptad register such as skips and stutters, equivalent to 1-residue and 4-residue insertions, in addition to stammers (three-residue insertion) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) could provide new insight into how widespread restricted coiled coil heterodimerization may occur. It would also be revealing to investigate at which stage heterodimerization takes place under physiological conditions, whether at the level of ribosomal biosynthesis or by as yet uncharacterized disassembly/reassembly events post ribosomal biosynthesis. Finally, our data open up attractive possibilities in the rewiring of combinatorial interactions and functional readouts of different bHLH-Zip transcription factors by inserting or removing coiled coil phase interrupting sequence elements to design new circuits at a transcriptional level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The atomic coordinates and structure factors of MITF(&#x00394;) have been deposited in the PDB with accession code 6FX5.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1104_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz1104_supplemental_file.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank the staff of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility for assistance and support in using beamline ID23-2.
