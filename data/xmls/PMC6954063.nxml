Inspired by these natural examples, a variety of artificial structural color materials with film, fiber, or particle morphologies have been developed for different applications by using various methods, including etching, printing, self-assembling, etc. (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). In particular, since droplet microfluidics was used as microreactors, the development of spherical structural color materials has found exciting avenues (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>). This new strategy not only ensures the monodispersity but also increases the componential and morphological diversity of the structural color particles (SCPs). Besides benefiting from their spherical symmetry, the photonic bandgaps (PBGs) of the resultant microfluidic SCPs are usually independent of rotation under illumination at a fixed incident angle, which broadens the perspective values of the structural color materials for displaying, coding, sensing, and so on (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). However, despite the substantial progress that has been made in SCPs, their main applications are still limited to the isotropic morphologies and photonic nanostructures, since most of the self-assembly approaches in droplet microreactors can only achieve spherical particles, which are difficult for controllable fixation, location, and orientation. In addition, because of the relatively low refractive index contrast among their components, which causes apparent light transmission and reduced reflection, most of the SCPs are suffering from dim and undistinguishable structural colors in practical applications. Thus, the creation of novel SCPs with distinctive functions is still anticipated.</p><p>In this paper, we present a strategy for the formation of the desired anisotropic SCPs by phase separation of graphene oxide (GO) and silica nanoparticles in droplets, as schemed in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. Graphene and its derivatives, as emerging multifunctional materials, have been investigated extensively in different areas because of their extraordinary electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). However, these graphene materials have seldom been integrated into structural color systems, and their effects in the self-assembly of colloid droplets is still undiscovered. Thus, we herein explored this research by coassembling GO and colloid nanoparticles in droplets and observed an interesting phase separation phenomenon of their components because of the synergistic effect of charge and density. On the basis of this phenomenon, anisotropic Janus SCPs with hemispherical colloidal crystal cluster and oblate GO component could be achieved by evaporating the water in the droplets. Because of their specific morphology and components, these anisotropic SCPs, as well as their inverse opal hydrogel derivatives (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), were imparted with brilliant structural colors and controllable capabilities of fixation, location, orientation, and even responsiveness. These features indicated that the anisotropic hydrogel SCPs were ideal candidates for dynamic cell monitoring and sensing (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We believe that these anisotropic SCPs may also appeal to applications in many other fields.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Schematic diagrams of the generation process and cardiomyocyte monitoring of the anisotropic Janus SCPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Generation process of the anisotropic Janus SCPs.

The droplet templates generated from the microfluidic device were collected in a hydrophobic container with silicon oil and heated by a heater for solvent evaporation and particle drying, as shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. During the drying process, the droplet templates were sectioned into two layers gradually: The top layer was mainly composed of GO, and the bottom layer was the deposition of silica nanoparticles. Then, the GO and nanoparticles further concentrated along with time so that the top layer showed a blacker color because of the enrichment of GO, and the bottom layer exhibited vivid structural color due to the self-assembly of silica nanoparticles. Last, the particles derived from the template droplets exhibited a special Janus structure, i.e., the black oblate &#x0201c;dark section&#x0201d; and the colorful hemispherical &#x0201c;photonic section.&#x0201d;</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>The phase separation phenomenon of GO and silica nanoparticles in a droplet during the heating process.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> to <bold>I</bold>) The optical images of a droplet at different time during the heating process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aay1438-F2"/></fig><p>In many previous studies, additives could mix with nanoparticles relatively homogeneously (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Since the GO has a sheet structure, the homogeneous mix with silica nanoparticles was thought to result in an amorphous structure (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). However, in this study, the droplet templates demonstrated phase separation behavior and Janus structure beyond expectation. This phenomenon could be ascribed to the following three reasons: ions (pH), density, and assembly time. First, the ions of the GO solution affected the stability of the silica nanoparticles in water. As the silica nanoparticles used in this study were prepared by the hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane, there were many Si-OH groups on the surface of the nanoparticles that could ionize in the solution; hence, the nanoparticles exhibited negative charge and were mutually exclusive, and their total interparticle potential in the solution was comparatively balanced. On the contrary, when some ions or acids were added into the solution, the absolute value of the zeta potential of the nanoparticles would notably reduce, which meant the repulsion among the nanoparticles was weakened and the balance was broken, so that the nanoparticles tended to deposit (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>). Therefore, the addition of the GO (pH 1.88) would suppress the ionization of the silica nanoparticles, which resulted in a reduced charge and lower repulsive force of the nanoparticles and, thus, caused the break of the stable state and the deposition of the nanoparticles (fig. S1 and table S1). As the diameters of the nanoparticles in the mixed solution calculated by the Stokes&#x02019; law (360 nm) and measured by the granulometer (about 298 nm) were all close to the original value before mixing with GO [about 250 nm from scanning electron microscope and 287 nm from granulometer], there was little aggregation in the mixed solution (the specific calculation process of the size of the nanoparticles through the Stokes&#x02019; law is presented in the Supplementary Materials). We also prepared and observed the colloidal array formed at the similar pH condition without GO by adding acid solution. It was found that the assembled particles could form a uniform spherical structure, but the arrangement of the nanoparticles observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was disordered (fig. S2, A and B). This result might be ascribed to the introduced acid radical ions in the pH tuning process. To confirm this deduction, we assembled sulfonic-group-modified nanoparticles in droplets (pH 1.74) to avoid the interference of other ions and observed their resultant microstructures by SEM. It was observed that the surface and interior of the assembled particles were all with ordered hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) microstructures (fig. S2, C and D). Next, the silica nanoparticles had greater densities than the GO; its layer would settle at the bottom of the resultant Janus particles. As a result, the low-density GO would concentrate in the upside and thereby form a two-layer structure. The last reason is that the phase separation process is relatively time-consuming; many methods like spray coating can be completed in a short time, and therefore, the Janus structure could not be finished and observed through these protocols.</p><p>The crystallization of the colloidal array was attributed to the solvent evaporation. In this case, the loss of solvent would squeeze the silica nanoparticles in the droplets, and then the nanoparticles would self-assemble into an HCP structure according to the lowest energy principle. The GO could be reduced at 70&#x000b0;C depending on the addition of a reducing agent. However, in our study, we did not used a reducing agent with GO, so the GO could not be reduced during the drying process. During the droplet shrinkage, the GO would aggregate and eventually dry together because of the solvent evaporation. Thus, after the solvent totally evaporated, the Janus particles with the GO-enriched top section and the silica nanoparticle crystalline bottom section could be obtained. Then, these Janus particles were then calcined under the protection of argon to acquire a higher mechanical strength, and the GO was lastly transformed into reduced GO (rGO) with darker colors. The microstructure of the resultant anisotropic SCPs was characterized by SEM. As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, the anisotropic SCP was composed of a hemispherical section and an oblate part. With higher magnification, the silica nanoparticles self-assembled into an ordered HCP structure, which could be observed on the surface and the interior of the hemisphere (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). The oblate part of the anisotropic SCP was also observed in detail, as demonstrated in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and fig. S2 (E and F); it was apparent that there was abundant GO that enriched and disordered the arrangement of silica nanoparticles in the oblate part. It is worth mentioning that there were some GO sheets that existed in the interstitial voids of the colloidal array. Actually, in most areas of the silica nanoparticle layer that is not in contact with the GO layer, the nanoparticles were not affected by the GO and thus could self-assemble into an HCP structure. However, these nanoparticles, which were close to the interface between the two layers, showed a relatively disordered microstructure because of the incomplete separation of the mixture at the unsmooth interface (fig. S3, A to C).</p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>The SEM images of an anisotropic SCP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole view of the anisotropic Janus SCP.

In general, the <italic>n</italic><sub>average</sub> of the photonic section composed of the same components is constant; hence, the colors of the anisotropic SCPs could be tailored by changing the diameters of the self-assembling nanoparticles, as shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> (A to C and F). Meanwhile, because of the disordering and the broadband light absorption of the GO, the dark section showed a black view, which definitely helped to improve the color contrast and saturation of the photonic section and reduce the full width at half maximum (FWHM) so that the clearer structural color could be observed in this section (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>The optic and morphology characterization of the Janus SCPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> to <bold>C</bold>) Reflection microscope images of three kinds of anisotropic Janus SCPs.

In general, the faster outer flow rate or slower inner flow rate would result in smaller anisotropic SCPs (fig. S4). The effects of different amounts of mixed GO were also discussed. As illustrated in fig. S5, the diameter of the particles would enlarge with the increasing GO amount when the concentration of GO in the mixture was less than 3 mg/ml, while the particle size would remain invariable if the GO concentration was higher than that threshold. Besides, the mixed GO could regulate the morphology of the anisotropic SCPs. In general, the water droplets in silicon oil are kept spherical because of the surface tension. Thus, the silica nanoparticle&#x02013;dispersed droplets without GO were kept spherical during the drying process (fig. S2A). In comparison, the silica nanoparticle&#x02013;dispersed droplets with GO additives were separated into two layers in the silicon oil, and both the two layers tended to form the hemispherical shape. When the GO was with high concentration, the GO layer formed the hemispherical shape. However, if the GO could not reach that high concentration, then the resulting GO layer would have a small volume and thus will be thinner than the nanoparticle layer because the interface between the two layers is consistent. Therefore, the GO layer had a larger radius of curvature than the nanoparticle layer and showed a flat shape (fig. S6). For better description, we defined the thickness of the dark section as the minor axis and the diameter of the particle as the major axis (fig. S3A). Different from the major axis, the length of the minor axis was closely related to the GO concentration notably during the whole concentration range, and hence, the ratio of the minor axis to the major axis increased along with the increase in concentration of GO (fig. S3D). Moreover, it is worth noting that although the GO affected the self-assembling of silica nanoparticles in the dark section, it had little influence on the silica nanoparticles in photonic section even with high concentration (fig. S6). Thus, the reflective spectra of the anisotropic SCPs with different concentrations of GO had the same peak positions, while the intensity would reduce slightly along with the increase in GO because of the smaller photonic section and the enhanced light absorption (fig. S7A). In addition, on account of the three-dimensional hemispherical structure, the ordered photonic section of the anisotropic SCPs was endowed with an angle independence similar to the common spherical particles. It is worth noting that the Janus particles in fig. S8A exhibited a bit of red color. However, although there was little color to be observed, its reflective spectrum was much lower than of others, and thus, it seemed that the dark section had no reflective peak (fig. S7B).</p><p>The Janus structure often provides materials more functions than the homogeneous structure (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>). In this study, the unique Janus morphology of our designed particles not only led to a distinct optical characteristics but also imparted them the capabilities of fixation, location, and orientation. As a demonstration, the anisotropic SCPs and the spherical SCPs were put in the same kind of microfluidic channels, respectively. With a flow rate, the spherical SCPs rolled away easily. However, when the Janus SCPs suffered from fluid shock, the ones with the photonic section in contact with the channel wall would roll along with the fluid until they turned over and the dark section began to be in contact with the wall; meanwhile, the ones with the dark section in contact with the channel wall initially would only move a little distance (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> and movies S1 and S2). These could be attributed to the specific plane structure of the oblate section, which provided higher sliding friction force and shock resistance compared with the common spherical SCPs, so that the anisotropic SCPs easily remained still on the flow. Thus, this kind of anisotropic SCPs with a previously unreported macroscopically fixable feature would have broader application prospects compared with those traditional structural color materials.</p><p>To explore the intelligent responsive capacity of the Janus particles, we used them as templates for constructing responsive structural color hydrogel particles, as illustrated in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>. Specifically, we chose <italic>N</italic>-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as monomer and <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-methylenebis(acrylamide) (Bis) as cross-linker in the preparation of thermal responsive particles. During the process, the pregel solution contained NIPAM, and Bis was introduced into the anisotropic SCPs and filled the voids among the nanoparticles and rGO first. After being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, the solution was polymerized, silica/rGO&#x02013;pNIPAM [poly(NIPAM)] hybrid particles were obtained, and the porous rGO-pNIPAM anisotropic hydrogel SCPs were finally acquired after hydrofluoric acid etching. The hybrid and anisotropic hydrogel SCPs also showed vivid colors (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and figs. S8, A and B, and S9), which indicated that they inherited the rGO and ordered structure of the templates, and this deduction was further confirmed by the SEM images (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C to E</xref>, and fig. S8, C and D). On this basis, to demonstrate the dynamic regulation capability of the anisotropic hydrogel SCPs, we used a parallel near-infrared (NIR) light to trigger the particles. It has been widely confirmed that rGO has a photothermal effect because of its strong NIR absorption, and pNIPAM can reversibly shrink and swell due to the temperature change cycle. The anisotropic hydrogel SCPs combined the two features; thus, they were expected to exhibit photothermally responsive performance. As shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>, figs. S10 and S11A, and movie S3, when the hydrogel particles were exposed in the NIR light, they shrank immediately and demonstrated a distinct color change. It was found that the light intensity of the NIR could also affect the degree of the volume change. The higher the light intensity was, the larger and faster the volume and reflective peaks changed (fig. S11B). These results indicated that the pNIPAM anisotropic hydrogel SCPs have the potential to be used as photothermal switches or NIR-triggered system due to their photothermal conversion capability.</p><fig id="F5" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>The microstructures and photothermal responsiveness of NIPAM hydrogel Janus SCPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the responsiveness principle of photothermal responsive hydrogel Janus SCPs.

As a kind of derivation of modified extracellular matrix components, GelMA has superb biocompatibility, and thus, the GelMA anisotropic hydrogel SCPs were suitable for cell culture (fig. S12) (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>). Similar to the pNIPAM anisotropic hydrogel SCPs, the resultant GelMA anisotropic hydrogel SCPs could also exhibit vivid colors (fig. S13, A to C). As the refractive index of GelMA is higher than that of water, the reflective peaks of the hybrid particles showed a red shift. After the silica was replaced by water, the average refractive index decreased; thus, the reflective peaks of the anisotropic hydrogel SCPs shifted notably to the blue side (fig. S13D).</p><p>Here, we used the GelMA anisotropic hydrogel SCPs as microcarriers for the culture and monitoring of the cardiomyocytes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). To implement this concept, the cardiomyocytes were extracted from rats and cultured for 2 days to recover stable autonomic beating. A confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) was used to investigate the growth conditions of the cultured cells. As shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, the cardiomyocytes spread out on the surface of an anisotropic hydrogel SCP and showed the obvious structure of a sarcomere. This indicated that the cellular morphology of the cardiomyocytes was recovered. The cell activity was another important index to characterize the growth condition of cells. In most cases, the activities of cells were measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) or cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), which are reagent dependent, time-consuming, and multistep. Although some mechanical sensors had been studied for detecting cardiomyocyte activities, the precision-machined and complicated devices made them difficult to apply (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><italic>44</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>). Here, the GelMA anisotropic hydrogel SCPs could not only culture the cardiomyocytes but also monitor the cell activities by observing the structural colors. Because the beating of the cardiomyocytes (about 20 cells) caused the shrinkage of particles during the contracting process and the return to the original shape during the relaxing process, the structural color of the photonic section would change with the cell beating process. Moreover, benefiting from the oblate built-in black background, the color change could be observed and monitored by a camera and an optic spectrometer readily and clearly (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C to E</xref>, and movie S4). In general, the stiffness of the hydrogel could influence the color shift induced by cells: The hydrogel with low stiffness had better responsiveness to the cells, while the highly stiff hydrogel benefited the maintenance of the inverse opal structure. Thus, the 15 weight % (wt %) GelMA was chosen as the optimized concentration for the fabrication of the Janus structure hydrogel.</p><fig id="F6" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>The GelMA hydrogel Janus SCPs for cell culture and monitoring.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the construction of the visualized monitoring platform for cardiomyocytes on the hydrogel Janus SCPs.

To demonstrate their capability, we added the myocardial drug isoproterenol with different concentrations to the cell culture medium to stimulate the cardiomyocytes on the hydrogel SCPs. In general, the spectra of the hydrogel SCPs could have a shift value of about 41 nm. However, with a high concentration of isoproterenol (10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M) in the culture medium, the shift value increased to about 52 nm, and it could be found that the increase in shift value was closely related to the concentration of the isoproterenol; the higher the concentration of isoproterenol the cell medium had, the larger the shift value was (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> and fig. S14A). Besides, the isoproterenol also could regulate the beat frequency of the cardiomyocytes, which exhibited a positive chronotropic response to the concentration of the isoproterenol as well as the shift value did (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> and fig. S14B). These results were the same as the biological effect of isoproterenol in vivo, showing increased beat intensity and frequency. Thus, the real-time spectra detection of the GelMA anisotropic hydrogel SCPs is a promising method for cell sensing, monitoring, and drug evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" disp-level="1"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In summary, we presented a kind of previously unknown anisotropic SCPs by colloidal phase separation of GO and silica nanoparticles in droplets. By adjusting the different parameters in the preparation process, the anisotropic Janus SCPs with the hemispherical colloidal crystal cluster and the oblate GO component could be obtained. It was demonstrated that the designed anisotropic SCPs exhibited brilliant structural colors and the special capabilities of fixation, location, and orientation. More attractively, the derived inverse opal particles of the anisotropic SCPs not only remained the inherent vivid structural colors but were also able to be further used as intelligent responsive materials or excellent microcarriers for three-dimensional cell culture and monitoring. These results all represented the great potentials of the designed particles. Besides, through the further improvement of fabrication process and materials, we believe that the SCPs can achieve more diversified applications in more fields, such as encoding, detection, and catalysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Materials</title><p>Gelatin (from porcine skin), methacrylic anhydride, pancreatin (from porcine pancreas), trypsin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (HMPP), Bis, NIPAM, and octadecyltrichlorosilane were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
