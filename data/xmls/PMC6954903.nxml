For five SLRSV isolates, the complete genome sequences were determined, and for 18 other isolates nearly complete genome sequences were determined. The sequence data were analysed in relation to sequences of SLRSV and related virus isolates available in the NCBI GenBank database. The genome sequences were annotated, and sequences of the protease-polymerase (Pro-Pol) region and coat proteins (CPs) (large and small CP together) were used for phylogenetic analysis. The amino acid sequences of the Pro-Pol region were very similar, whereas the nucleotide sequences of this region were more variable. The amino acid sequences of the CPs were less similar, which was corroborated by the results of a serological comparison performed using antisera raised against different isolates of SLRSV. Based on these results, we propose that SLRSV and related unassigned viruses be assigned to a new genus within the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic>, named &#x0201c;<italic>Stralarivirus</italic>&#x0201d;. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, this genus should include at least three viruses, i.e., SLRSV-A, SLRSV-B and lychnis mottle virus. The newly generated sequence data provide a basis for designing molecular tests to screen for SLRSV.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s00705-019-04437-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Strawberry latent ringspot virus (SLRSV), an unassigned member of the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], was first identified in rosaceous plants by Lister in Scotland more than 50 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Since then, the virus has been reported to infect a broad range of plant species worldwide, including economically important crops such as <italic>Fragaria, Rubus</italic> and <italic>Vitis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and ornamental plants such as <italic>Lilium</italic> spp. (lily) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], <italic>Narcissus</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and <italic>Rosa</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Many hosts infected by SLRSV remain symptomless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, yellow vein banding has been observed in several <italic>Mentha</italic> clones in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, in New Zealand, Tang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] observed chlorotic spots on <italic>Anemone</italic> sp., chlorotic streaks and necrotic rings on <italic>Impatiens walleriana</italic>, chlorotic spots on <italic>Rubu</italic>s spp., chlorotic mottle on <italic>Solanum muricatum</italic>, and vein chlorosis on <italic>Tibouchina</italic> sp. Severe symptoms have been reported on strawberry plants when SLRSV was present in mixed infections with the criniviruses strawberry pallidosis-associated virus and beet pseudo-yellows virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SLRSV has been shown to be transmitted by the nematodes <italic>Xiphinema coxi</italic> and <italic>X. diversicaudatum</italic> and through seed in <italic>Apium graveolens</italic> (celery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], <italic>Chenopodium quinoa</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], <italic>Lamium amplexicaule</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], <italic>Lilium</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], <italic>Rubus idaeus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and <italic>Stellaria media</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recently, molecular characterisation and analysis of SLRSV isolates, including those from new hosts and geographic regions, revealed considerable diversity among isolates of this widespread virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">SLRSV is a non-enveloped virus that forms icosahedral particles with a diameter of approximately 30 nm. The genome comprises two positive-sense ssRNA molecules with an approximate size of 7.5 kb for RNA1 and 3.8 kb for RNA2. Both have a 3&#x02019;-terminal poly(A) tail and a genome-linked virus protein (VPg) covalently bound at the 5&#x02019; end. These RNA molecules are translated into two large polyproteins, which are subsequently cleaved by viral 3C-like proteinases. RNA1 codes for proteins involved in replication, i.e., protease cofactor (Pro-C), helicase (Hel), protease (Pro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol), whereas RNA2 codes for the movement protein (MP) and the large and small coat proteins (CPs). Based on the current genus demarcation criteria described in the 10th Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which include the number of genomic RNA segments, the number of CPs, and the clustering in phylogenetic trees based on aa sequence alignments of the conserved Pro-Pol region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], SLRSV cannot be assigned to any of the genera within the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic>. The same holds for two tentative new members of the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic> that were recently reported in the Republic of Korea, i.e., lychnis mottle virus (LycMoV) from <italic>Lychnis cognate</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and cnidium vein yellowing virus (CnVYV) from <italic>Cnidium officinale</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of both the Pro-Pol region and the CPs of these viruses revealed their close relationship to SLRSV, and these viruses are distinct from all other members of the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic>.</p><p id="Par4">Despite its worldwide occurrence, SLRSV is a regulated pest in many countries. Lily bulbs (<italic>Lilium</italic> spp.) have to be free from SLRSV for export to several Southeast Asian countries. Since lily is a symptomless host, bulbs are routinely tested for SLRSV in the Netherlands. Testing is performed by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). However, testing of various sample sets with different antisera has produced positive but variable serological results. Moreover, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test described by Tang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] failed to detect some isolates that tested positive in DAS-ELISA. This lack of concordance is most likely due to the diversity of the SLRSV isolates tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To gain more insight in the diversity of SLRSV sequences, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was performed on eleven SLRSV isolates from different virus collections and also on a selection of isolates from diagnostic lily samples that reacted differently in serological and molecular tests.</p><p id="Par5">In this paper, we report sequence data and subsequent phylogenetic analysis of 23 SLRSV isolates, which show that these isolates can be separated into at least three distinct clades. This provides evidence for assigning these isolates to three distinct species within the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, including two tentative members of this family, LycMoV and CnVYV, in the phylogenetic analysis supported the assignment of all three of these viruses to a new genus in the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic>, for which the name &#x0201c;<italic>Stralarivirus</italic>&#x0201d; is proposed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Virus isolates</title><p id="Par6">Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides an overview of the SLRSV isolates used in this study.

Comparisons of aa sequences of the Pro-Pol region and the CPs form an important basis for establishing taxonomic relationships within the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic>. The phylogenetic analyses show that all SLRSV isolates, and in addition the recently described LycMoV and CnVYV, form a distinct clade that is clearly separated from the other clades corresponding to genera within the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table S5). The overall level of sequence identity in the Pro-Pol region of the isolates in this SLRSV clade to the other clades/genera is just above 30% for the cheraviruses, just above 29% for the torradoviruses, and well below 30% for the other genera in the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic>.

The first group, designated group A, contains SLRSV isolates from a broad variety of plant species of different geographic origin. Nevertheless, these isolates share significant levels of nt and aa sequence similarity in their CPs, allowing them to be classified as isolates of a single virus species. The two isolates belonging to group B are sufficiently distinct from the isolates in group A in their CPs, with less than 75% aa sequence identity, that they can also be classified as isolates of a distinct species. This distinction is further supported by serological comparisons, showing a clear difference in reactivity in DAS-ELISA between two antisera raised against isolates from the respective groups A and B (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Group C, comprising the two recently described tentative secoviruses LycMoV and CnVYV from medicinal plants from the Korean peninsula and Japan and six isolates from Dutch lilies, also qualifies for classification as a distinct species based on less than 65% aa sequence identity in their CPs to isolates from groups A and B. The limited serological data for this group &#x02013; only one isolate was available for analysis &#x02013; support this classification, but additional serological analyses of other group C isolates are desirable.</p><p id="Par32">Based on their levels of sequence identity in their CPs, these three groups represent distinct species within the newly proposed genus &#x0201c;<italic>Stralarivirus</italic>&#x0201d;. However, this species grouping is not supported by the Pro-Pol regions, in which all show above 88% aa sequence identity.</p><p id="Par33">For species demarcation, however, not all criteria have to always be met. The latest version of the ICTV report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], available online on the ICTV website, states that in cases where the percentage of sequence identity in Pro-Pol and/or CP is near the proposed cutoff, other criteria should be considered and information on biological properties of the virus is useful. For example, beet ringspot virus (BRSV) and tomato black ring virus (TBRV) are considered members of separate species in the genus <italic>Nepovirus.</italic> Although they are closely related in their Pro-Pol sequences (89% aa sequence identity), they are much more divergent in their CP sequences (62% aa sequence identity).

The proposed species (groups A, B and C) are clearly distinguished based on their CP sequences, which is further supported by their serological reactivity. Unfortunately, not enough information about possible additional demarcation criteria is available; vectors have not (yet) been identified, and the host range does not separate the three groups.</p><p id="Par35">Recently Shaffer et al.

Compared to the sequences reported in this paper, the nucleotide sequence identity in this region was 62-72%, 65-68%, and 68-73% (77-83%, 74-83% and 82-86% aa sequence identity) for group A, B and C respectively. Pro-C is the most variable protein in the SLRSV genome (Table S3), and no conclusions about the positioning of the LycMoV from peony within the proposed genus &#x0201c;<italic>Stralarivirus</italic>&#x0201d; can be made from the Pro-C comparisons.</p><p id="Par36">In conclusion, the data presented here show that SLRSV and related isolates of unassigned members (LycMoV and CnVYV) of the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic> form at least three distinct groups in a separate newly proposed genus, &#x0201c;<italic>Stralarivirus</italic>&#x0201d;. Based on current species demarcation criteria for the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic> and additional serological comparisons, these groups can be considered members of three separate virus species within this newly proposed genus. The official names of these species still need to be determined. We propose to designate the virus isolates in group A as SLRSV-A and the isolates in group B as SLRSV-B, because group-specific antisera are currently available. The proposed virus name for the isolates in group C is &#x0201c;lychnis mottle virus&#x0201d; (LycMoV), as this was the first virus isolate described for this group. Finally, besides giving more insight into the variability of SLRSV, the newly generated sequence data may facilitate the design of more-reliable and better-distinguishing molecular tests for screening of routine samples for phytosanitary purposes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
