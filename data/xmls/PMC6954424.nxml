Here, we describe the development of a highly sensitive protein quantification system called HaloTag protein barcoding. The method involves covalent linking of a target protein to a unique molecule counting oligonucleotide at a 1:1 conjugation ratio based on an azido&#x02013;cycloalkyne click reaction. The sensitivity of the HaloTag-based barcoding was remarkably higher than that of a conventional luciferase assay. The HaloTag system was successfully validated by analyzing a set of protein-protein interactions, with the identification rate of 44% protein interactions between positive reference pairs reported in the literature. Desmoglein 3, the target antigen of pemphigus vulgaris, an IgG-mediated autoimmune blistering disease, was used in a HaloTag protein barcode assay to detect the anti-DSG3 antibody. The dynamic range of the assay was over 10<sup>4</sup>-times wider than that of a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The technology was used to detect anti-DSG3 antibody in patient samples with much higher sensitivity compared to conventional ELISA. Our detection system, with its superior sensitivity, enables earlier detection of diseases possibly allowing the initiation of care/treatment at an early disease stage.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Sumitomo Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100008608</named-content></funding-source><award-id>140384</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Protein profiling is a major strategy used in post-transcriptome assays to assign a function to uncharacterized protein-coding genes. It is important not only for gene characterization in basic biological studies but also for medical diagnosis, e.g.&#x000a0;for antibody-based assays of an immune system disorder, such as autoimmune diseases. Approaches based on physical protein interactions include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), protein microarrays, affinity purification-mass spectrometry, and yeast two-hybrid system. These approaches are used to characterize cellular signaling networks and facilitate candidate biomarker discovery (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Conventional protein profiling technologies involve the use of such dedicated platforms as a mass spectrometer or microarray platform (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;12</xref>). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) for investigating genome dynamics has rapidly emerged in the last decade. It is widely available and indispensable technology worldwide. Protein profiling involving NGS has been used to identify target protein molecules, e.g.&#x000a0;for protein&#x02013;protein interaction (PPI) analysis and antibody-transcriptome profiling (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref>). NGS technologies not only increase the number of target molecules that can be assayed at any time but also facilitate detection of target molecules present in low copies because of the nucleic acid amplification involved, regardless of the observed amplification bias (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, to address the NGS-associated amplification bias, multiplexed molecular barcoding methods that minimize the bias have been proposed (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Protein conjugation to DNA molecules is increasingly used for antibody labeling (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), proximity ligation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and cell imaging (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Generally, the target protein is conjugated to another molecule (DNA or a fluorophore) modified by an activated ester, such as <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide, via the amino group of the target protein. The formation of an ester-amine by covalent bonding in a pH-dependent manner can be used to modify proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). On the other hand, conjugation reaction via click chemistry is rapidly emerging for many organic reactions in the biological field because of several advantages, such as pH-insensitivity and reactivity in water with no apparent toxicity (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Here, we report the development of a protein&#x02013;oligonucleotide conjugation method involving a high-affinity capture tag, HaloTag, to link proteins to DNA oligonucleotides, and its application in protein profiling, including antigen&#x02013;antibody interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Preparation of a barcoded HaloTag protein complex</title><p>The initial preparation of the HaloTag-barcoded-protein was performed using a first-generation set of custom proteins, HaloTag protein G (1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan), NanoLuc-HaloTag (8 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l, NL-HaloTag; Promega, USA), HaloTag-FOS proto-oncogene proteins (40 ng/&#x003bc;l, HaloTag-FOS; Cell Free Science, Japan), and HaloTag-Glutathione S-transferase (3 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l, HaloTag-GST; Promega).

The mixture was then washed three times with 500 &#x003bc;l PBS-NP40 and the washed beads were boiled in 100 &#x003bc;l PBS-NP40 at 90&#x000b0;C for 5 min. The barcoded proteins in the boiled mixture were quantified using qPCR, which was performed using the LightCycler 480 (Roche, Switzerland) and KAPA SYBR FAST (Sigma Aldrich, USA). For each reaction, standard curves for each DNA barcode were constructed using 5 serial dilutions of the DNA barcode. The relative amount of the barcode DNA was calculated by comparing with the standard curves. Specific primers (primer 1: 5&#x02032;- ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3&#x02032;; and primer 2: 5&#x02032;-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-3&#x02032;) for qPCR were designed for the following conditions: 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C; followed by &#x0223c;35&#x000a0;cycles of 30 s at 95&#x000b0;C and 45 s at 60&#x000b0;C; 100-bp products were thus generated in triplicate. For the well-known JUN-FOS PPI assay (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), the sequence encoding a hexa histidine-tagged (6&#x000d7; His-tag) HaloTag-JUN was cloned into pEU-E01-MCS vector (Cell Free Science) and the protein synthesized <italic>in situ</italic> from plasmid DNA using the SP6 TNT wheat germ system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Then, 25 &#x003bc;l of the bait protein (HaloTag-JUN) was mixed by rotating with 10 &#x003bc;l Halo magnetic beads (Promega) in a total volume of 100 &#x003bc;l in PBS&#x02013;NP40 at RT for 1 h. Subsequently, beads with the HaloTag-JUN fusion protein were washed and added to 25 &#x003bc;l of the prey protein (barcoded HaloTag-FOS, 25 nM, or HaloTag protein only, 50 nM, as determined by qPCR), and then mixed by rotating at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h. The formed complex was then washed three times with 500 &#x003bc;l PBS-NP40 and the washed beads were boiled in 100 &#x003bc;l PBS-NP40 at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min. The barcoded proteins in the boiled mixture were quantified by using qPCR, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-3"><title>Detection of the NanoLuc fusion-barcoded proteins</title><p>The sensitivity of the barcoding assay was evaluated by determining the number of DNA oligonucleotides on the barcoded proteins. Dilution series of the barcoded proteins were prepared, and DNA was amplified using a set of specific primer combinations and by indexing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), using Mighty Amp DNA polymerase PCR (Takara, Japan). The barcoded DNA template was PCR-amplified as follows: 2 min at 98&#x000b0;C; followed by 4 cycles of 10 s at 98&#x000b0;C, 10 s at 60&#x000b0;C, and 1 min at 68&#x000b0;C; 25 cycles of 10 s at 98&#x000b0;C, 2 s at 60&#x000b0;C and 1 min at 68&#x000b0;C; and a final extension step of 5 min at 68&#x000b0;C. The amplified DNA was purified by using the Agencourt AMPure XP kit (Beckman, USA), and the quality of the DNA library was assessed by using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer. The amplified 174-bp products, including the Illumina adapter and index sequence, were analyzed using the MiSeq system (Illumina, USA) with dual-indexed sequencing in a paired-end flow cell, to read 76 bp, including the amplified 38 bp of the barcode DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, blue and red, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). After sequencing various mixed fusion protein libraries, each protein was identified by the 8-bp protein barcode sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, red, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) using Bowtie2 v.2.2.9 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).

Barcode-based protein molecule counting methods were as described elsewhere, using the parameters: <italic>Distance</italic>, 2; <italic>fixed base number</italic>, 6; and <italic>random base number</italic>, 24 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Briefly, the counting barcode region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, blue, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), a 30-bp sequence tag, was used to determine the molecule number after identifying each protein based on the 8-bp protein barcode sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, red, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).

Following the filtering, an in-house clustering software &#x02018;Nucleotide Sequence Clusterizer&#x02019; was used for barcode clustering to determine the number of protein molecules (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>NanoLuc luciferase assays were performed in triplicate experiments using the Nano-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega), as recommended by the manufacturer.

The developed click chemistry-based protocols eliminate the cumbersome process of complex preparation involving the amido-bond-based method. To develop the new method, 2 types of azido-HaloTag ligand, AzHLT-1 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and AzHLT-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Method and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>), were used in a strain-promoted click reaction with cycloalkyne-modified 100-bp DNA oligonucleotides. For the HaloTag ligand&#x02013;oligonucleotide complex formation by click labeling, 2 &#x003bc;l 500 &#x003bc;M DNA 5&#x02032;-modified by dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>; Eurofins) was mixed with 0.5 &#x003bc;l 500 &#x003bc;M azido-HaloTag ligand in water (4:1), and incubated at RT for 1 h (click reaction). The complex was then used to directly create a DNA&#x02013;HaloTag fusion protein complex. Specifically, 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g HaloTag fusion proteins were mixed with 1 &#x003bc;l of the ligand&#x02013;oligonucleotide complex, and incubated at RT for 1 h. The DNA&#x02013;HaloTag fusion protein complex was then purified by histidine tag purification (Mettler Toledo, USA) to eliminate unbound DNA, azido-HaloTag ligand and the HaloTag ligand&#x02013;oligonucleotide complex. Since the preparation of the HaloTag-barcoded proteins is very simple and the AzHTL-1 ligand captured more protein than the AzHTL-2 ligand, the AzHTL-1 ligand was used for the preparation of all proteins by HaloTag barcoding for the subsequent interaction assay.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-5"><title>Vector construction</title><p>Vector pIX-His-HALO was constructed by inserting a sequence encoding a 6&#x000d7; His-tag by PCR using the histidine cassette primers (primer 1: 5&#x02032;-GTGATGATGCATGATATCTGTAGTTGTAGAATGT-3&#x02032;; and primer 2: 5&#x02032;-CATCACCACGCAGAAATCGGTACTGGCTTTCCAT-3&#x02032;) downstream of the T7 promoter on the pIX-Halo:ccdB vector (11; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=vector&#x00026;id=1001200298">https://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=vector&#x00026;id=1001200298</ext-link>).

The PPI assays were performed using Magne HaloTag beads (Promega), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the reference protein set were inserted into vector pIX-His-Halo:ccdB (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) using the Gateway LR recombination cloning system (Invitrogen, USA). The LR recombination products were then used to transform competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1;-T1R cells. Single colonies of the transformants were picked from LB agarose medium (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin, the clones were cultured in 5 ml liquid terrific broth medium (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) overnight at 37&#x000b0;C, and plasmid DNA was purified using a DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Germany). The proteins were expressed from pIX-His-Halo vectors using a T7 TNT-coupled wheat germ extract system for protein expression (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. HaloTag-fused proteins were then labeled with a Halo ligand&#x02013;oligonucleotide complex prepared by click chemistry. Briefly, 150 &#x003bc;l synthesized proteins (unpurified reference protein set) was mixed with 1 &#x003bc;l ligand&#x02013;oligonucleotide complex in 5 mM EDTA, and incubated at RT for 1 h. This was followed by histidine tag column purification (Mettler Toledo) and dialysis into PBS buffer using an Amicon-ultra 10k column (Merck-Millipore, Germany). The barcoded proteins were treated with HaloTag ligand (Promega) at RT for 1 h to fill the empty HaloTag ligand capture sites; 25 &#x003bc;l bait protein (pIX-His-HALO-ORFs) produced using the TNT-coupled wheat germ extract (Promega) was mixed with 5 &#x003bc;l Magne HaloTag beads and incubated at RT for 1 h. The beads coupled with bait proteins were then washed with PBS and mixed with 5 &#x003bc;l barcoded proteins at RT for 2 h. The mixture was next washed 3 times with PBS and used for library preparation for NGS.

A solution-based technology, e.g.&#x000a0;protein complex purification coupled with mass spectrometry, plays an important role in assay biochemistry, as it is not limited by the need to anchor the target protein to a solid support, as in, e.g.&#x000a0;protein array, which may limit the accessibility of the target protein to the query protein, affecting their interaction. We have developed a new method for assaying protein molecules involving a high-affinity capture tag, the HaloTag (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), to capture a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide barcode connected to a synthesized protein. We called this system &#x02018;HaloTag barcode assay&#x02019; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This technology enables determination of the number of protein molecules with a wider than heretofore sensitivity range using the protein-attached oligonucleotide. The assay was designed to facilitate proper protein folding, as the capture does not require any solid support, such as polysaccharide polymer beads, glass microscope slides, etc. HaloTag-based protein labeling has several advantages over other labeling approaches, e.g.&#x000a0;ones relying on the biotin&#x02013;avidin interaction, as a useful tool for protein labeling. HaloTag-labeled proteins irreversibly bind to a small chemical ligand chloroalkane in a 1:1 ratio and, hence, the correct numbers of the fused protein molecules can be easily determined. By contrast, a single molecule of avidin can interact non-covalently with up to 4 biotin molecules (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The size of the HaloTag (33 kDa) is relatively small compared with that of avidin (&#x0223c;70 kDa) or streptavidin analogs (&#x0223c;50 kDa), the latter of which could interfere with complex formation during protein interactions. In addition, as the used oligonucleotide also binds the HaloTag in a 1:1 ratio (instead of 1:4, as for of biotin&#x02013;avidin binding), the small size of the protein&#x02013;oligonucleotide conjugate by HaloTag compared to biotin-avidin binding allows for appropriate interactions of the labeled protein with other proteins. A previously developed HaloTag-mediated conjugation method used a 220-bp double-stranded DNA with Acrydite modification to label protein (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We have modified the system by using a newly developed 100mer oligonucleotide containing a unique molecule counting barcode of a semi-random sequence, protein identifier, and a sequencing adaptor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). To link the HaloTag fusion protein with the barcode, we created amine-modified 100mer oligonucleotides conjugated with HaloTag O4 ester ligand (see Materials and Methods for details). After purification of the ligand&#x02013;oligonucleotide complex, the HaloTag fusion protein is covalently bound to a ligand&#x02013;oligonucleotide complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We purified the DNA&#x02013;HaloTag fusion protein complex, the &#x02018;DNA-barcoded protein&#x02019; by HPLC, and used it to determine the protein numbers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Since protein activity depends on its ability to complex with other proteins, the folding of a multidomain protein in any organism is important for its function. To test whether the activity of the HaloTag-fused protein bound with an oligonucleotide DNA-barcoded protein was retained, we used two pairs of well-studied protein interaction pairs, protein G-IgG and JUN-FOS. Using the HaloTag barcode assay, we conjugated DNA barcodes with protein G and FOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A and B</xref>). We then tested the interaction between these barcoded proteins and their known interacting proteins, IgG and JUN, respectively; this was combined with qPCR quantification. Indeed, both barcoded proteins interacted with their respective protein partners, in agreement with previous reports (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).

These complexes were prepared in a dilution series based on qPCR quantification, and complex levels were simultaneously assayed by DNA barcode sequencing and luciferase activity determination (see Materials and Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S5 and S6</xref>). A direct comparison of the two assays for NL-HaloTag is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>. The HaloTag barcode assay was able to detect 1000-fold less protein than the NanoLuc luciferase assay. Similarly, the sensitivity of HaloTag assays with NL-HaloTag-JUN or -FOS fusion proteins was higher (approximately 100-fold) than that of the luciferase assay, although the sensitivity was smaller than that of the NL-HaloTag fusion protein (&#x0223c;1000-fold) in both assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>). This suggests that the large size of a protein or protein fusion can reduce the sensitivity of both assays as the size may inhibit luciferase activity and hinder the amplification of the barcode DNA fused to the proteins. The reads of barcoded proteins that exceeded 10 units (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>) above the background level were considered to be valid, indicating that the assayed proteins were highly abundant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S5 and S6</xref>). The reads were scored as background noise if the mapped reads of barcodes used in the assay were less than 3 SD+average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>) of the unmapped barcode reads, which were not used in the assay. The superior sensitivity of the HaloTag assay is most likely associated with the appreciably higher sensitivity of DNA amplification by PCR than that of bioluminescence, which enables the capture of even single molecules of the barcoded protein, with improved efficiency of detection of the barcoded protein. The HaloTag barcode assay highlights the advantages of using DNA instead of the conventional assays to detect protein levels.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>Detecting protein interactions by click-HaloTag barcode assays</title><p>Understanding the physical PPI is key for understanding cellular signaling networks, e.g.&#x000a0;transcription machinery or proteasome degradation.

Further, for this particular protein profiling method, we developed a click chemistry based conjugation approach for preparing HaloTag-barcoded proteins, the click-HaloTag barcoding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Compared with the amine-ester reaction described above, the click-HaloTag barcode conjugation method is cost- and time-effective and may be conducted in water with no chromatography purification steps required. For the conjugation, we examined the ability of two robust custom azido-HaloTag ligands (AzHLT-1 and AzHLT-2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref> and Supplementary Methods) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) to bind with cycloalkyne-modified oligonucleotides. No ligand-oligonucleotide conjugate purification by HPLC was required, and the HaloTag fusion proteins were directly covalently bound to the ligand-oligonucleotide complex. Although both azido-HaloTag ligands could be used for the conjugation of the complex, the AzHLT-1 ligand, with a relatively more reactive alkyl azido group, captured up to five times more protein than the AzHTL-2 ligand with an aromatic azido group, as revealed by direct detection of captured proteins using a tetramethylrhodamine fluorescent (TMR)-modified 100-bp oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). After conjugating DNA and protein using the AzHTL-1 ligand, we confirmed that no active HaloTag was present in the reaction mixture although non-barcoded HaloTag proteins were indeed observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>, lane 2, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>, lane 2).

PV is a rare autoimmune disease that causes mucocutaneous blister mediated by autoantibody targeting a cell-cell adhesion molecule (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Detection of a specific autoantibody against the main target autoantigen, DSG3, in the patient's serum by ELISA is a key serological diagnostic criterion for appropriate assessment of the disease. To develop a method for detecting the autoantibody with improved sensitivity, we created barcoded DSG3 protein by using click chemistry. Using a monoclonal anti-DSG3 antibody generated from the PV model mouse as a mimic of the autoantibody from human patients, we compared the dynamic range of the HaloTag barcode assay and that of conventional ELISA. The results of the barcode assay using HaloTag-fused DSG3 are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>. The assay showed the greatest sensitivity when a 10<sup>8</sup> anti-DSG3 antibody dilution was used.

We considered the possibility that the commercial ELISA assay kit detected the structure of DSG3 protein captured in the assay plate well that was different from that of barcoded DSG3 protein. To address this potential structural artifact, we immobilized the HaloTag fusion DSG3 protein on a HaloTag ligand-coated 96 well plate (the HaloLink plate). The HaloLink plate (Promega) captures approximately 10 ng/mL of HaloTag-GST (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Similar to the ELISA plate, the maximum signal/noise range of 1 ng of HaloTag fusion DSG3 was observed for 10<sup>4</sup> antibody dilution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). Although we were able to detect protein-protein interactions including antigen&#x02013;antibody interactions, whether the assay would improve real-life diagnosis needed further investigation. Therefore, we applied the barcode assay to determine the presence of the anti-DSG3 antibody in two patients with PV and two healthy volunteers. Our detection system showed superior sensitivity and could detect the presence of the anti-DSG3 antibody in the patient serum, which was diluted 10<sup>6</sup> times Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>), while conventional ELISA had a lower detection limit at a dilution of 10<sup>2</sup> times (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The sensitivity of the barcode assay could be attributed not only to the high sensitivity of DNA amplification but also to antibody enrichment by bead capture in aqueous solution, as compared with dispersed antigen-capture on the ELISA plate. In addition, in the ELISA plate assay, the target protein is anchored to a solid support, which may limit the accessibility of the antibody to the target protein, whereas the barcode assay does not involve such anchoring. Hence, the barcoded antigen can capture more antibodies, resulting in a more efficient interaction than ELISA.

However, because large HaloTag ORF collections already exist for two organisms, human (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kazusa.or.jp/kop/halotag/">http://www.kazusa.or.jp/kop/halotag/</ext-link>) and Arabidopsis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/abrc/halo_tagged_orf_clones.jsp">https://www.arabidopsis.org/abrc/halo_tagged_orf_clones.jsp</ext-link>), all assays in the current study involved HaloTag barcoding. Using a protein interaction assay involving known positive protein pairs, we demonstrated that the developed conjugation assay detects significantly more valid interactions than negative interactions. This suggested that PPIs are likely not affected by the conjugation of 100mer oligonucleotides to proteins. However, we were unable to exclude the possibility that the target (prey) or bait protein itself could bind to a random conjugated DNA barcode. Therefore, interaction studies using the developed methods should be performed with suitable caution and should be followed by additional validation. Regardless of the possible nonspecific DNA conjugation to proteins, the main reason for performing the assays in aqueous solutions and with improved sensitivity is the detection of low-copy number proteins. The range of molecule numbers that can be counted by using HaloTag barcoding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>, limit of 3.3 molecules from background average) are most likely the same as those of other technologies, such as zero-mode waveguide, total internal reflection microscopy, and single molecule ELISA, which enable the detection of a single fluorescent molecule (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Although the reflection microscopy enables observation of a single molecule in real-time, an important reason for using the barcoding assay is the ability to efficiently quantify protein molecules without fluorescent diffusion. The indispensable NGS technology is widely available and eliminates the need to prepare a solid support for micro/nanofluidic technology. Hence, introduction of bias may be avoided by using the barcoding assay.</p><p>The lower sensitivity of detecting HaloTag fusion proteins compared to that of HaloTag alone suggests that the size and/or structure of protein could affect the sensitivity of the barcoding assay. Hence, the small size of a single-stranded oligonucleotide barcode potentially facilitates the interaction with a target antibody or protein, by avoiding access constraints to the target protein that may be imposed by double-stranded DNA. Considering that the diameter of the HaloTag protein is 3.3 nm, using a 100-bp oligonucleotide, a flexible 1-nm persistence length, would result in a relatively small size of a barcoded protein complex in comparison with the same-length double-stranded DNA (33 nm), a helix structure of 50-nm persistence length (150 bp) (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the relatively low rate (44%) of positive PPI detection by the barcode assay in comparison with the previously reported detection rate of a pull-down assay (63%) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), might be associated with the barcode. Such lower rate might be caused not only by structural limitations but also by the negatively charged oligonucleotide, which could change some target protein characteristics, such as isoelectric point or hydrophobicity. The HaloTag barcoding technology would be readily available to detect PPI in a multiplex assay with multiple barcoded proteins. For example, multiplexed barcoded antigen proteins DSG1 and 3, which are functionally compensatory, could be utilized for a quantitative and sensitive detection to distinguish two autoantibodies related to PV and pemphigus foliaceus (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). The main advantages of the assay are the aqueous solution-based multiplexing detection capability and superior sensitivity. Since the system uses an aqueous-based assay, there is no limitation for the number of multiplexed barcoded proteins that can be used. The aqueous system does not limit the access to the antibody, and the barcoded antigens bind to the antibodies in the test sample with very high sensitivity. The click-HaloTag barcode conjugation eliminates the cumbersome steps of conjugation complex formation, pH adjustments, purification by chromatography, and the use of organic solvents. However, the click chemistry based conjugation methods still require the expression of each prey protein separately prior to the assay. Also, all complexes formed should be purified separately similar to that in the amido bond-based method.</p><p>Although the HaloTag system has a smaller conjugation size than that of the biotin/avidin system, it is not &#x02018;small.&#x02019; A 33 kDa HaloTag is larger than a GFP tag and may interfere with the protein&#x02013;protein interaction as well. However, the 1:1 conjugation ratio of the HaloTag prevents improper folding of barcoded proteins because of the small complex size, as compared with other conjugation methods, e.g.&#x000a0;the widely used biotin&#x02013;avidin (1:4) interaction and non-scalable amine&#x02013;ester protein (antibody) barcoding (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Further, the developed click chemistry-based HaloTag DNA linking methods may help improve protein capture on the HaloTag protein array (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and be used instead of the bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate crosslinker, which forms a paste during spotting solution preparation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Using the linking methods, DNA-conjugated HaloTag-fused protein could be captured on an amine-coated solid support by the ligand&#x02013;oligonucleotide complex instead of bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate. Using this method to evaluate a set of barcoded proteins to identify their target proteins, such antigen/antibody pairs could constitute an accurate detection approach, with superior sensitivity and throughput. We demonstrate that the applicability of the HaloTag barcoding assay and the technique add a new dimension to protein detection for an especially small number of target proteins, such as autoantibodies, because of the higher assay sensitivity due to the use of nucleic acids, compared to conventional assays that use fluorescent molecules or enzyme reactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). For the clinical diagnosis of real-life conditions such as PV in the future, the false-discovery rate of the assay should be estimated, and the sensitivity should be determined by benchmarking against conventional chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays using sample pairs consisting of patients with PV and healthy volunteers. In conclusion, the developed method can be used to facilitate extremely early-stage diagnosis of human diseases. In addition to barcoding HaloTag fusion proteins, click chemistry-based barcoding can be readily applied to antibodies, of which large collections already exist. We envision that the click-based barcoding technology will be adapted for other applications, including antibody labeling to help identify cell specificity and cancer specificity and contribute to the diagnosis of human disease.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>IN-HOUSE MATERIALS, PROGRAMS AND DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The two types of azido-HaloTag ligand, AzHLT-1 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and AzHLT-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Method and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>), used to develop the new method are available upon request from T.H.
