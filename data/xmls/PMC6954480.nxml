Methylglyoxal (MGO), a major precursor of AGEs, has been reported to induce insulin resistance in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> seeds (PCS) have been used as a traditional medicine for several diseases, but their potential application in treating insulin resistance has not yet been evaluated. This study is aimed at investigating whether PCS extract could attenuate insulin resistance induced by MGO. Male C57BL/6N mice (6 weeks old) were administered 1% MGO in their drinking water for 18 weeks, and the PCS extract (200 or 500&#x02009;mg/kg) was orally administered daily from the first day of the MGO administration. We observed that both 200 and 500&#x02009;mg/kg PCS extract treatment significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and markedly restored p-Akt and p-IRS1/2 expression in the livers of the MGO-administered mice. Additionally, the PCS extract significantly increased the phosphorylation of Akt and IRS-1/2 and glucose uptake in MGO-treated HepG2 cells. Further studies showed that the PCS extract inhibited MGO-induced AGE formation in the HepG2 cells and in the sera of MGO-administered mice. PCS extract also increased the expression of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) in the liver tissue of MGO-administered mice. The PCS extract significantly decreased the phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and suppressed the mRNA expression of proinflammatory molecules including TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and iNOS in MGO-administered mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that the PCS extract attenuated oxidative stress, as evidenced by the reduced ROS production in the MGO-treated cells and the enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes in the liver of MGO-administered mice. Thus, PCS extract ameliorated the MGO-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells and in mice by reducing oxidative stress via the inhibition of AGE formation. These findings suggest the potential of PCS extract as a candidate for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Ministry of Education</funding-source><award-id>NRF-2016R1A6A3A11930857</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Ministry of Health and Welfare</funding-source><award-id>HI14C1135</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Insulin is an essential hormone produced by pancreatic <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cells, which acts to transport glucose from the bloodstream into cells for conversion into energy [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The reduction in the responsiveness of tissues to the normal action of insulin is referred to as insulin resistance [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Many studies have indicated that insulin resistance plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance is also strongly associated with several metabolic conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the etiology of insulin resistance remains controversial, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been increasingly recognized as one of the contributing factors [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound, is a major precursor of the AGEs. MGO mainly reacts with the arginine residues and, to a much lesser extent, with lysine residues, to form MGO-derived AGEs [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Once AGEs are formed, these irreversible products interact with the receptors for AGEs (RAGE) resulting in inflammation and the elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are also closely linked to insulin resistance [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. AGEs contribute to two harmful factors, inflammation and oxidative stress, which lead to the development of insulin resistance. Thus, inhibition of AGE formation may be a potential strategy to counteract this condition.</p><p>
<italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> L., commonly known as &#x0201c;Boh-Gol-Zhee&#x0201d; in Korea, has been widely used for the treatment of various pathological conditions, such as skin disorders, cancer, inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and kidney disease [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Every part of this plant is useful, with the seeds of <italic>P. corylifolia</italic> reported to contain six major components (bakuchiol, isopsoralen, psoralen, corylifolin, corylin, and psoralidin), all of which are potent antioxidants [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Particularly, bakuchiol protects against hepatic injury [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, treatment with the <italic>P. corylifolia</italic> seed (PCS) extract can significantly improve hyperglycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in C57BL/6 mice [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and psoralen and isopsoralen have preventive effects against oxidative stress-induced beta-cell death and antitumor effects [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the efficacy of the PCS extract in MGO-induced insulin resistance remains unexplored. Thus, this study is aimed at investigating whether the PCS extract attenuates MGO-induced insulin resistance <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and determining the underlying mechanisms related to its effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Preparation of PCS Extract</title><p>PCS was purchased from an oriental drug store (Kwang Myung Dang Co., Ulsan, Korea), and the extraction was performed as described previously [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, the dried seeds (300&#x02009;g) were ground into small pieces and extracted twice with 3&#x02009;L of distilled water under reflux. The extract was stored in a freezer (-80&#x000b0;C) for 24&#x02009;h before it was evaporated in vacuo to produce a dark brownish residue.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Animal Experiment</title><p>Male C57BL/6N mice (5 weeks old) were obtained from Orient Bio Inc. (Seongnam, Gyeonggi, Korea). All animals were subjected to a 12&#x02009;h light/dark cycle and provided with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Mice were acclimatized for 1 week prior to experimentation and divided into the following five treatment groups based on the body weight and blood glucose levels: CON (control), MGO (1% in water, approximately 1460&#x02009;mg/kg/day), MGO+PCS extract (200&#x02009;mg/kg/day), MGO+PCS extract (500&#x02009;mg/kg/day), and MGO+AG (30&#x02009;mg/kg). Mice were treated with MGO in drinking water. PCS extract and AG were administered to the mice by oral gavage for 18 weeks. The body weight, food intake, and water intake were recorded daily, and the blood glucose level was measured every week. At the end of the experiment, half the mice in each group were stimulated with insulin (intraperitoneal injection, 1.5&#x02009;U/kg) for 10&#x02009;min before sacrifice (<italic>n</italic> = 8, each group).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3.

PCS Extract Improves Glucose Tolerance and Insulin Sensitivity in MGO-Administered Mice</title><p>To investigate whether the PCS extracts have beneficial effects on MGO-induced insulin resistance, mice were orally administered the PCS extract (200 or 500&#x02009;mg/kg) for 18 weeks while simultaneously receiving 1% MGO in the drinking water. Blood glucose levels were significantly higher in MGO-administered mice at 60&#x02009;min and 90&#x02009;min after the glucose load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). In addition, calculation of the glucose area under the curve (AUC) revealed that AUC was significantly higher in the MGO-administered group as compared to the CON group, and treatment with the PCS extract at 200 and 500&#x02009;mg/kg significantly reduced AUC after the glucose load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Moreover, the administration of aminoguanidine (AG) significantly decreased the blood glucose level in MGO-administered mice (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). In the ITT, insulin sensitivity was markedly reduced after 18 weeks of MGO treatment, as demonstrated by the higher blood glucose levels, compared to the CON group after insulin injection (at 30, 90, and 120&#x02009;min). This reduced insulin sensitivity was attenuated by the administration of 200&#x02009;mg/kg PCS extract, and significant results were observed with the 500&#x02009;mg/kg dose of PCS. The AG treatment did not show significant hypoglycemic effects in the MGO-administered mice (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2.

The administration of MGO markedly decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and IRS1/2 in liver tissue with insulin stimulation, compared to the CON group.

PCS Extract Increases Insulin-Stimulated Glucose Uptake and the Expressions of p-Akt and p-IRS1/2 in MGO-Treated HepG2 Cells</title><p>To determine the conditions under which MGO can induce insulin resistance without cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells, the cells were treated with various concentrations of MGO (0.1&#x02013;100&#x02009;mM) for 24&#x02009;h or 48&#x02009;h, and cell viability was evaluated. The proportion of viable cells was significantly decreased by 1&#x02009;mM MGO at both times, with a dose-dependent decrease with increasingly greater doses (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref>). We then checked the cell viability after treatment with 1&#x02009;mM MGO for different incubation times (0&#x02013;24&#x02009;h). The number of viable cells was significantly decreased at 24&#x02009;h after the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref>). Therefore, we chose the conditions of 1&#x02009;mM MGO for 12&#x02009;h, in which the number of viable cells was not reduced, for the subsequent experiments. In addition, HepG2 cells were treated with various concentrations of the PCS extract (50&#x02013;500&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) for 24&#x02009;h or 48&#x02009;h to check whether the PCS extract displayed any cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells before <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. PCS extracts did not show any cytotoxicity at all tested concentrations and time points (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(d)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref>).</p><p>We examined whether MGO induces insulin resistance in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were treated with various concentrations of MGO (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5, 1&#x02009;mM) for 12&#x02009;h, and p-Akt expression was examined by western blotting. The treatment with 1&#x02009;mM MGO significantly decreased the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt compared to the cells without MGO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). To investigate whether the PCS extract produced any beneficial effects on MGO-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells, we first examined the effects of the PCS extract on glucose uptake in HepG2 cells. Treatment with MGO significantly decreased the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake compared to the cells receiving no MGO treatment.

Discussion</title><p>MGO is the most important and well-studied precursor of AGEs [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This highly reactive dicarbonyl metabolite reacts with arginine or lysine residues of proteins to form AGEs [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Accumulation of AGEs has been reported to contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress via the overproduction of ROS, which are recognized as contributing factors in insulin resistance [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This study is aimed at investigating the ameliorative effects of the PCS extract on the insulin resistance induced by MGO.</p><p>Insulin resistance is generally defined as a reduced response of target tissues, such as the skeletal muscle, liver, and adipocytes, to insulin [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Insulin exerts its effects by binding to the insulin receptors, which induce the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues on insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. The phosphorylation of IRS results in the activation of Akt, which stimulates the translocation of glucose transporter (GLUT) from the cytosol to the cell membrane, facilitating glucose uptake into cells [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that treatment with 0.5&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;mM MGO resulted in insulin resistance in L6 cells and HepG2 cells [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, several studies have reported the direct effects of AGEs on insulin action <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the present study, PCS extract significantly reduced MGO-induced insulin resistance, resulting in the recovery of glucose uptake in the insulin-stimulated HepG2 cells. In addition, we also investigated the effect of PCS extract on MGO-induced insulin resistance <italic>in vivo</italic>. To induce insulin resistance, we used a supraphysiological dose of MGO for oral administration, which is a limitation to our study. Nevertheless, the PCS extract significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in MGO-administered mice. Consistently, phosphorylation of biomolecules in the insulin signaling pathway, such as Akt and IRS1/2, was increased in the liver tissue of MGO-administered mice treated with PCS extract. Collectively, these findings indicate that the PCS extract ameliorated the MGO-induced insulin resistance <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>MGO can form AGEs, and AGEs might be the messenger in the signaling that causes insulin resistance. Blockage of AGE formation can be considered as a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract the glycation-induced insulin resistance. Therefore, we first investigated whether the PCS extract can affect AGE formation induced by MGO. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of the PCS extract on AGE formation induced by MGO. MGO induced a significant increase in the formation of AGEs after 7 days of incubation with BSA. The PCS extract (50&#x02013;500&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) inhibited the MGO-induced AGE formation in a dose-dependent manner. <italic>In vivo</italic>, treatment with PCS extract significantly suppressed the serum AGE level in MGO-administered mice. These findings suggest that PCS extract can inhibit AGE formation.</p><p>Many natural products, including the extracts of herbal plants, mung beans, peanuts, or natural compounds, such as quercetin and myricitrin, have been reported to inhibit the formation of AGEs induced by MGO [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that natural products block the MGO-induced AGE formation through the trapping of MGO [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This MGO trapping mechanism by flavonoids from natural products involves the trapping of the reactive dicarbonyl MGO species at the two unsubstituted positions 6 and 8 in the A-ring, the major active sites of flavonoids. This results in the formation of mono- and di-MGO adducts, especially under alkaline conditions, owing to the high electron density upon dissociation of a hydrogen atom from two hydroxyl groups [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It has also been reported that natural extracts, such as <italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic> (peanut) extract and <italic>Garcinia indica</italic> fruit rind extract, inhibit AGE formation as effective chain-cleavage antioxidants or as free radical scavengers by chelating trace metal ions included in the phosphate buffer, which catalyze glycation [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We believe that inhibition of AGE formation by the PCS extract may have resulted via a similar mechanism.</p><p>In the physiological environment, MGO is mainly formed as a byproduct of glycolysis and is detoxified to D-lactate by the glyoxalase system. In this process, glyoxalase I (GLO1) is the most crucial enzyme [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, PCS extract treatment increased GLO1 protein levels in MGO-treated cells. This indicates that PCS extract may inhibit glycation effect by inhibiting AGE formation through the trapping of MGO and also due to the degradation of MGO by GLO1.</p><p>The AGE-RAGE interaction stimulates various signaling cascades, including MAPK, such as p38 and ERK-1/2, and this signaling cascade can activate NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B, which, in turn, is followed by an increased expression of cytokines [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It has been reported that AGEs stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, via activation of the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B signaling pathway [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our results showed that MGO treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B, ERK, and p38, as well as the mRNA expression of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and iNOS. The treatment with PCS extract significantly suppressed all these deleterious effects induced by MGO in the liver tissue of MGO-administrated mice. Therefore, PCS extract inhibited AGE formation, thus inhibiting the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, and contributed to the inhibition of inflammatory molecule expression.</p><p>TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> directly induce ROS production and also increase the expression of iNOS, which can produce ROS and RNS [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, we checked the effects of the PCS extract on MGO-induced ROS production in HepG2 cells. As expected, treatment with PCS extract reduced the ROS production in MGO-treated HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, PCS extract treatment recovered the activity of GPx and increased protein expression of antioxidant enzymes including SOD1, SOD2, and HO-1 in the liver tissue of the MGO-administered mice. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that PCS extract also reduces the ROS level by the downregulation of the controlling antioxidant enzymes, as the removal of ROS is regulated by several antioxidant enzymes, including GPx, SOD1, SOD2, and HO-1 [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, consistent with these results, previous studies have reported that PCS extract possesses antioxidant effects and protects against mitochondrial dysfunction induced by oxidative stress in HepG2 cells [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, PCS extract attenuated the MGO-induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells and also in an animal model. PCS extract suppressed AGE production by MGO trapping and MGO degradation and subsequently inhibited AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, contributing to the attenuation of insulin resistance. These findings implicate PCS extract as a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the Korea Health Technology R&#x00026;D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) funded by the Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare (HI14C1135) and by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2016R1A6A3A11930857).</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data and figures used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Cao-Sang Truong and Eunhui Seo contributed equally to this work.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>R&#x000f6;der</surname><given-names>P.
