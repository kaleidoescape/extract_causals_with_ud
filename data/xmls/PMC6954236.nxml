We show that loss of the prolyl hydroxylase domain isoform 1 oxygen sensor in mice (PHD1<sup>KO</sup>) reduces muscle mass. PHD1<sup>KO</sup> muscles show impaired mTORC1 activation in response to leucine whereas mTORC1 activation by growth factors or eccentric contractions was preserved. The ability of PHD1 to promote mTORC1 activity is independent of its hydroxylation activity but is caused by decreased protein content of the leucyl tRNA synthetase (LRS) leucine sensor. Mechanistically, PHD1 interacts with and stabilizes LRS. This interaction is promoted during oxygen and amino acid depletion and protects LRS from degradation. Finally, elderly subjects have lower PHD1 levels and LRS activity in muscle from aged versus young human subjects. In conclusion, PHD1 ensures an optimal mTORC1 response to leucine after episodes of metabolic scarcity.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">mTORC1 is an important regulator of muscle mass.

From the age of 50, skeletal muscle mass is lost at a rate of 1&#x02013;2% per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, resulting in diminished functional strength that correlates with lower overall quality of life and increased mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Muscle is also critical component of diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, diabetes, cancer, anemia, and sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The clinical and financial burden of loss of muscle mass to society is enormous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and it is therefore vital to develop strategies to prevent loss of muscle mass, or to maintain and even increase muscle mass. To do so, we need to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms that control skeletal muscle mass.</p><p id="Par4">Skeletal muscle mass is defined by a fine balance between protein synthesis and breakdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, processes which are governed by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of cellular metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Growth factors, energetic stress, and contractions control mTORC1 directly or via its upstream inhibitor tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Amino acids regulate mTORC1 via alternative pathways involving Rag GTPases, which recruit mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. How TSC2-dependent signals regulate mTORC1 in skeletal muscle has been intensely studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, but how fluctuations of amino acids, and in particular the essential amino acid leucine, regulate mTORC1, and thus skeletal muscle mass in vivo is much less well understood.</p><p id="Par5">Over the last years, intense research efforts have led to the discovery of leucine sensors, such as SESTRINs (SESNs) and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS), which transmit intracellular leucine availability toward mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. SESNs negatively regulate mTORC1 by binding and inhibiting GATOR2, an upstream activator of mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Upon leucine stimulation, SESN2 dissociates from GATOR2 resulting in increased mTORC1 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. LRS, an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase that catalyzes the ligation of leucine to its cognate tRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, also exerts a noncanonical role and activates mTORC1 upon leucine binding by functioning as a GAP toward RagD and by ensuring the leucylation of RagA/B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Besides their sensing activities, it is plausible that alterations in protein levels of leucine sensors can impose an additional level of control on mTORC1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. For instance, amino acid starvation and stress upregulate SESN2 protein content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and lead to more SESN2 bound to GATOR2 and thus sustained mTORC1 inhibition. Whether fluctuations in nutrient availability also affect the levels or stability of LRS and whether dynamic changes in LRS content can regulate mTORC1 activity remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par6">De novo protein synthesis is a highly energy consuming process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, while the energy cost of protein breakdown has been estimated to be much lower to even neglectable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Protein synthesis and mTORC1 activity therefore need to be tightly controlled upon metabolic stress such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, to ensure cell survival. Dependent on the specific context, hypoxia either strongly inhibits or promotes mTORC1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Yet, the cellular machinery that ensures cell survival and orchestrates a fast and efficient cellular recovery upon restoration of oxygen and nutrient supply needs to be maintained. An excellent set of candidates to orchestrate such adaptive responses are prolyl-hydroxylase domain proteins 1&#x02013;3 (PHD1&#x02013;3). PHDs belong to a family of enzymes which use oxygen, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, ascorbic acid, and the TCA intermediate &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (&#x003b1;KG) to hydroxylate proline residues in their target substrate proteins, the best characterized ones being the hypoxia-inducible factors 1&#x02013;3&#x003b1; (HIF1&#x02013;3&#x003b1;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. During hypoxia, HIF1&#x003b1; inhibits mTORC1 by activating the transcription its downstream target regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) which has been shown to activate TSC2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. On the other hand, HIF2&#x003b1; increases mTORC1 activity under low amino acid availability by increasing the expression of the LAT1 amino acid carrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Besides controlling HIF stability, PHDs can also change the activity and stability of other proteins, either or not in a hydroxylation dependent fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. But whether PHDs can directly control protein synthesis, is not known.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we show that PHD1 controls the activation of mTORC1 in response to leucine in a hydroxylation-independent manner. PHD1 interacts with and determines the stability of the leucine sensor LRS. This interaction is promoted under conditions of hypoxia and amino acid starvation (when PHD1 activity is inhibited) and protects LRS from degradation. In this way, PHD1 ensures effective activation of mTORC1 in response to leucine. As a consequence, genetic loss of <italic>Phd1</italic> reduces the stability of LRS, impaires leucine mediated activation of mTORC1 and leads to lower muscle mass. The relevance of our data is underscored by the observation that elderly humans have lower PHD1 levels and LRS activity in muscle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>Phd1</italic>-deficient mice have lower muscle mass</title><p id="Par8">To study the role of PHD1 in mTORC1 activation and muscle mass control in vivo we used PHD1<sup>KO</sup> mice (50% Swiss/50% 129S1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Both males (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and females (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>) showed lower mass of both <italic>m. gastrocnemius</italic> (GAS), <italic>m. tibialis anterior</italic> (TA) and <italic>m. extensor digitorum longus</italic> (EDL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis confirmed that PHD1<sup>KO</sup> mice have lower lean mass when compared with the corresponding controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The reduction in lean mass resulted into lower body weight in males but not in females (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>), where the reduction in lean mass was completely compensated by an increase in fat mass (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). This data confirms previous work reporting increased white adipose tissue mass in PHD1<sup>KO</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Based on these observations, we wondered whether the interaction between PHD1 and LRS improves LRS stability and whether LRS stability is enhanced when the interaction is promoted, such as during nutrient and oxygen deprivation. We first performed a cycloheximide chase assay for LRS in WT vs. PHD1<sup>KO</sup> myotubes, and noticed that upon translation elongation inhibition, LRS levels dropped faster when <italic>Phd1</italic> is absent, indicating that loss of <italic>Phd1</italic> reduces LRS protein stability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Second, we found that LRS protein levels remain remarkably stable (or even increase) during short-term amino acid starvation as well as hypoxia in WT myotubes, but rapidly go down in PHD1<sup>KO</sup> myotubes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b, c</xref>) showing that PHD1 is required for the maintenance of LRS stability during oxygen and amino acid deprivation. Altogether, we show that upon metabolic stress, including amino acid starvation and hypoxia when PHD1 enzymatic activity is inhibited, PHD1 interacts with LRS and protects it from degradation in a manner which does not require its enzymatic activity. The protection of LRS during low oxygen and amino acid levels ensures a rapid and efficient activation of mTORC1 as soon as nutrient levels are restored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>PHD1 levels and LRS activity decline during aging</title><p id="Par23">Aging is associated with a loss of muscle mass.

We found that older muscle on average showed an almost 50% decrease in PHD1 levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Lower PHD1 content was confirmed using immunofluorescent stainings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, c</xref>). Importantly, in other cell types PHD1 localizes mainly in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, but several groups have also reported cytosolic localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> and function of PHD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.

LRS levels were also lower but this failed to reach statistical significance because variability between subjects was larger (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).

It is therefore likely that control of mTORC1 oxygen sensitive mechanisms is dependent on the cellular context. Here, we describe that the oxygen sensor PHD1 promotes mTORC1 activation upon leucine stimulation. We found that PHD1 interacts with the leucine sensor LRS and controls LRS stability. This interaction is promoted under conditions of hypoxia and amino acid starvation when PHD1 hydroxylation activity is inhibited and protects LRS from degradation. Consequently, loss of <italic>Phd1</italic> reduces the stability of LRS, impairs leucine-mediated activation of mTORC1 and leads to lower muscle mass in vivo.</p><p id="Par25">We found that PHD1<sup>KO</sup> mice have lower muscle mass, muscle fiber size, and force production. This was not caused by increased muscle proteolysis as we did not find upregulation of atrogenes nor activation of autophagy. Instead, we observed a blunted mTORC1 activation in response to leucine stimulation leading to lower protein synthesis. mTORC1 plays a central role in the regulation of muscle mass: activation of mTORC1 induces muscle hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, whereas skeletal muscle specific inactivation results in low muscle mass coinciding with dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the fact that sustained activation of mTORC1 in muscle also induces myopathy characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, indicates that mTORC1 activity should be tightly controlled in order to prevent muscle dysfunction. We did not find any evidence for muscle dystrophy or myopathy, showing that the ability of PHD1 to control mTORC1 activity is modest, and is restricted to modulating upstream anabolic events that activate mTORC1. Several anabolic signals such as leucine, growth factors, but also eccentric contractions are potent regulators of mTORC1 in muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. The activation of mTORC1 in response to growth factors (such as insulin) as well as contractions was however preserved in PHD1<sup>KO</sup> mice. Instead, there was a selective &#x0201c;resistance&#x0201d; of PHD1<sup>KO</sup> muscle toward leucine, showing that PHD1 controls mTORC1 via events upstream of mTORC1 which are specifically linked to the sensing and transmission of amino acid signals.</p><p id="Par26">Ample literature has shown the contribution of LRS and SESNs to leucine sensing in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, their functional role as leucine sensors in vivo in tissues such as skeletal muscle, has been questioned since the Kd dissociation constant for leucine of both SESN2 and LRS is approximately tenfold lower than the leucine concentration observed in skeletal muscle of humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. This implies that both enzymes are completely saturated at physiological leucine concentrations and has led to the suggestion that alterations in protein levels of leucine sensors impose an additional level of control in modulating mTORC1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. On the other hand, in vitro experiments in HEK293T cells demonstrated that leucylation of RagA, considered as a readout of LRS activity, increases in an almost linear manner with leucine doses up to 30-fold of the normal physiological values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, the exact mechanisms through which leucine sensors control mTORC1 still remain to be fully elucidated. We show here that altering LRS levels suffices to increase leucine mediated mTORC1 activation in myotubes. Moreover, we found decreased LRS levels and lower leucylation of RagA (RagA K<sub>Leu</sub>142) in PHD1<sup>KO</sup> animals, showing that LRS protein levels and LRS activity can be modulated in vivo to/and control mTORC1 activation.</p><p id="Par27">It has been reported that LRS levels remain stable during amino acid starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. This is in agreement with our data. In addition, we show that PHD1 is required to maintain LRS protein stability during conditions of oxygen and amino acid deprivation. The increased stability of LRS is in sharp contrast to most amino acid tRNA synthetases, which are rapidly degraded during amino acid starvation induced autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that the maintenance of LRS protein levels may not be related to its role as a tRNA synthetase but with other noncanonical LRS functions. Instead, keeping LRS levels high during episodes of low oxygen and/or amino acid availability may allow the cell to ensure a fast and efficient reactivation of mTORC1 as soon as oxygen and nutrient levels are restored. Our data also shows active modulation of LRS levels by metabolism.</p><p id="Par28">We did not observe differences in SESN1&#x02013;2 protein content upon loss of <italic>Phd1</italic>, nor did we observe a rescue of leucine mediated mTORC1 activation upon knockdown of SESN1&#x02013;2 in PHD1<sup>KO</sup> cells.

Preserved activation of mTORC1 by insulin (acting via TSC2) as well as contractions (acting via TSC2 or RAPTOR directly) strongly argues against involvement of TSC2 or RAPTOR itself.

Indeed, DMOG treatment of amino acid starved MEFs did not result into accumulation of HIF1&#x003b1; or an increase in HIF transcriptional activity. In addition, DMOG treatment also prevented mTORC1 activation in both TSC2 knockout MEFs, suggesting that PHDs act through the Rag GTPases.</p><p id="Par31">The ability of PHD1 to ensure mTORC1 activity upon leucine stimulation was independent of its hydroxylation activity, since reintroduction of the catalytic dead PHD1 in PHD1<sup>KO</sup> myotubes completely restored mTORC1 activity. Second, we found that PHD1 interacted with LRS and this interaction also did not require PHD1 hydroxylation activity because the enzymatic dead mutant PHD1 also interacted with LRS. Due to different levels of overexpression for wild type vs. mutant PHD1 within our immunoprecipitation experiments, it is difficult to make a clear statement on whether inhibition of the enzymatic activity of PHD1 suffices to actively promote the interaction or whether other unknown processes are involved. Nonetheless, we found that reducing PHD activity by using DMOG as well as amino acid starvation increased the interaction with LRS and preserved LRS stability in WT cells. Consequently, loss of <italic>Phd1</italic>&#x000a0;prevented LRS stabilization under conditions of amino acid and oxygen shortage, and resulted into a rapid decline of LRS protein levels. The detailed mechanisms underlying this improved interaction require further investigation. Indeed, our data does not allow us to conclude that the interaction between LRS and PHD1 is actively promoted when PHD1 hydroxylation activity is inhibited. An alternative explanation could be that reduced interaction of PHD1 with its canonical target HIF during hypoxia increases the availability of PHD1 to interact with other substrates. Nonetheless, similar observations were made in breast cancer cells were the interaction between PHD1 and NRF1/PGC1&#x003b1; to preserve mitochondrial function during tumor growth was enhanced during hypoxia and was also independent of PHD1&#x02019;s hydroxylation activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Our findings show that PHDs can exert different functions during normoxia/nutrient availability when they hydroxylate HIFs (and potentially other targets) vs. hypoxia/nutrient depletion when they execute an autonomous role within the hypoxia-dependent program.</p><p id="Par32">Altogether, PHD1 integrates oxygen and nutrient availability to modulate the activation of mTORC1 in response to leucine. The in vivo relevance of our data is underscored by the lower muscle mass of PHD1<sup>KO</sup> animals. Moreover, we observed that PHD1 levels and LRS activity are lower in muscle of elderly with anabolic resistance. To the best of our knowledge, we did not find any report showing reduced PHD1 levels in aging muscle. The upstream mediators of altered PHD1 levels during aging are not known and warrant further research. But since we show that modulating PHD1/LRS levels can alter the muscular response to leucine, our data raises the question whether PHD1/LRS levels could be therapeutically targeted to improve the anabolic effect of leucine and to prevent the development of age-related sarcopenia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Reagents and cell culture</title><p id="Par33">HEK293T cells (DSMZ, ACC 635) were maintained in DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific; 41966052) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher Scientific, 10270-106).

Phd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were generated using homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The targeting vector was built in a pPNTlox2 plasmid with loxP sites flanking the neomycine resistance (neor) cassette, and contained from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;: a 5.3-kb EcoRV-HindIII fragment comprising exon 2 and the majority of intron 2 as 5&#x02032; homology arm, a 1.8-kb floxed neor cassette, a 2.5-kb HindIII-EcoRV fragment comprising exon 3 through 6, in which a third loxP site was introduced downstream of exon 4 along with a novel EcoRI site for genotyping purposes, an SV40 thymidine kinase expression cassette for negative selection purposes. The introduced third loxP site together with the loxP site located 3&#x02032; of the neor cassette thus flanked the Phd1 gene segment comprising exon 3 and 4, which encode part of the catalytic domain conferring the prolyl hydroxylase activity. The construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into G4 ES cells of 129SvEv/C57BL6 origin (kind gift from A. Nagy, Toronto)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

Correctly targeted ES cells were then transiently electroporated with the pOG231 Cre-recombinase expressing plasmid to excise the floxed neor cassette. Clones with exclusive excision of the neor cassette and retention of the floxed genomic fragment, were identified by PCR and Southern blot screens based on the retention of the newly introduced EcoRI site.
