The cross-linking of uS19 to the A site codon has been detected using synthetic mRNAs bearing 4-thiouridine (s<sup>4</sup>U) residues. Here, we showed that the A-site tRNA prevents this cross-linking and that the P site codon does not contact uS19. Next, we focused on determining uS19-mRNA interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> by applying the photoactivatable-ribonucleoside enhancing cross-linking and immunoprecipitation method to a stable HEK293 cell line producing FLAG-tagged uS19 and grown in a medium containing s<sup>4</sup>U. We found that when translation was stopped by cycloheximide, uS19 was efficiently cross-linked to mRNA regions with a high frequency of Glu, Lys and, more rarely, Arg codons. The results indicate that the complexes, in which the A site codon is not involved in the formation of the mRNA-tRNA duplex, are present among the cycloheximide-arrested 80S complexes, which implies pausing of elongating ribosomes at the above mRNA regions. Thus, our findings demonstrate that the human ribosomal protein uS19 interacts with mRNAs during translation elongation and highlight the regions of mRNAs where ribosome pausing occurs, bringing new structural and functional insights into eukaryotic translation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Russian Foundation for Basic Research</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100002261</named-content></funding-source><award-id>17-04-00609</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Russian state funded budget of ICBFM SB RAS</named-content></funding-source><award-id>&#x00410;&#x00410;&#x00410;&#x00410;-&#x00410;17-117020210022-4</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Russian Ministry of Science and Higher Education</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The final stage of the implementation of genetic information is the synthesis of proteins, one of the most important cellular processes. In all kingdoms of life, this process occurs on ribosomes, where the information, copied from DNA and encoded as trinucleotide (codon) sequences in mRNAs, is translated into the amino acid sequences of the synthesized proteins. The interaction of the ribosome with mRNA and tRNA, which occurs with the help of auxiliary protein factors, is a central event at all stages of translation. Currently, the structural organization of key functional centers of ribosomes, including the mRNA binding channel, where codon-anticodon interactions take place, is well known. Remarkably, rRNA nucleotides involved in the formation of this channel on the small subunit form a conserved core, which is structurally identical in bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes (reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)). In addition, some conservative features of the mRNA channel are provided by the ribosomal proteins uS3, uS7, uS11 and uS12 (reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)). However, with all this, there are also significant differences in the protein environments of mRNAs on bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes. These differences relate to the participation of ribosomal proteins eS30, eS26 and eS28, which do not have bacterial homologues, as well as the eukaryote/archaea-specific extension of the uS19 protein in the formation of the mRNA binding channel of eukaryotic ribosomes (reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)). It should be noted that ribosomal proteins are named here according to the nomenclature proposed in (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The protein uS19 (previously named S15 (see <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)) has first been identified as a component of the decoding site of mammalian ribosomes by affinity cross-linking using mRNA analogues containing the 4-thiouridine (s<sup>4</sup>U) residue at a certain position (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>). In these reports, the contact of the 19 kDa ribosomal protein with the s<sup>4</sup>U residue at any position of the A-site codon has been shown in the absence of a ligand at the A site. A little later, the data that uS19 is a characteristic component of the ribosomal decoding site, have also been obtained using mRNA analogues carrying a photoactivatable aryl azide group at the nucleotide in a definite position (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>). After some time, the participation of uS19 in the formation of the decoding center of mammalian ribosomes has again been confirmed by means of the same approach using synthetic mRNAs containing the s<sup>4</sup>U residue at a certain location (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) as well as mRNA analogues with oxidized 3&#x02032;-terminal ribose (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In addition, studies on the cross-linking of human ribosomes to mRNA analogues have revealed that the protein eS30 is also a component of the decoding site (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). According to cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the expanded and poorly structured eS30 interacts with the A site region through its N-terminal fragment. This part of eS30 has been shown to cross-link to an mRNA analogue with oxidized 3&#x02032;-terminal ribose at position +7 relative to the first nucleotide of the P site-bound codon (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As for uS19, using the cross-linking of human ribosomes to photoactivatable mRNA analogues followed by site-directed cleavage of cross-linked uS19 with proteolytic agents, it has been found that the C-terminal unstructured tail of the protein, namely its fragment 131&#x02013;145, is involved in the interaction with the nucleotide bases of the A site codon (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Much later, the C-terminal tail of uS19 has been localized in the 40S ribosomal decoding area using cryo-EM, and some assumptions about interactions of this protein with mRNA and tRNA have been made (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In particular, it has been suggested that the uS19 tail interacts with the A and P site tRNA anticodon stem-loops rather than with mRNAs, without taking into account the data of numerous cross-linking studies mentioned above, which had clearly demonstrated that this tail interacts with the A site mRNA codon. Moreover, according to these studies, the uS19 tail is able to interact with the A site codon in various types of ribosomal complexes that correspond to different translation steps, from the start codon recognition up to the appearance of a stop codon at the A site (reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)). In addition, it has been shown that the appearance of a ligand at the A site can completely block the cross-linking of an mRNA analogue to uS19. In particular, the binding of eRF1 interferes with the cross-linking of uS19 to a synthetic mRNA containing the s<sup>4</sup>U residue in the stop codon (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref>), and tRNA prevents the interaction of the protein with an mRNA analogue with 3&#x02032;-oxidized ribose (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Now, it has become possible to find out whether the ribosomal protein uS19 is indeed involved in the translation process, using the photoactivatable-ribonucleoside enhancing cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) approach, which allows the transcriptome-wide determination of RNA binding protein interaction sites. In this study, we applied the PAR-CLIP method to a specially designed stable cell line, inducibly producing human ribosomal protein uS19 with an N-terminal FLAG-tag (<sup>FLAG</sup>uS19), which was able to functionally replace the endogenous uS19 in the ribosomes. RNA-protein cross-links were generated in the cells that were grown in a medium containing s<sup>4</sup>U and treated with cycloheximide that binds to the ribosome in the E site pocket on the large subunit and thereby blocks the translocation of tRNA from the P site to the E site (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Therefore, in the cycloheximide-arrested ribosomes, the A site should be occupied by peptidyl-tRNA, which could protect uS19 from cross-linking to the mRNA codon containing the s<sup>4</sup>U residue in accordance with the above data on shielding the protein by the A-site-bound ligand. However, given the possible pausing of ribosomes during translation elongation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), we expected that this treatment would lead to the appearance of complexes with different peptidyl-tRNA states, including those, in which the A site codon did not participate in the formation of the mRNA-tRNA duplex and could interact with <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of cDNA libraries derived from cross-linked RNA fragments revealed several hundreds of the clusters of sequencing reads with characteristic T/C transitions indicating, according to (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), s<sup>4</sup>U-dependent cross-linking of cellular RNAs to <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19. To correctly interpret the PAR-CLIP results, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments on cross-linking human ribosomes to mRNA analogues containing s<sup>4</sup>U residues, which confirmed that interaction with uS19 is indeed a characteristic feature of the A site mRNA codon and that the A site tRNA interferes with this interaction. Mapping the positions of T/C transitions to the human genome showed that detected read clusters correspond to coding sequence (CDS) regions of mRNAs with a high frequency of Glu, Lys and, more rarely, Arg codons. This meant that the ribosomes were already paused at these regions before the translation was stopped by cycloheximide, and that the A site codon was not involved in the formation of the mRNA-tRNA duplex in the paused ribosomes, which allowed this codon to cross-link to <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 if it contained the s<sup>4</sup>U residue. Thus, the obtained results revealed previously unknown features of the translation elongation process in mammalian cells, demonstrating the involvement of the ribosomal protein uS19 in maintaining the proper location of the mRNA codon at the decoding site and displaying mRNA regions, the reading of which causes ribosome pausing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Affinity cross-linking of s<sup>4</sup>U-containing mRNA analogues to human ribosomes</title><p>Human ribosomal 40S and 60S subunits were isolated from full term placenta, as described in (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).

When designing sequences of the mRNAs, we took into account that the s<sup>4</sup>U residue in the second position of the P site codon does not form cross-links with uS19, unlike the one located in the same position of the A site codon (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Thus, in the resulting ribosome complexes with the mRNAs, the s<sup>4</sup>U residue was either at positions +2 or +3 (complex 1), or positions +5 or +6 (complexes 2&#x02013;6) relative to the first nucleotide of the P site-bound codon, which corresponds to the location of the s<sup>4</sup>U-containing triplet at the P or A site, respectively. In complexes 1&#x02013;3 and 6, the A site was empty, and in complexes 4&#x02013;5 it was occupied by tRNA cognate to the codon bound there. All mRNAs used were able to efficiently bind to ribosomes in the presence of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> or tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, which directed the cognate codon to the P site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>, left panel). Analysis of proteins isolated from irradiated complex 1&#x02013;6 showed that the cross-linking patterns generated by mRNA I-IV contain the ones similar to those observed for the respective binary mixtures, where the mRNAs were not fixed on the ribosomes by the codon-anticodon interaction at the mRNA-binding channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, right panels). These common patterns correspond to the uS3 and eS30 proteins cross-linked to mRNA I&#x02013;IV through specific structural motifs lying outside the 40S subunit channel, which are known to cross-link to mRNA analogues loosely coupled to ribosomes in the absence of tRNA (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The appearance of cross-linked uS3 and eS30 in all the patterns in not surprising, since labile binary complexes of mRNA analogues with ribosomes are usually present in the corresponding reaction mixtures, along with those in which the mRNA analogue is fixed in the channel (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>As expected, in complexes 2, 3 and 6, uS19 was cross-linked to the s<sup>4</sup>U residue at positions +5 or +6, unlike complex 1, where cross-linking to uS19 did not occur. The levels of cross-linking of mRNAs II and III to uS19 in complexes 4 and 5 were reduced by more than 40% compared to those in complexes 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>, right panel), which indicates the shielding effect of the A site tRNA. This value becomes even higher if we take into account that in complexes 4 and 5, up to a third of 80S ribosomes can have the empty A-site, as follows from a comparison of the isotherms of tRNA binding in the A and P sites (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A and B</xref>). It is noteworthy that the cross-linking patterns obtained for complexes 2 and 3 with mRNAs II and III, respectively, rich in purine bases, were identical to that for similar complex 6 with mRNA IV rich in pyrimidine ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B and C</xref>), indicating that the nucleotide context around the A site codon does not affect its contact with uS19. Thus, we conclude that uS19 is a specific target for the s<sup>4</sup>U residue at any position of the A site codon, which is unattainable for the one at the third position of the P site codon, and that uS19 becomes significantly less accessible for the cross-linking if the A site codon is involved in interaction with a cognate tRNA.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>Characterization of the used stable cell line and in-cell RNA cross-linking</title><p>To study the contacts of human ribosomal protein uS19 with translated mRNAs using the PAR-CLIP method, we designed an appropriate stably transfected cell line based on HEK293 cells.

Mapping of sequencing reads to the human genome showed that they were mainly grouped into specific clusters. Many reads in these clusters contained characteristic T/C transitions, which are usually introduced by reverse transcriptase when it meets cross-linked s<sup>4</sup>U residues (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A cluster was considered as corresponding to a <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 cross-linking region in mRNA, if overlapping sequencing reads within it covered at least one position with the T/C transition (or the A/G one for the genes located on the minus DNA strand). In addition, it was taken into account that (i) one T position was covered by at least two reads with T/C transitions, (ii) the total read coverage by the T/C transitions was&#x000a0;&#x02265;5&#x000a0;and (iii) the total T/C transition frequency was more than 1%. Given all this, we mapped to the human genome 2256 and 565 T/C transition positions corresponding to the upper and lower groups of RNA fragments cross-linked to <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), respectively. Since these sets of T/C transition positions overlapped with each other by 440 positions, and correlation in the read coverage per peak with transitions between them was high (<italic>r</italic> = 0.859) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B and C</xref>), we combined the datasets obtained with the cDNA libraries for the upper and lower groups of RNA fragments. As the result, read clusters with T/C transitions were assigned to 580 unique protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</xref>), where they almost completely fell into the regions corresponding to the CDSs of mRNAs transcribed from these genes, which could cross-link to <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 only when they were in the ribosomal mRNA-binding channel. As a rule, the above clusters covered only certain parts of the CDSs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). The length of these parts was different and could be up to several hundred nucleotides, although most of them were 30&#x02013;100 nt long (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). It should be noted that, when mapped to CDSs of mRNAs, the read clusters obtained in the PAR-CLIP experiment mainly overlap with those obtained in the ribosome profiling one, but the latter are distributed over all CDS lengths, whereas the former are located only in some regions of CDSs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6, and S2C and D</xref>, the bottom panels).

Inspection of the nucleotide sequences in gene regions covered with reads containing T/C transitions showed that these sequences were enriched in residues G and A in the parts located both before and after the T/C transition positions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Moreover, this tendency was most pronounced for the gene regions revealed for the first hundred clusters with the highest read coverage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This implied that <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 cross-linking occurred only to G/A-rich regions in CDSs of mRNAs. It should be noted that read clusters mainly fell only into those gene regions, where T residues were present and their positions precisely matched the T/C transition ones, and were practically not detected in regions that did not contain T residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), confirming that <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 cross-linking to mRNAs was indeed s<sup>4</sup>U-dependent.

Considering the peptide motif (E/K)<sub>12</sub> as a reference, we extracted all human proteins with such motifs from the Ensembl database. Since the codons for Glu and Lys do not have a U residue and, therefore, are not able to cross-link to <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 in s<sup>4</sup>U-treated cells, when extracting the above proteins, we allowed up to 4 random substitutions in the motif (E/K)<sub>12</sub> sequence, so that it could include an amino acid whose codon comprises a U residue. The list of genes corresponding to the amino acid sequences derived in this way was then restricted to those that were among the top 1000 of genes with the highest read coverage, which have been identified using Ribo-seq data from HEK293 cells (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).

However, these clusters did not meet the criteria used to be selected as those that matched the cross-linked regions of mRNAs, because of either low read coverage or an insufficient number of T/C transitions, or the lack of appropriate T residues. Obviously, the incomplete correspondence between the compared sets of genes was due to strict criteria for the selection of clusters with T/C transitions and the simplicity of the chosen reference sequence. Therefore, <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 cross-linking to the s<sup>4</sup>U-containing codons within mRNA regions with a high frequency of Glu and Lys/Arg ones did not depend on the sequences of particular mRNAs, and was predetermined by the nature of the amino acid residues encoded by these regions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, the interaction of cellular mRNAs with the ribosomal protein uS19, whose C-terminal tail is known to be located at the decoding site of the 80S ribosome, was first unraveled at the translatome level using the PAR-CLIP method applied to a stable <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19-producing cell line. Our findings, based on the analysis of NGS-derived data, showed that in human ribosomes stalled by cycloheximide, <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 efficiently cross-linked to mRNA regions with a high G/A content encoding amino acid residues Glu, Lys and, more rarely, Arg, without forming cross-links to any other regions.</p><p>As is known, the distinctive features of the above amino acid residues are their charge and bulkiness, and therefore a large number of these residues in the nascent polypeptide can interfere with its movement through the ribosomal tunnel, which starts at the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). One of the functions of this tunnel is to ensure the unhindered exit of the newly synthesized polypeptide chain from the ribosome. At the same time, the data gained with bacterial ribosomes have shown that the tunnel walls, which are formed mainly by nucleotide residues of the large subunit rRNA (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), are involved in monitoring the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide passing along them (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Moreover, the moving polypeptide can interact with the tunnel walls, which results in ribosome pausing at the respective mRNA region during translation elongation (reviewed in (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>)). In addition, using a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free protein-synthesizing translation system, it has been found that chains of positively charged Arg and Lys residues, while in the ribosomal tunnel, could modulate the rate of translation elongation, leading to temporarily arrested ribosomes (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>All of the above allowed us to conclude that when <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19-producing cells were treated with cycloheximide, some portion of the translating ribosomes was already paused at G/A-enriched regions in mRNA CDSs, which were identified as cross-linked to <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19. Hence, as expected, cycloheximide-arrested ribosomes were different types of complexes, including those, in which the A site codon was not involved in the formation of the mRNA-tRNA duplex and was accessible for interaction with <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19. It should be noted that in the aforementioned study (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) for the chain of negatively charged Glu residues, unlike those of Arg and Lys residues, no stopping of the ribosome has been observed. Therefore, one can assume that ribosome pausing detected in the current study is a consequence of a decrease in the rate of translation elongation due to the alternation of side chains of negatively charged Glu residues with those of positively charged Lys/Arg ones in the nascent polypeptide. During translocation of peptidyl-tRNA, the alternation of the above residues might significantly complicate the passage of the peptidyl moiety from the A site to the P site on the large subunit. Accordingly, the state of peptidyl-tRNA in the paused ribosomes might be characterized as a hybrid P/A one. Alternatively, peptidyl-tRNA might be in the P/P-state, but rearrangements in PTC caused by the interaction of the ribosomal tunnel with a moving peptide did not allow aminoacyl-tRNA to enter the A site, and, as a result, a codon located at the decoding site was accessible for contact with the uS19 tail. The possibility of such rearrangements has been shown in cryo-EM studies of the structure of bacterial 70S paused ribosomes obtained using mRNAs encoding specific peptides that caused the arrest of translation (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The lack of <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19 cross-linking sites in mRNA regions other than those mentioned above could be due to the shielding effect of peptidyl-tRNA, which was in the hybrid A/P state (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) in the remaining cycloheximide-arrested ribosomes, similar to the effect observed in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments on cross-linking of mRNAs II and III to human 80S ribosomes.</p><p>Thus, based on the obtained PAR-CLIP data, one can conclude that the mRNA codon entering the ribosomal A site interacts with the C-terminal tail of uS19 through its nucleotide base and that this tail becomes poorly accessible for this interaction at the subsequent stages of the elongation cycle when the A site is occupied by aminoacyl- or peptidyl-tRNA. However, experiments to examine the effect of the A-site tRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> show that it only partially protects uS19 from cross-linking to the A-site s<sup>4</sup>U-containing codon. The disagreement between the protective effects of the A site tRNA observed in the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation system and the &#x02018;non-enzymatic&#x02019; one is likely related to different binding ways of tRNA molecules in the ribosomal A site <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the latter case, the cognate tRNA binds at the A site in a codon-dependent manner directly, without the initial recognition and accommodation steps required in a real translation system when aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered to the ribosome in the complex with eEF-1 and GTP. Accordingly, tRNA bound at the A site &#x02018;non-enzymatically&#x02019; should be in equilibrium with free unbound tRNA, which was taken in excess over ribosomes to provide a higher level of the binding. Therefore, during irradiation, uS19 could cross-link to the s<sup>4</sup>U-containing mRNA codon at the time when one tRNA was already dissociated from the A site and the other did not yet bind there. In contrast, in the <italic>in vivo</italic> translation system, the tRNA molecule bound at the A site cannot leave this site before transpeptidation and the subsequent translocation of the resulting peptidyl-tRNA from the A to the P site, which allows it to completely block the cross-linking of the s<sup>4</sup>U-containing codon located at the A site to uS19.</p><p>Why does the ribosomal protein uS19 interact with mRNA at the decoding site during translation elongation? Considering that the uS19 tail is in contact with a stop codon in the pre-termination complex (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), one can suppose that the functional assignment of the occurrence of this tail in the decoding site is to ensure the proper location of the A site codon when it is recognized by cognate aminoacyl-tRNA or eRF1. The N-terminal fragment of the ribosomal protein eS30 most likely assists the uS19 tail in maintaining the A site codon conformation necessary for recognition, since it is also located in the decoding site (see Introduction) and its interaction with the A site codon is completely blocked by an A site-bound ligand (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this regard, it is obvious that results similar to those obtained with <sup>FLAG</sup>uS19-producing cells could be gained by applying the PAR-CLIP method to <sup>FLAG</sup>eS30-producing ones. However, so far we have no data to judge to which extent the interactions of these proteins with mRNAs are important for the decoding process and what happens if they do not occur. Determining whether the interactions of the C-terminal tail of uS19 and the N-terminal fragment of eS30 with mRNAs at the ribosomal decoding site are critical for elongation may be the next step in the investigation of the involvement of human ribosomal proteins in the translation process.</p><p>In general, the results of this study clearly show that the C-terminal tail of uS19 directly interacts with cellular mRNAs at the ribosomal A site. Since this interaction occurs only if the A site codon does not participate in the formation of the mRNA-tRNA duplex, the regions of cellular mRNAs involved in interaction with uS19 are actually those, at which ribosomes pause during translation elongation because of their inability to bind aminoacyl-tRNAs. These regions include sequences encoding protein portions rich in the amino acid residues Glu, Lys and Arg, which interfere with the movement of the growing polypeptide through the ribosomal tunnel. Thus, our findings shed light on previously unknown features of translation elongation in mammalian cells, allowing a fresh look at this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The read data reported in this study were deposited in the GEO under the accession number GSE128265.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1145_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="gkz1145_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors are grateful to SB RAS Genomics Core Facility for the sequencing.</p></ack><sec id="SEC6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>
