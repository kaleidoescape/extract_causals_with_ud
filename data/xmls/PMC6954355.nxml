However, applications of proteins are limited due to some of their properties such as solubility. Protein hydrolysis is a widespread strategy to improve their chemical, functional, and nutritional properties.<xref rid="b1-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> During the hydrolysis, proteins are broken into small peptides and amino acids. Because the enzymatic hydrolysis is performed in relatively mild conditions and no amino acid damage occurs, this kind of hydrolysis is preferred to acidic and alkaline hydrolysis.<xref rid="b2-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>Because of the potential applications of bioactive peptides in functional foods production, these compounds have great importance and application in human nutrition and health. Bioactive peptides from various food proteins can be used as natural substitutes for most expensive chemical medicines that are usually used for chronic diseases.<xref rid="b2-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Hydrolysed proteins showed antioxidative activity and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibiting effect which depended on the type of enzyme and was increased with increase in the hydrolysis time.<xref rid="b3-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As synthesized anti-hypertensive drugs have been reported to exhibit several undesirable side effects or other health complications following long-term administration, food-derived ACE inhibitory peptides are considered to be safer in combating hypertension.<xref rid="b4-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, many researchers have searched for natural sources of ACE inhibitors in the past decade. Recent studies on proteins and bioactive peptides with the aim to improve human health and prevent chronic diseases have led to further investigations about these bioactive peptides. Rayaprolu et al. purified and characterized bioactive peptides from soybean for cancer cell proliferation inhibition.<xref rid="b5-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Lee et al. investigated the antioxidant and anticancer effects of functional peptides obtained from ovotransferrin hydrolysates.<xref rid="b6-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Ghassem et al. identified two novel antioxidant peptides obtained from protein hydrolysates obtained from the Edible-nest Swiftlet (Aerodramus fuciphagus).<xref rid="b7-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>Results of scientific literature show that bioactive peptides obtained from plant proteins through enzymatic hydrolysis have suitable functional properties such as emulsifying and foaming capacities (e.g., functional properties of soybean),<xref rid="b8-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> water and oil absorption, and outstanding health improving functions such as high antioxidant activity (peptides from soybean, black wheat, cotton seed, sunflower seed, peanut, and pumpkin),<xref rid="b9-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> cholesterol reduction (fish hydrolysates),<xref rid="b10-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> antimicrobial activity (peptides from cereals, legumes, and mushrooms),<xref rid="b11-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> antihypertensive activity (peptides from wheat, soybean, rice, and azufrado beans),<xref rid="b12-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and metal chelating ability (peptides from collagen).<xref rid="b13-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Takenaka et al. studied the antioxidant activity of soybean protein and its hydrolysats. They found that a diet containing 20% soybean protein and its hydrolysates has a preventive effect on thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in rats, and peptides obtained from soybean hydrolysis can decrease blood cholesterol more than non-hydrolyzed soybean proteins.<xref rid="b14-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Lahart et al. investigated reasons for the prevention of oxidative processes in the presence of bioactive peptides and concluded that this preventive effect could be due to the metal chelating activity of peptides or some certain groups in their amino acid side chains that preferably bind with free radicals in fatty acids and prevent the oxidation process.<xref rid="b15-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Klompong et al. studied the protein hydrolysates of yellowstripe scad (Selaroides leptolepis) obtained through hydrolysis using alcalase and flavourzyme, and suggested that these hydrolysates have proper functional properties.<xref rid="b16-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> During hydrolysis by both of the enzymes, protein solubility increased more than 85%, and interfacial activity (emulsifying, and foaming capacities and stabilities) of the hydrolysates was dependent upon the degree of hydrolysis and type of protease.</p><p>Pumpkin is of the Cucurbitaceae, and in this family, medicinal pumpkin seed (Cucurbita pepo) has the highest diversity. A large amount of oil products are obtained from plant resources each year. medicinal pumpkin seed with 23-35% protein and 20-55% oil is a rich source of protein and oil. Pumpkin seed oil contains high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid and oleic acid. Thus, pumpkin seed is an appropriate source for various industries.<xref rid="b17-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The issue at hand is the amount of remaining wastes that mostly consist of pumpkin meal. Disposing of this amount of wastes is not cost-effective and causes environmental problems, and these wastes have nutritional and medicinal value; thus, they can be used in various processes to decrease waste and produce products with high nutritional values.</p><p>In the present study, enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins of pumpkin meal was carried out using protease enzyme pepsin, and therefore, the best treatment was selected using Design-Expert software (version 6.0.2, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MI, USA) with response surface method (RSM) as optimum treatment for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazy (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. Subsequently, functional properties (emulsifying, foaming, water absorption, and oil absorption capacities), pH and heat stability, and amino acid profile for optimum treatment were investigated and compared to those of pumpkin seed protein isolate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Medicinal pumpkin seed meal (Cucurbita pepo con.

As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ARYA-15-218">figure 1</xref>, hydrolysis has a positive effect on emulsifying capacity. Changes in pH had a significant effect (P &#x0003e; 0.050) on emulsifying capacity, and the lowest and highest emulsifying capacities were observed at a pH of 4 and 10, respectively. As the pH range of most processed foods is 4-10, this range was used for evaluation of the functional properties of protein isolate and concentrate.</p><p>

There was no significant difference in the results (P &#x0003e; 0.0500). This shows that antioxidant activity in peptides after 180 minutes at 100 &#x000b0;C remains approximately unchanged.</p><p>
<bold><italic>pH stability: </italic></bold>Changes in antioxidant activity of pumpkin seed protein hydrolysates with pH variation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ARYA-15-218">figure 3</xref>. There was no significant (P &#x0003e; 0.050) difference in antioxidant activity of samples in different pHs.

<bold><italic>DPPH radical scavenging activity: </italic></bold>The pepsin ezyme can hydrolyze peptide bounds next to leucine and aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine), and it has been acknowledged that the terminal phenyl group in the resultant peptide chain has free radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, it has been recognized that proteins&#x02019; denaturation and loss of natural structure through hydrolysis leads to unfolding and exposure of active amino acids that can react with free radicals. There is a direct relation between free radical scavenging and hydrogen donating of amino acids.

<bold><italic>Emulsifying capacity of pumpkin seed protein isolate and hydrolysate: </italic></bold>The emulsifying mechanism of protein hydrolysate samples is defined as their adsorption of oil droplets, covering them, and prevention of their association after homogenization.<xref rid="b30-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> As emulsifying capacity is dependent upon the degree of hydrophobicity and molecular weight of hydrolysates, samples with hydrophobic amino acids and longer chain have higher emulsifying capacity.<xref rid="b30-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> During hydrolysis, the solubility of hydrolysates increases, and they migrate to the water-oil interface.<xref rid="b27-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</p><p>As protein hydrolysates contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic sequences that are necessary for interfacial properties, these components are considered as surface active agents.<xref rid="b30-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> During hydrolysis, the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic sequences of hydrolysates leads to an increase in the emulsifying capacity of hydrolysates.<xref rid="b31-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Emulsifying capacity at the pH of 4 can be related to the lower solubility of protein near the isoelectric point, while the increase in emulsifying capacity of the sample by increasing the pH could be related to negative charges association that not only causes electrostatic repulsion, but also increases the flexibility of protein and facilitates its propagation through the water-oil interface.<xref rid="b31-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</p><p>
<bold><italic>Foaming capacity of pumpkin seed protein isolate and hydrolyste: </italic></bold>Because of their high interfacial activity, proteins are responsible for foaming in flours. Soluble proteins can reduce the surface tension in the fluid-air interface and prevent the association of bubbles. Moreover, protein molecules can unfold, react with each other, and form a multilayer protein film that leads to higher flexibility in the water-air interface; consequently, breaking the bubbles becomes difficult and firm foam is formed.<xref rid="b24-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p><p>To show the foaming capacity, proteins have to easily disperse in water, readily migrate to the interface, and easily unfold to form a layer around the air/gas bubbles.<xref rid="b27-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Protein flexibility, presence of hydrophobic amino acids, and reduced surface tension are factors that influence foaming properties.<xref rid="b16-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The observed increase in foaming capacity of pumpkin seed hydrolysates compared to that of protein isolate might be related to the increase in solubility of hydrolysates due to enzymatic hydrolysis. Klompong et al. studied the enzymatic hydrolysis of yellowstripe scad by alcalase and flavourzyme in different degrees of hydrolysis (5%, 15%, and 25%).<xref rid="b16-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> They found that foaming capacity is influenced by type of enzyme and degree of hydrolysis, and increasing the degree of hydrolysis decreases the foaming capacity.<xref rid="b16-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Increase in foaming capacity due to hydrolysis was also reported by Li et al.<xref rid="b31-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>

<bold><italic>Water absorption capacity of pumpkin seed protein isolate and hydrolysate: </italic></bold>Water absorption capacity has an important role in viscose systems such as soups and prevents water loss in bakery products like cakes.<xref rid="b27-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Water holding capacity is related to the nitrogen solubility index, and higher nitrogen solubility index leads to higher water absorption capacity. As nitrogen solubility increases during hydrolysis,27 hydrolysates have higher water absorption capacity compared to protein isolate.</p><p>Increase in water absorption capacity at a pH of 10 can be related to the increase in repulsion forces due to negative charge in basic pH, and decrease in this capacity can be related to a decrease in solubility around the isoelectric point.<xref rid="b24-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p><p>
<bold><italic>Oil absorption capacity of pumpkin seed protein isolate and hydrolysate: </italic></bold>Generally, oil absorption is strongly affected by both solubility and surface hydrophobicity of protein27 and because of the ability of protein to bridge between water and oil, oil absorption capacity has an important role in some food systems such as meat products, especially sausages.<xref rid="b32-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Oil absorption is a key factor in meat substitutes due to the role of this functional property in the enhancement of flavor and generation of a better mouthfeel.<xref rid="b32-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p><p>
<bold><italic>Heat stability: </italic></bold>The slight change in antioxidant activity of some treatments can be due to the breakdown or aggregation of antioxidant peptides because of the heat. In general, proteins are sensitive to heat, so they aggregate. However, there are reports that smaller hydrolysed proteins are resistant to aggregation in higher temperatures. As this resistance is seen in our samples, these hydrolysates can be used in food processed under heating operations, without significant changes in antioxidant activity. The results of heat stability experiment are similar to those of Nalinanon et al. on fish (Nemipterus hexodon) hydrolysates.<xref rid="b26-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p><p>
<bold><italic>pH stability: </italic></bold>Generally, pumpkin seed protein hedrolysates can exhibit 97-99% of their antioxidant activity in the whole pH range. Nalinanon et al. evaluated the pH stability of peptides from enzymatic hydrolysis of fish (Nemipterus hexodon) muscle by pepsin and reported that radical scavenging activity of peptides was stable at a pH of 1-10, while a slight decrease was observed at a pH of 11. They concluded that antioxidant peptides may be losing some of their activity in higher pHs.<xref rid="b26-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p><p>
<bold><italic>Amino acid analysis: </italic></bold>Generally, pumpkin seed protein hydrolysates are a suitable source of essential amino acids, threonine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, cycteine, and methionine, and sufficient source of isoleucine, valine, and lysine that is the first limiting amino acid. In the non-hydrolyzed protein, glutamic acid, leucine, and aspartic acid were also the main amino acids and lysine was the first limiting amino acid. Similar results have been reported by Zhong et al.<xref rid="b28-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> for the amino acid composition of wheat germ protein and hydrolysate, and Khantaphant et al.<xref rid="b33-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> for stripe red snapper brown fish hydrolysate obtained by alcalase and flavourzyme. In the present study, tryptophan content was not estimated due to its sensitivity and decomposition during hydrolysis. According to Bougatef et al., sensitive amino acids such as methionine and tryptophan are rarely observed after protein hydrolysis.<xref rid="b22-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Amino acid composition has an important role in antioxidant activity of protein hydrolysates. This factor, to a large extent, depends on the type of protease used for the hydrolysis.<xref rid="b34-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Alcalase show high specificity for aromatic (alanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine), acidic (glutamic acid), sulfur containing (methionine), aliphatic (leucine, and isoleusine), hydroxylated (serine), and basic (lysine) amino acids.<xref rid="b35-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> It has been approved that aspartic and glutamic acid,<xref rid="b34-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> in addition to prolamin, arginine, methionine, histidine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, tyrosine, and valine,<xref rid="b36-ARYA-15-218" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> have strong antioxidant activities. According to the amino acid content of pumpkin seed&#x02019;s hydrolysates, it is clear that, in addition to the amount of aspartic acid and glutamic acid, there is also a correlation between antioxidant activities and amount of leucine, Phenylalanine, Threonine and Glycine. Furthermore, the hydrophobic amino acid content of hydrolysated pumpkin seed proteins, which positively correlates with its antioxidant activity, was estimated as 25689 mg/100 g that accounts for 39.85% of total amino acid content of pumpkin seed hydrolysates. According to the amino acid scoring pattern for adults provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, although the tyrosine, histidine, and lysine content of hydrolysated pumpkin seed proteins is less than the suggested amount, it can be a balanced source of essential amino acids (threonine, methionine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine); therefore, it can provide the major amino acids requirement for better health performance, and can be used as dietary supplement in diets contain food protein&#x02019;s deficient in essential amino acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Application of antioxidants is a way of extending the shelf life of high fat foods. Presently, the application of synthetic antioxidants is decreasing due to their chemical nature and risk of being carcinogenic. Bioactive protein hydrolysates obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis are components that can be a good substitution for synthetic antioxidants in foods, and can be used as effective antioxidants and antihypertensive agents in preventing cardiovascular disease. Pumpkin seed protein hydrolysates contain a large amount of hydrophobic amino acids and the high antioxidant activity of these hydrolysates can be related to their hydrophobic sequences. Furthermore, the results showed that enzymatic hydrolysis can improve functional properties such as emulsifying and foaming capacities and water and oil absorption in food formulations like meat and bakery products and some protein food supplements, and thus, improve their physical and chemical properties and extend their shelf life. Pumpkin seed hydrolysates contain essential amino acids (except lysine), so they can be a suitable source of such amino acids according to FAO&#x02019;s amino acid scoring pattern for adults.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The success and outcome of this assignment required much guidance and assistance from many people at the Department of Food Science and Technology, Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran, and we were extremely fortunate to have this throughout our assignment.
