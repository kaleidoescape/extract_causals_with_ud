In addition to deacetylating histones and other proteins, SIRT1/2-mediated regulation is coupled with other epigenetic enzymes. Here, we investigate the links between SIRT1/2 activity and DNA methylation in macrophage differentiation due to their relevance in myeloid cells. SIRT1/2 display drastic upregulation during macrophage differentiation and their inhibition impacts the expression of many inflammation-related genes. In this context, SIRT1/2 inhibition abrogates DNA methylation gains, but does not affect demethylation. Inhibition of hypermethylation occurs at many inflammatory loci, which results in more drastic upregulation of their expression upon macrophage polarization following bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. SIRT1/2-mediated gains of methylation concur with decreases in activating histone marks, and their inhibition revert these histone marks to resemble an open chromatin. Remarkably, specific inhibition of DNA methyltransferases is sufficient to upregulate inflammatory genes that are maintained in a silent state by SIRT1/2. Both SIRT1 and SIRT2 directly interact with DNMT3B, and their binding to proinflammatory genes is lost upon exposure to LPS or through pharmacological inhibition of their activity. In all, we describe a novel role for SIRT1/2 to restrict premature activation of proinflammatory genes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">CERCA</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Innovation and Universities (MCIU)</named-content></funding-source><award-id>SAF2014- 55942-R</award-id><award-id>SAF2017-88086-R</award-id><award-id>AEI/FEDER, UE</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Macrophages (MACs) are required to respond to a wide range of environmental stimuli which specify their functions. Historically classified as both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory, MACs provide versatile and dynamic responses as part of the innate immune system. In order to acquire the corresponding phenotypes of each cell type, MACs undergo very specific changes in gene expression that are mediated by the complex interplay between signalling, transcriptional and epigenetic machineries. Deregulation of these processes results in abnormal MAC function which ultimately forms the basis for many immune diseases.</p><p>Sirtuins, highly conserved proteins that belong to the family of class III histone deacetylases, are key regulators of transcriptional and epigenetic landscape. This family of proteins has been implicated in a wide range of biological and pathological processes, including metabolism, aging and inflammation. One important member of the sirtuin family, SIRT1, regulates inflammation in myeloid cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Originally reported to deacetylate histones H3 and H4, SIRT1 substrates have now been expanded to several transcription factors (TFs), including the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B and p53. SIRT1 also determines the epigenetic landscape through interactions with other chromatin-modifying enzymes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref>). SIRT1 is induced in mature macrophages by anti-inflammatory conditions, such as the exposure to Th2-cytokines and glucocorticoids (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In fact, SIRT1 has been extensively described to be integral to macrophage biology through several distinct mechanisms. For instance, SIRT1 plays a key role in the self-renewal of murine macrophages through cell cycle and longevity pathways (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Also, in a murine model of atherosclerosis, <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment with SIRT1-specific inhibitor EX-527 resulted in increased atherosclerotic lesion size through increased intraplaque macrophage infiltration and impaired autophagy (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Finally, macrophages isolated from SIRT1 transgenic mice exhibited enhanced polarization toward the M2 axis, coupled with decreased expression of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Another member of the sirtuin family, SIRT2, transiently shuttles to the nucleus during G<sub>2</sub>/M transition and shares redundant roles with SIRT1 in the deacetylation of H4K16 and p65 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although less described, SIRT2 also plays a role in macrophage biology, as SIRT2 ameliorates LPS-induced <italic>iNOS</italic> expression in bone marrow macrophages (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and its activities are required for the hypo-inflammation phase of sepsis in a mouse model (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>DNA methylation is another crucial regulator of MAC differentiation, and many key genes have been identified to undergo rapid demethylation during terminal myeloid differentiation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), whereas others undergo slower gains of methylation. In addition, key enzymes in maintaining DNA methylation balance, such as DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and Ten-Eleven-Translocation 2 (TET2), are frequently mutated in myeloid leukaemia (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), reinforcing the importance of DNA methylation in myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, in specific contexts of terminal differentiation, DNMTs are required to yield the final functional phenotype, as such that downregulation of DNMT3A abolishes immune-suppressive properties of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In humans, MACs arise from circulating or resident monocytes (MOs) which are largely present in the blood, spleen and bone marrow. MAC differentiation can be achieved <italic>in vitro</italic> by the addition of M-CSF to isolated peripheral blood MOs. M-CSF MACs can be further polarized into a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotype when exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-4/IL-10 respectively. The plasticity of these MACs render them responsive to further polarization depending on the environmental stimuli encountered, hence they are coined as M0 MACs. Despite the relevance of sirtuins and DNA methylation in myeloid differentiation and function, their interplay has not been explored in this context until now. In the present study, we observed a rapid upregulation of SIRT1/2 proteins upon the addition of M-CSF to MOs to stimulate MAC differentiation, prior to further polarization. We studied the effects of SIRT1/2 inhibition on global gene expression, DNA methylation and changes in various histone marks during macrophage differentiation and activation. In brief, we report a novel role for SIRT1/2 in the sequential and hierarchical deposition of DNA methylation, involving a direct interaction with DNMT3B, and the inhibition of active histone H3 modifications in pro-inflammatory genes to prevent their premature activation during differentiation and prior to the encounter with bacterial antigens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>MO isolation, differentiation and culture</title><p>Buffy coats used in the study were obtained from anonymous donors via the Catalan Blood and Tissue Bank (Banc de Sang i Teixits; BST).

Given that SIRT1/2 participates in macrophage differentiation and their inhibition results in broad changes in gene expression, we investigated their potential interplay with DNA methylation changes. Utilizing high density bead arrays, we observed that 7475 CpGs became demethylated (FDR &#x0003c; 0.05; hypomethylated cluster) upon MAC differentiation from MO, and this demethylation was not affected when SIRT1/2 were inhibited by cambinol, suggesting that they do not participate in active demethylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>, top).

Conversely, 2652 CpGs gained <italic>de novo</italic> methylation (FDR &#x0003c; 0.05; hypermethylated cluster) during MAC differentiation, and surprisingly, inhibition of SIRT1/2 in turn inhibited almost all CpG methylation gains, which suggested that SIRT1/2 activity is required for MAC-associated DNA hypermethylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>, bottom). Analyzing variance between samples using principal component analysis (PCA), we showed that for demethylated CpGs, MACs and cambinol-treated MACs displayed overlapping PC dimensions. In contrast, for hypermethylated CpGs, the three cell populations separated along the axis of PC1, in which cambinol-treated MACs showed less PC1 variance with MOs than MACs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

To evaluate the relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation in relation to SIRT1/2 inhibition, we first mapped the hypermethylated CpGs to the nearest gene, yielding 1612 unique genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

In contrast, majority of genes from the hypermethylated CpG cluster did display a significant change in expression during the MO-to-MAC differentiation step; however, both upregulation and downregulation were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, left panel), which emphasized the complex relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression.

Immunoprecipitation, performed using M-CSF MACs differentiated from MOs for 5 days, showed that both SIRT1 and SIRT2 co-immunoprecipitated with DNMT3B, but not DNMT1 and DNMT3A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Interestingly, DNMT3B and DNMT3A also seemed to interact with each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

Furthermore, the interaction between DNMT3B and SIRT1/2 was not affected by cambinol treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Subsequently, we tested the recruitment of sirtuins to inflammatory loci that become hypermethylated during MAC differentiation in the presence of cambinol in unstimulated and LPS-activated MACs.

Finally, and remarkably, we also observed binding of PU.1 to these genes, in which the pattern of binding of PU.1 was very similar to SIRT1 and 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). We were unable to detect binding of DNMT3A/B to these sequences, however, we could not discard that this was a technical limitation due to the quality of the DNMT antibodies.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>SIRT1 and 2 interact with DNMTs to drive DNA hypermethylation at inflammatory loci.

Thus in order to assess the specific contribution of sirtuins to DNA hypermethylation and expression of inflammatory genes, we downregulated SIRT1 and SIRT2 using siRNAs. We were able to downregulate SIRT1 and SIRT2 with distinct efficiency, achieving 65% and 95% reduction in protein expression respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). We observed that upon SIRT1 knockdown, there was significant inhibition in the acquisition of MO-to-MAC DNA methylation for CpGs annotated to <italic>TNFAIP3</italic>, <italic>JAK3</italic>, <italic>RUNX3</italic>&#x000a0;and <italic>ADORA2A</italic>. Conversely, SIRT2 knockdown did not appear to have an effect on DNA methylation, except in the case of <italic>JAK3</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). Knockdown of either sirtuins did not have an effect on hypomethylated CpGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). Moreover, the inhibition of DNA methylation gain observed in <italic>&#x00394;SIRT1</italic> MACs correlated with an aberrant upregulation of the same genes following LPS stimulation, albeit some did not reach statistical significance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Similar to what was observed with pharmacological inhibitors, SIRT1 downregulation appeared to have stronger impact compared to SIRT2. These observations suggest that SIRT1 is the main player mediating the acquisition of DNA methylation during MAC differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we report a novel role for SIRT1/2 in macrophage differentiation, in which these deacetylases act as a key element in establishing the hierarchy of epigenetic modifications involving acquisition of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation through direct DNMT3B interaction, linked to H3K4me3 demethylation and H3K27ac deacetylation, to prevent premature activation of pro-inflammatory genes during MAC differentiation and prior to encounter with bacterial antigens.&#x000a0;</p><p>Our initial observation showed that both SIRT1 and SIRT2 undergo a drastic upregulation concomitant with MAC differentiation, and that the effects of SIRT1/2 inhibition during this process impact the expression levels of many genes related to the immune properties of these cells, with a particular effect on proinflammatory genes mediating their aberrant upregulation. These observations support a major role of SIRT1/2 in maintaining a repressed status for these genes, most likely through the direction interaction with DNMTs, which is in concordance to what has been observed in other studies. Notably, SIRT1 has been previously described by Park <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> to exert anti-inflammatory effects in RA macrophages through the inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B signalling, and SIRT1 Tg-mice displayed reduced M1 polarization (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Individual siRNA knockdown of SIRT1 and SIRT2 showed that the former mediated loss of DNA methylation and upregulated proinflammatory gene expression while the latter had weaker significant effects. It is therefore likely that SIRT1 is the major contributor to the phenotype of M-CSF macrophages while SIRT2 may offer little or no contribution.</p><p>Interestingly, the analysis of DNA methylation changes in relation to inhibition and downregulation of SIRT1/2 shows that only gains of DNA methylation are affected, in contrast to DNA demethylation, which is identical to those without SIRT1/2 inhibition. Remarkably, the group of genes that gain methylation during macrophage differentiation, almost all of which are affected by SIRT1/2 inhibition, associate with additional epigenetic features including a decrease in H3K27ac and H3K4me3 and an increase in H3K4me1. These observations indicate that these three histone marks are linked to the observed gains of DNA methylation. Different studies have established links between DNA methylation and histone modifications. First, the presence of DNA methylation has originally been described to prevent methylation of H3K4 (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Second, treatment with DNMT inhibitors were shown to increase H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 occupancy at target promoters and gene bodies, as well as resulting in a dramatic increase in enhancer activity (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Furthermore, structural and biochemical studies have shown a direct interaction between the catalytic domain of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferases with unmethylated H3K4 histone peptide leading to the catalytic activation of DNMT3A (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). This interaction was in turn inhibited by H3K4 methylation and histone acetylation (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Taken together, evidence suggests an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and H3K4 methylation. Third, histone remodelers of H3K4 have been linked to DNMT3 recruitment and activity, in which MLL4 enhances DNMT3A-catalyzed DNA methylation at super-enhancers (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and contradictorily LSD1 has been described to function in a complex with DNMT3 to mediate both H3K4 demethylation and DNA methylation at pluripotentency enhancers (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Finally, DNA methylation has been described to inversely correlate with acetylated H3K27 deposition, a classical marker for enhancers (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), however, recent studies also identified bivalent regions, in which H3K27ac co-exists with DNA methylation, although this accounts for a minority of CpGs (38%) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Our findings reinforce the connection between DNA methylation and H3 modifications, in which DNA methylation levels inversely correlate with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), as such that the inhibition of SIRT1/2 mediates higher enrichment of these two histone marks concurrently with a decrease in DNA methylation prior to encounter with bacterial antigen. Furthermore, CpGs that become demethylated upon SIRT1/2 inhibition also gain H4K16ac, which is coherent with the role of SIRT1/2 in its deacetylation. Altogether, these results indicate that the activities of SIRT1/2 are essential in the maintenance of a silent chromatin, defined by DNA hypermethylation and low levels of H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H4K16ac, and their inhibition results in chromatin aperture.</p><p>The dynamics between SIRT1/2 and DNMTs has been partly elucidated by our results, in which we have observed a direct interaction between SIRT1/2 and DNMT3B, which in turn interacts with DNMT3A. Other studies had previously linked SIRT1 activity with DNMTs. For instance, O&#x02019;Hagan <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> showed that SIRT1 recruitment to induced double-strand breaks was dependent on DNMT1, and that DNMT1, DNMT3B and SIRT1 form part of a large multi-protein complex following oxidative DNA damage (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). We observe that the binding of SIRT/DNMT3B complex to chromatin appears to be dependent on SIRT1/2 activity, and it is possible that other transcription factors, such as PU.1, may target the complex to repress pro-inflammatory genes in M0 MACs. Furthermore, the interaction of SIRT1/2 with DNMTs may also participate in the direct deacetylation of these enzymes to modify their activities in a similar way that has been observed for SIRT1 and DNMT3L (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Additionally, SIRT1 has also been indirectly linked to DNA methylation through its activities of modifying histones. One such example was described by Aguilar-Arnal <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> where SIRT1 was observed to directly deacetylate MLL1 and modulate H3K4 tri-methylation along the circadian cycle (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Since H3K4 methylation play concerted roles with DNA methylation, it is therefore plausible that SIRT1 can modulate DNA methylation through histone modifications.</p><p>The hierarchy of DNA methylation, histone modifications and gene expression has been proven to be extremely complex, in which contradictory literature has described DNA methylation as both a cause and a consequence of changes in gene expression. While it is generally accepted that DNA methylation results in gene repression, however, recent studies have provided conflicting evidence in their relationship. One study involving 62 unrelated individuals concluded that DNA methylation contributes to only 8% of inter-individual gene expression variation (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Similarly, another study shows that the presence of DNA methylation is insufficient to transcriptionally repress promoters (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). This conclusion was, however, recently refuted by Korthauer <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, as the authors show that, by utilizing different statistical strategies that include statistical inference of differentially methylated regions and additional normalization techniques, promoter DNA methylation indeed correlate negatively with gene expression (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of DNA methylation during a cell activation event, such as encounter with bacterial antigens, is still unknown. In a study conducted in our laboratory, Vento-Tormo <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> show that a previous demethylation step, together with histone modifications, is required for correct upregulation of inflammatory genes during dendritic cell activation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Contrastingly, a more recent article shows that upregulation of proinflammatory genes precedes DNA demethylation following dendritic cell activation, however, this behavior only accounts for less than 10% of all differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated CpGs (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). In this study, we provide a direct link between DNA methylation, histone modifications and gene expression. We show that SIRT1/2-dependent establishment of correct chromatin state prior to LPS challenge is essential for proper and controlled expression of proinflammatory genes following macrophage activation. In fact, we demonstrate that the majority of DNA methylation gains and histone modifications are established in the MO-to-MAC differentiation step, similar to what were observed by Vento-Tormo and colleagues, and their disruption by cambinol results in aberrant post-LPS upregulation of proinflammatory genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the essentiality of DNA methylation in gene expression by specifically inhibiting MO-to-MAC DNA hypermethylation utilizing DAC, and we show that although DAC inhibits methylation prior to LPS challenge, aberrant upregulation of gene expression is not observed until after MAC activation.</p><p>In conclusion, our work directly identifies SIRT1/2, through direct interaction with DNMTs, as essential factors in the establishment of gains of methylation, as well as additional epigenetic modifications that prevent premature expression of proinflammatory genes during differentiation to MACs and prior to their encounter to bacterial antigens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Expression and methylation array data for this publication have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession numbers GSE131115 and GSE131177.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1127_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz1127_supplemental_file.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="SEC6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>
