In vision, each opsin type is restricted to specific cells. The situation in this respect in sperm cells is not known. It is also not known whether or not both signaling pathways, found to function in sperm thermotaxis, are each activated by specific opsins, as in vision. Here we addressed these questions. Choosing rhodopsin and melanopsin as test cases and employing immunocytochemical analysis with antibodies against these opsins, we found that the majority of sperm cells were stained by both antibodies, indicating that most of the cells contained both opsins. By employing mutant mouse sperm cells that do not express melanopsin combined with specific signaling inhibitors, we furthermore demonstrated that rhodopsin and melanopsin each activates a different pathway. Thus, in mammalian sperm thermotaxis, as in vision, rhodopsin and melanopsin each triggers a different signaling pathway but, unlike in vision, both opsin types coexist in the same sperm cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cellular imaging</kwd><kwd>Cell signalling</kwd><kwd>Chemotaxis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sperm thermotaxis has been demonstrated in humans, rabbits and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In this process, sperm cells swim to a warmer temperature by actively changing their swimming direction according to the temperature gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The changes in swimming direction are mainly done by modulating the frequency of turns and hyperactivation events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Not every sperm cell can respond by thermotaxis to the temperature gradient. Only capacitated cells do, i.e., cells that acquired a state of ripening, which confers on them the ability to fertilize the oocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Since the process of capacitation (ripening) occurs asynchronously, only up to ~10% of the sperm population are capacitated at any given moment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and, therefore, only up to ~10% are thermotactically responsive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Hitherto, due to obvious reasons, sperm thermotaxis has only been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, the finding that a temperature gradient is generated at ovulation within the oviduct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> strongly suggested that sperm thermotaxis also occurs <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and acts there as a long-range guidance mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. As a matter of fact, sperm thermotaxis was recently even employed for selecting high-quality cells for intracellular sperm insemination (ICSI), resulting in large improvement of the ICSI outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The thermosensors for sperm thermotaxis in mammals are opsins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These are G-protein-coupled receptors known to act as photosensors in vision. In mammalian eyes, at least nine opsin types are known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Each of them is restricted to a specific cell type. For example, rhodopsin (Opsin-2) is present in rod cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; blue opsin (Short-wave-sensitive opsin 1), green opsin (Medium-wave-sensitive opsin 1), and red opsin (Long-wave-sensitive opsin 1) are present in cone cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>; melanopsin (Opsin-4) is located in retinal ganglion cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; and encephalopsin (Opsin-3) and neuropsin (Opsin-5) exist in retinal pigmented epithelium of the inner retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Opsins are also present in organs other than eyes, including the brain, lungs, liver, kidneys and skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but their functions in these organs are still obscure. In Drosophila larvae, rhodopsin acts as a thermosensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In mammalian sperm cells, not only rhodopsin but also other opsins were shown to be involved in thermosensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, a number of different opsins were demonstrated to be present in sperm cells, inhibition of specific opsins significantly reduced the thermotactic response, and sperm thermotaxis of rhodopsin-knockout mice was 70% reduced. This reduction was larger than expected for the elimination of a single thermosensor out of several, suggesting the importance of rhodopsin for thermotaxis and possibly the existence of a lattice-like array of thermosensors that is disrupted when rhodopsin is removed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Such an array of rhodopsin is known to be present in the visual system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Notably, the signaling pathways known to function in the visual system, the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and the transducin/cyclic nucleotide pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, also function in sperm thermotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In the visual system, the opsin involved in the PLC pathway is melanopsin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, whereas the other opsins are likely involved in the transducin/cyclic nucleotide pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In sperm cells, inhibition of either pathway alone causes partial inhibition of thermotaxis, but inhibition of both together completely inhibits thermotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. All these suggest that both rhodopsin and melanopsin may be important for sperm thermotaxis.</p><p id="Par4">Mammalian sperm cells are able to respond to extraordinarily small temperature differences. For example, a human sperm cell is able to thermotactically respond to a temperature difference as small as &#x0003c;0.0006&#x02009;&#x000b0;C when it swims its body-length distance, and do it over a wide temperature range (at least 29&#x02013;41&#x02009;&#x000b0;C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To explain this hypersensitivity, it was speculated that each sperm cell contains multiple opsin types, each type differently distributed in the cell and associated with only one of the two signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Here we put these speculations to the test, employing rhodopsin and melanopsin as test cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">To determine whether each sperm cell contains both rhodopsin and melanopsin, which, as summarized above, are exclusively located within a different cell type in the visual system, we took an immunocytochemical approach. We incubated human sperm cells, which had been allowed to capacitate, with goat anti-rhodopsin antibody and, simultaneously, with rabbit anti-melanopsin antibody, and then with specific fluorescent secondary antibodies. As a control for the specificity of the secondary antibodies, we skipped the incubation with the primary antibodies and incubated the cells with the fluorescent secondary antibodies only. Employing confocal microscopy, we found that the majority of sperm cells were indeed stained by both antibodies (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), indicating that most of the cells contained both opsins together. The antibodies primarily stained the postnuclear cap, midpiece, equatorial ring and, in the case of rhodopsin, the acrosome, but other locations were occasionally stained as well (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for detailed analysis). As a control for the specificity of the primary antibodies, we also carried out these experiments with mouse sperm cells, comparing between wild-type and rhodopsin- or melanopsin-knockout mice. A quantitative analysis revealed specific staining with anti-rhodopsin antibody in the acrosome, equatorial ring, postnuclear cap and midpiece (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and with anti-melanopsin antibody in the acrosome and the equatorial ring (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). While we cannot validate, in the absence of a similar negative control for human sperm cells, the locations of these opsins in human cells, the results, combined together, suggest that rhodopsin and melanopsin are present at several locations in the cell.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Both rhodopsin and melanopsin are present in same sperm cells.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Types of stained cells</th><th>Percentage of cells<sup>a</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cells stained by both anti-rhodopsin and anti-melanopsin antibodies<sup>b</sup></td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>Cells stained by anti-rhodopsin antibody only</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cells stained by anti-melanopsin antibody only</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Cells neither stained by anti-rhodopsin nor by anti-melanopsin antibodies</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Human sperm cells were washed and incubated for capacitation as described in Methods.</p><p><sup>a</sup>The total number of cells used for the counting and considered as 100% was 58 (out a total of 105 cells photographed; staining of the other cells could not be determined with sufficient confidence).</p><p><sup>b</sup>See Methods for the antibodies used.

To put to the test the speculation that this is also the case in sperm thermotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, we measured thermotaxis of sperm cells retrieved from mice that do not express melanopsin (<italic>Opn4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; <italic>Opn4:tdTomato</italic><sup>+</sup>). These mice are expected to signal in thermotaxis via the transducin/cyclic nucleotide pathway only. This is because, in vertebrate vision, only melanopsin signals via the PLC pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Our expectation was that thermotaxis of sperm cells from these mice should be sensitive to an inhibitor of the transducin/cyclic nucleotide pathway but not to that of the PLC pathway. We, therefore, tested the effects of inhibitors of these pathways on sperm thermotaxis of these mice. We compared the effects of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that inhibits the transducin/cyclic nucleotide pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, with that of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB), a PLC pathway inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. IBMX was shown earlier to have comparable inhibitory effects on sperm thermotaxis as do other phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and to be highly effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. 2APB blocks both store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (SOCs) and IP<sub>3</sub>R, but SOCs are not involved in sperm thermotaxis, and 2APB partially inhibits thermotaxis by blocking the IP<sub>3</sub>R Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It&#x000a0;was shown to be effective and comparable to another PLC inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As expected, while IBMX significantly inhibited thermotaxis, 2APB (verified to be effective on wild-type sperm&#x000a0;cells) did not (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Other parameters that can affect sperm accumulation in the warmer compartment &#x02014; the fraction of motile cells, their linear velocity, and the level of capacitated cells (defined herein as the level of A23187-induced acrosome-reacted cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>) &#x02014; did not contribute to the inhibition by IBMX and were not affected by the inhibitors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). The lack of effect of the inhibitors on motility was also evident from the no-gradient control, i.e., from the sperm migration to the other thermotaxis compartment in the absence of a temperature gradient, which was comparable in the presence and absence of the inhibitors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>), and from the other measured motility parameters (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Note that because capacitation reflects the sperm ability to fertilize an oocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and because it involves many biochemical and signaling processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, its level is an excellent control for the overall physiological state of the sperm cells. The comparable capacitation level between all three conditions tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>) therefore suggests that the inhibitors did not affect the physiological state of the sperm cells. Taken together, the results suggest that in sperm cells, as in vision, rhodopsin and melanopsin each triggers a different signaling pathway.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effects of inhibitors of the transducin/cyclic nucleotide pathway and of the PLC pathway on sperm cells of mice that do not express melanopsin.

Yet, the results could not confirm the assumption of a different distribution of each opsin type, at least not major differences.</p><p id="Par10">A comparison between the thermotactic activity of melanopsin-knockout mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>) relative to wild-type mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>) suggests that the absence of melanopsin caused ~50% decrease in thermotactic activity. This decrease seems larger than expected from knockout of a single opsin out of several. The same was argued for rhodopsin-knockout mice, where the thermotactic activity was found to be 70% reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To account for the larger-than-expected reduction in thermotactic activity, it was proposed that rhodopsin is arranged in sperm cells in a lattice-like array (consistent with the high supramolecular organization of rhodopsin in the rod membrane in the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> &#x02014; organization that appears essential for the photosensitivity of rod cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>), and this array is disrupted when rhodopsin is removed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The same interpretation may hold for the larger-than-expected reduction in thermotactic activity in melanopsin-null mice, suggesting that both rhodopsin and melanopsin are part of the lattice, if indeed exists. Notably, the remaining ~50% activity in the case of melanopsin-null mice still enabled to measure the effect of inhibitors on the activity, unlike in the case of rhodopsin-null mice, where the remaining 30% activity was too low for testing it.</p><p id="Par11">In conclusion, rhodopsin and melanopsin coexist in the same sperm cells, their distributions vary to some extent but they do co-localize, and, as in vision, each of them triggers a different signaling pathway: rhodopsin prompts the transducin/cyclic nucleotide signaling pathway and melanopsin &#x02014; the PLC pathway. More studies are required to establish how these features contribute, if at all, to the extraordinary temperature sensitivity of mammalian sperm thermotaxis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Antibodies</title><p id="Par12">The anti-rhodopsin antibody (I-17) and anti-melanopsin antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany) and Novus Biologicals (Colorado, USA), respectively.
