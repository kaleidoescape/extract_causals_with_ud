However, the role of lncRNA MEG3 in melanoma has seldom been studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">RT-PCR was used to examine the expressions of lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin in melanoma patients and cell lines. Then, the biological functions of lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin were demonstrated by transfecting lncRNA MEG3-siRNA, lncRNA MEG3-overexpression, E-cadherin-siRNA and E-cadherin-overexpression plasmids in melanoma cell lines. Moreover, CCK8 assay and colony formation assay were utilized to assess the cell proliferation; Transwell assay was performed to evaluate the cell invasive ability; and tumor xenografts in nude mice were applied to test the tumor generation. Additionally, the target interactions among lncRNA MEG3, miR-21 and E-cadherin were determined by dual luciferase reporter assay. Finally, RT-PCR and WB were further conducted to verify the regulatory roles among lncRNA MEG3, miR-21 and E-cadherin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The clinical data showed that lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin expressions were both declined in carcinoma tissues as compared with their para-carcinoma tissues. Moreover, lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin expressions in B16 cells were also higher than those in A375 and A2058 cells. Subsequently, based on the differently expressed lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin in these human melanoma cell lines, we chose B16, A375 and A2058 cells for the following experiments. The results demonstrated that lncRNA MEG3 could suppress the tumor growth, tumor metastasis and formation; and meanwhile E-cadherin had the same effects on tumor growth, tumor metastasis and formation. Furthermore, the analysis of Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves also confirmed that there was a positive correlation between lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin. Ultimately, dual luciferase assays were further used to verify that lncRNA MEG3 could directly target miR-21 which could directly target E-cadherin in turn. Additionally, the data of RT-PCR and WB revealed that knockdown of lncRNA MEG3 in B16 cells inhibited miR-21 expression and promoted E-cadherin expression, but overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 in A375 and A2058 cells presented completely opposite results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Our findings indicated that lncRNA MEG3 might inhibit the tumor growth, tumor metastasis and formation of melanoma by modulating miR-21/E-cadherin axis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Melanoma</kwd><kwd>lncRNA MEG3/miR-21/E-cadherin regulatory axis</kwd><kwd>Development and progression of tumor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012245</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014A020212434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Chaoying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">Melanoma is the highest lethal cancer of the common skin cancers which is listed as the seventh most frequent malignant tumor in females and the fifth most frequent malignant tumor in males world wide and metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive form of this cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The incidence and mortality of melanoma have continued to increase steadily in industrialized Caucasian populations over the past decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Epidemiological data clearly revealed that 74,100 individuals suffered from melanoma annually while 8700 die per year in the United States, so melanoma seriously affects human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the notable improvements in treatments made in recent years, the prognosis remains poor for advanced melanoma patients, mainly due to its high mortality with intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, aggressive clinical behavior and faster metastatic potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For early-stage melanoma, many methods are used for the treatment of melanoma, including surgery, combined chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular targeted therapy, and meanwhile surgery is always recognized as the mainstay of treatment with 90% cure rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, early melanoma detection is the key to improving the survival and once the diagnosis is delayed, the mortality of melanoma would be rapidly elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it is very difficult for dermatopathologists in clinical work to determine the histopathologic types and tumor stages of melanoma in a subset of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Hence, better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms about malignant melanoma tumorigenesis and progression will be helpful to explore novel sensitive and specific biomarker or therapeutic agents.</p><p id="Par17">Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), defined as a group of transcripts with a length &#x0003e;&#x02009;200 nucleotides with limited protein coding potential, have been implicated in the onset and development of different human cancers by chromatin remodeling, as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, lncRNA DLX6-AS1 promotes liver cancer by increasing the expression of WEE1 via targeting miR-424-5p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; lncRNA MORT overexpression inhibits cancer cell proliferation in oral squamous cell carcinoma by downregulating ROCK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; lncRNAGIHCG induces cancer progression and chemoresistance and indicates poor prognosis in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].It has been found that lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) with tumor suppressor activity was frequently either lost, mutated or decreased level in many human tumors and tumor derived cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For instance, lncRNA MEG3 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer by modulating miR-9-5p/QKI-5 axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; Down regulation of lncRNA MEG3 promotes colorectal adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and inhibits the apoptosis by up-regulating TGF-&#x003b2;1 and its downstream sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; lncRNA MEG3 suppresses the tumorigenesis of hemangioma by sponging miR-494 and regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, lncRNA MEG3 was also explored in the development of melanoma, e.g., lncRNAMEG3 suppresses the proliferation and invasion of melanoma by regulating CYLD expression mediated by sponging miR-499-5p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, previous studies have uncovered that miR-21 was strongly expressed in melanoma and was related to the degree of dedifferentiation and aggressiveness of melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, miR-21 has been considered as a &#x0201c;mastermind of metastasis&#x0201d; in many cancers, such as melanoma, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, bioinformatics analysis displayed that there might be a targeted regulatory interaction between lncRNA MEG3 and miR-21. Furthermore, based on the faster metastasis function of miR-21, E-cadherin, responsible for adhesion of melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], was also discovered to be a target gene of miR-21. Therefore, in this study, we sought to look at the relationship among lncRNA MEG3, miR-21 and E-cadherin, and further investigate the possible role of lncRNA MEG3/miR-21/E-cadherin regulatory axis in progression of melanoma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and specimens</title><p id="Par18">A total of 25 melanoma patients who diagnosed without other severe diseases and mental health problems were recruited to the present study in the Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) from January 2013 to December 2017.

Before describing the follow-up results, we hereby make a statement. We chose B16 (mouse cell line) and A2058/A375 (human cell line) not to compare the difference between mouse cell line and human cell line, but only because lncRNA MEG3 was highly expressed in mouse cell lines and low in human cell lines, and we wanted to investigate the biological role of high and low expression of lncRNA in melanoma cells, regardless of cell lineage differences. At first, lncRNA MEG3-siRNA was transfected into B16 cells, while lncRNA MEG3-overexpression plasmid was transfected into A2058 and A375 cells. The transfected efficiency was determined by qRT-PCR which exhibited that lncRNA MEG3 expression was decreased in lncRNA MEG3-siRNA treated B16 cells, and lncRNA MEG3 expression was increased in lncRNA MEG3 treated A2058 or A375 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Then, CCK8 assay was used to observe the cell proliferation. It was found that lower lncRNA MEG3 expression in B16 cells gradually promoted cell proliferation, but higher lncRNA MEG3 expression in A2058 or A375 cells gradually impeded cell proliferation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Furthermore, the colony formation assay, which also represented cell growth indexes, presented a similar trend with CCK8 assay in different groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Thus, these data indicated that lncRNA MEG3 transfected B16 cells had more obvious stimulative effect on melanoma cell proliferation than lncRNA MEG3-siRNA transfected A2058 and A375 cells.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>The role of lncRNA MEG3 in tumor growth of melanoma. <bold>a</bold> RT-qPCR was used to verify the transfected efficiency of lncRNA MEG3-siRNA and lncRNA MEG3-overexpression plasmids. <bold>b</bold> CCK8 assay was utilized to examine the cell proliferation of melanoma cells. <bold>c</bold> Colony formation assay was applied to evaluate the cell proliferation of melanoma cells</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12935_2019_1087_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

It was discovered that cell migration was elevated dramatically by lncRNA MEG3 knockdown in B16 cells, while cell migration was conspicuously reduced by lncRNA MEG3 overexpression in A2058 and A375 cells when compared with respective controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In addition, in the experiment of tumor xenografts, it was displayed that in comparisons with B16 group, the tumor volume was substantially elevated in B16-lncRNA MEG3-siRNA group, but the tumor volume in A2058 or A375 group was notably lighter than that in A2058-lncRNA MEG3 or A375-lncRNA MEG3 group, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). As well, after 44&#x000a0;days, all nude mice were sacrificed for tumor weight examination and the results revealed that the tumor weight in B16-lncRNA MEG3-siRNAgroup was greater than that in B16group, whereas the tumor weight was sharply decreased in A2058-lncRNA MEG3 or A375-lncRNA MEG3 group as compared to their corresponding control groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Hence, these findings implied that lncRNA MEG3 suppression might enhance the tumor metastasis and formation of melanoma cell.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>The role of lncRNA MEG3 in tumor metastasis and formation of melanoma. <bold>a</bold> Cell migratory ability was determined by transwell assay. <bold>b</bold> The progression of tumor generation was assessed by tumor xenografts in nude mice</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12935_2019_1087_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

Additionally, as similar with the expression of lncRNA MEG3 in melanoma cell lines, it was uncovered that the expression of E-cadherin was higher in HEMn and B16 cells than that in A2058 and A375 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c).

Stable E-cadherin-siRNA transfected B16 cells and stable E-cadherin transfected A2058 and A375 cells were confirmed by WB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Next, these stable cell lines were applied to determine the biological functions of E-cadherin. CCK8 assay and colony formation assay both verified that knockdown of E-cadherin markedly elevated the B16 cell growth, and overexpression of E-cadherin remarkably reduced the A2058 and A375 cell growth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, c). In addition, transwell analysis pointed out that the migratory capacity of E-cadherin-siRNA B16 cells was enhanced compared with that of the B16 group, whereas the overexpression of E-cadherin expression decreased the migratory capacity of the A2058 and A375 cells as compared to their respective controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Furthermore, we established an in vivo pretreated xenograft nude mouse model to further explore the role of E-cadherin. As illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b, compared to B16 group, depletion of E-cadherin led to a quick tumor growth in vivo, but when compared with A2058 and A375 groups, forced E-cadherin expression resulted in obvious retardation of tumor growth in vivo. After 44 d, E-cadherin-siRNA transfected B16 cells produced larger tumors than those in B16 cells, whereas E-cadherin-transfected A2058 and A375 cells produced smaller tumors than those in A2058 and A375 groups. The above results were in accordance with these findings in the melanoma cell lines treated with lncRNA MEG3-overexpression and lncRNA MEG3-siRNA plasmids.

Moreover, it is responsible for 75&#x02013;80% of deaths from skin cancer and generally higher in fair-skinned population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In recent years, there were still no satisfactory treatments to fight melanoma, especially for the advanced patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Accumulating evidence revealed that the etiology of melanoma involved environmental, phenotypic and genetic risk factors, so a large number of researchers began to pay their attentions to the molecular level, in order to find useful biomarkers for non-invasive early detection or new effective therapeutic targets in melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. lncRNAs, historically dismissed as junk or nonfunctional transcriptional noise, play crucial roles in different cancers through modulating gene expression with various mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. lncRNA MEG3, located in the chromosome 14 DLK1-MEG3 imprinting region, were down-regulated in a variety of primary human cancers, including lung cancer, hepatocellular cancer, multiple myeloma, meningioma and glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the current study, it was also discovered that lncRNA MEG3 presented a declining trend in carcinoma tissues as compared with their para-carcinoma tissues of melanoma. Moreover, the expression level of lncRNA MEG3 was intimately associated with the survival rate of melanoma, which suggested that lncRNA MEG3 might be served as a prognostic indicator in development of melanoma. Factually, it has been reported that lncRNA MEG3 expression level correlated with tumor grade and prognosis in meningiomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In order to further excavate the functions of lncRNA MEG3, we examined the expression of lncRNA MEG3 in different melanoma cell lines and finally selected 3 strains of melanoma cell lines for the following study. The results showed that downregulation of the expression of the lncRNA MEG3 promoted melanoma growth, metastasis and formation; thereby it speculated that lncRNA MEG3 might exert a tumor suppressor role in development of melanoma. Additionally, mounting studies also verified that lncRNA MEG3 inhibited tumor initiation and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, lncRNA MEG3 inhibits breast cancer growth via upregulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and activating NF-&#x003ba;B and p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; lncRNA MEG3 impacts proliferation, invasion, and migration of ovarian cancer cells through regulating PTEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">E-cadherin has been implicated in a number of signaling pathways that enhance cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and cell&#x02013;cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Once the cell-to-cell junction is destroyed, it may lead to the metastasis of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, metastasis of tumor cells is a significant marker of tumor progression, which indicates that the tumor has reached an irreversible level and is difficult to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, in this study, we subsequently detected the expression of E-cadherin in melanoma patients and cell lines. It was exhibited that E-cadherin expression in carcinoma tissues was notably lower than that in their para-carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, based on the different expressions of E-cadherin in melanoma cell lines, it was further investigated the biological effects of E-cadherin in vitro. The data displayed that knockdown of E-cadherin accelerated melanoma tumor growth, metastasis and formation. The above results related to E-cadherin were amazingly similar with the results of lncRNA MEG3 treatment. Hence, we boldly guessed whether there is a potential relationship between lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin. Moreover, the analysis of Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves indeed manifested that there was a positive correlation between lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin. Fortunately, we have also found a key link molecule (that is miR-21) between lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin through bioinformatics screening.</p><p id="Par39">Previous study has confirmed that miR-21 was over-expressed in primary cutaneous melanomas when compared with benign nevi, and was also highly expressed in melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, high levels of miR-21 are correlated with advanced tumor stage, degree of invasion and tumor recurrence of melanoma patients, which mainly due to miR-21 could inhibit mRNA expression of crucial tumor suppressor proteins; thereby miR-21 acted as a key oncogene in malignant melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the present study, dual luciferase reporter assay firstly used to determine the interaction between lncRNA MEG3 and miR-21. And the data clearly denoted that miR-21 was a target gene of lncRNA MEG3. Over the past decades, lncRNAs functioned as competing endogenous (ce)RNAs to sponge miRNAs and regulated their downstream signaling pathways is a research hotspot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. On the other hand, the target relationship between miR-21 and E-cadherin was also detected by dual luciferase reporter assay. Thus, it was speculated that lncRNA MEG3 restrained the expression of miR-21 via sponging miR-21, and meanwhile down-regulation of miR-21 could promote the expression level of downstream target gene E-cadherin. This assumption meets well with the above results about the expressions of lncRNA MEG3 and E-cadherin in clinical samples. In addition, the finally WB results of E-cadherin definitely disclosed that when giving miR-21 inhibitor in lncRNA MEG3 higher expressed B16 cells, the E-cadherin expression was remarkably increased, but when giving miR-21&#x02009;+&#x02009;lncRNA MEG3 in lncRNA MEG3 higher expressed B16 cells, the E-cadherin expression was markedly decreased. Furthermore, in lncRNA MEG3 lower expressed A2058 and A375 cells, the expression of E-cadherin presented an opposite trend. These data further proved the targeted regulatory interaction among lncRNA MEG3, miR-21 and E-cadherin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par40">In conclusion, this report emphasizes that lncRNA MEG3 acts as an antitumor lncRNA for malignant melanoma by regulating miR-21/E-cadherin axis.
