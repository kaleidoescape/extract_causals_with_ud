The intent of this review of medications that cause hyperglycemia and their mechanisms of action is to help guide clinicians in prevention, screening and management of pediatric drug-induced hyperglycemia. We conducted a thorough literature review in PubMed and Cochrane libraries from inception to July 2019. Although many pharmacotherapies that have been associated with hyperglycemia in adults are also used in children, pediatric-specific data on medication-induced hyperglycemia are scarce. The mechanisms of hyperglycemia may involve &#x003b2; cell destruction, decreased insulin secretion and/or sensitivity, and excessive glucose influx. While some medications (eg, glucocorticoids, L-asparaginase, tacrolimus) are markedly associated with high risk of hyperglycemia, the association is less clear in others (eg, clonidine, hormonal contraceptives, amiodarone). In addition to the drug and its dose, patient characteristics, such as obesity or family history of diabetes, affect a child&#x02019;s risk of developing hyperglycemia. Identification of pediatric patients with increased risk of developing hyperglycemia, creating strategies for risk reduction, and treating hyperglycemia in a timely manner may improve patient outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hyperglycemia</kwd><kwd>medications</kwd><kwd>pancreatic diabetes</kwd><kwd>pediatrics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Euglycemia is a tightly controlled state regulated by the interplay of multiple hormones that balance glucose production and clearance. Among the hormones, insulin has the strongest effect on glucose metabolism. Several medications impair the production, secretion, or action of insulin and thus may lead to drug-induced hyperglycemia. Although the incidence of drug-induced hyperglycemia in children is unknown, with the advent of new medications that are known to cause hyperglycemia, it is expected to be on the rise. Drug-induced hyperglycemia increases the burden of care of patients and is associated with less favorable outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, diabetic emergencies and premature death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref></p><p>The objective of this review is to identify and describe the drugs that can cause hyperglycemia, with an emphasis on the pediatric population. Because of acute and long-term complications of hyperglycemia, it is critically important for pediatricians to recognize medications&#x02019; role in causing hyperglycemia, be familiar with the mechanism of actions, and develop strategies to minimize its frequency and related complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a bibliographic search in PubMed and Cochrane Library databases from inception to July 2019 using the keywords <italic>drug induced diabetes, drug induced hyperglycemia, medication induced diabetes, and medication induced hyperglycemia</italic>.

Evidence on increased islet cell autoimmunity with certain medications has been emerging. Many pharmacotherapies, particularly newer anticancer medications, modulate immune checkpoint proteins, modify T cell regulatory function, and increase the risk of immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Decreased insulin secretion</title><p>Hyperglycemia induces a series of intracellular signals that result in the release of insulin secretory granules that were previously synthesized, processed and stored.

This results in inhibition of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, increased glucose transport to fat and muscle tissue, and stimulation of glycogen synthesis. Drugs that reduce the receptor number or affinity, interfere with insulin action, or inhibit postreceptor events can cause hyperglycemia by decreasing insulin sensitivity. In addition, some drugs decrease insulin sensitivity in target tissues through indirect mechanisms such as weight gain, leading to obesity-induced insulin resistance.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Excessive glucose influx</title><p>There are several physiologic processes that release glucose into the circulation (eg, hepatic glycogenolysis, hepatic gluconeogenesis) while others (eg, glycogen synthesis) remove glucose. Medications that enhance glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis may result in hyperglycemia. In addition, excessive glucose intake, particularly through a parenteral route, may overwhelm the pancreatic capacity of insulin production and cause hyperglycemia.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Multihit hypothesis</title><p>Hyperglycemia does not occur in all individuals exposed to diabetogenic drugs but it is more common when several factors are involved, including: (1) Host-specific factors such as obesity, insulin resistance or &#x003b2; cell autoimmunity. (2) High doses of diabetogenic medications or multiple medications that affect glucose metabolism (ie, additive effect). (3) Environmental influences (eg, diet, stress, illness, lack of physical activity).</p><p>For some medications, efforts directed at identifying individuals at risk of developing drug-induced hyperglycemia are hindered by its sporadic occurrence. Conversely, risk factors have been better described in patient populations and for medications associated with a higher incidence of hyperglycemia. For example, among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), those with older age, obesity, and family history of diabetes have higher probability of developing hyperglycemia.<xref rid="R6"

Glucocorticoids are used in a myriad of conditions making the population heterogeneous. Second, as the patients&#x02019; clinical condition evolves, often, different compounds, routes of administration, schedules, and doses are used. In addition, other medications, stress, inflammation, and underlying &#x003b2; cell dysfunction may have additive effects.

These drugs block T cell mediated immune response by inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase activity. However, calcineurin is widely distributed in other tissues including the pancreas, and thus its use has been associated with hyperglycemia.

If a patient is considered to be at high risk for developing hyperglycemia, efforts should focus on prevention strategies. Depending on the clinical scenario, potential approaches include delaying therapy until the patient attains an age-appropriate weight for height, promoting regular physical activity, and ensuring a healthy diet. In addition, clinicians should, if feasible, prescribe medications with lower risk of hyperglycemia, and avoid combination of two or more diabetogenic drugs as clinically appropriate. Finally, protocols for monitoring hyperglycemia should be in place in hospitals and ambulatory practices using diabetogenic medications frequently.</p><p>Monitoring hyperglycemia in at-risk populations should include patient education on the signs and symptoms of diabetes as well as blood glucose monitoring at regular intervals. The frequency and method of monitoring blood glucoses should be tailored to the drug regimen and individual risk factors. For example, in ill patients who are receiving high doses of drugs associated with hyperglycemia (eg, induction chemotherapy for ALL), fasting blood glucoses every few days may be necessary. On the other hand, for patients who are on long-term therapy with a medication associated with increased weight and insulin resistance, a HbA1c every few months is a reasonable approach. It must be emphasized that the HbA1c value is not reliable in patients with rapid red blood cell turnover or who are receiving blood transfusions.</p><p>For standardization purposes, diabetes should be diagnosed following the criteria established by a recognized professional organization, such as the American Diabetes Association (ADA) or the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD).<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63 64</xref> If the patient meets the criteria for diabetes, it is essential to conduct an individualized assessment of risk factors, including a thorough family and past medical history, review of all current medications, physical exam and determination of pancreatic islet autoantibodies&#x02019; titers. Additional insight regarding the mechanism of hyperglycemia may be sought by obtaining stimulated insulin, C peptide levels and/or if islet autoantibodies if an autoimmune mechanism is suspected.</p><p>Treatment options for children with diabetes are limited. With very few drugs approved in the pediatric population, the concern of polypharmacy, and multiple comorbidities in the majority of patients who develop hyperglycemia, insulin remains the angular rock. Other approaches, such as metformin and dietary management can also be considered, particularly if the mechanism of hyperglycemia is related to insulin resistance and weight gain. In a small study of children with ALL and drug-induced hyperglycemia (n=17), 70% of patients achieved glycemic control with metformin alone.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Liraglutide may also be considered in certain cases of medication-induced hyperglycemia as it has been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of T2D in children 10 years of age or older. As mechanisms of drug-induced hyperglycemia are better understood and as more antidiabetic drugs are approved in the pediatric population, the tool kit will expand. Finally if clinically possible, a less diabetogenic regimen for the underlying illness should be considered.</p><p>The goals of treatment of drug-induced hyperglycemia are to eliminate symptoms, if present, to decrease glucose to a target range that prevents acute complications of hyperglycemia such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or diabetic ketoacidosis, and to prevent long-term sequelae of diabetes. The benefits of euglycemia should be weighed against the risks of hypoglycemia, particularly when using insulin. Since the risks of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are different in the acutely ill compared with the stable outpatient setting, these will be discussed separately.</p><p>In the pediatric intensive care setting, hyperglycemia has been associated with poor outcomes.<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> However, achieving tight glucose control is challenging as many patients have poor oral intake, if any, and, most importantly, they may not be able to recognize or communicate the symptoms of hypoglycemia, and therefore rely exclusively on glucose monitoring. Additionally, the target glucose range continues to be controversial as the benefit of tight blood glucose control on morbidity and mortality has been inconsistent. A single-center randomized control trial conducted in 700 critically ill infants and children in a pediatric intensive care setting showed improved short-term outcomes (ie, decreased length of stay, mortality and inflammation marker) at the expense of increased frequency of hypoglycemia in those with lower target blood glucose levels (50&#x02013;80&#x02009;mg/dL in infants and 70&#x02013;100&#x02009;mg/dL in children) compared with the group with higher target blood glucose levels (&#x0003c;215&#x02009;mg/dL).<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> In contrast, a recent multicenter trial that compared tight glucose control (80&#x02013;110&#x02009;mg/dL) with a higher glucose target (150&#x02013;180&#x02009;mg/dL) was stopped early due to low likelihood of benefit, and possibility of harm in the tight glucose control group.<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> In this study, lengths of stay were similar in both groups, but the group with the lower glucose target had higher rates of hypoglycemia and higher rates of infection. Consequently, in the critically ill patients, it is reasonable to have a blood glucose target of 120&#x02013;180&#x02009;mg/dL and decrease it as the patient improves clinically and the risk of hypoglycemia decreases. These values continue to be arbitrary and may change as more data become available.</p><p>In the outpatient setting, tighter glucose control should be attempted. Children with T1D and T2D have increased risk of microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and cardiovascular disease; and improved glycemic control decreases such risk.<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> Even though there are no studies on long-term outcomes of microvascular and macrovascular disease in drug-induced diabetes, many of these patients (eg, transplant patients, childhood cancer survivors) are already at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, and therefore preventing any additional potential damage is important.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> One of the drawbacks of tighter glucose control is increase in the burden of care and hence the potential decrease in quality of life with frequent insulin administration and blood glucose monitoring. However, if hyperglycemia is expected to be long-standing, and the patient is otherwise stable, glucose and HbA1c goals set by ADA or ISPAD should be followed.<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71 72</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Medication-induced hyperglycemia usually originates from insulin resistance and/or decreased insulin secretion. Many of the molecular mechanisms for the changes in insulin secretion/action as well as the basis for the variability between patients are poorly understood. In the majority, although not all, of the cases, host susceptibility and drug-drug amplification effects are identified. All patients with drug-induced hyperglycemia should have a thorough evaluation of risk factors and possible drug interactions. Consideration should be given to addressing modifiable risk factors and using less diabetogenic drug regimens in at-risk patients or patients who have hyperglycemia. Treatment should be directed to normalizing blood glucoses while preventing hypoglycemia. Insulin remains the cornerstone of treatment of drug-induced hyperglycemia in children, as other treatment strategies are limited in the pediatric population.</p><p>This area represents a growing research opportunity as many unknowns remain, from molecular mechanisms of drug-induced hyperglycemia, to incidence of hyperglycemia in the pediatric population, and to better elucidation of risk factors. The identification of genetic risk factors may provide an explanation for those children who develop hyperglycemia but do not present manifestations of the metabolic syndrome phenotype. Collaborative, multi-institutional databases of cases of medication-induced hyperglycemia would facilitate an exchange of information among clinicians and researchers. Finally, clinical trials on the pediatric population with drug-induced hyperglycemia are needed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JV-C and MT wrote the manuscript draft.
