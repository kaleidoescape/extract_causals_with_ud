A mechanism of chronic inflammation is the formation of inflammasome complexes which results in the sustained secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1&#x003b2; and IL18. Inflammasome expression and actions vary among cancers. There is no information on inflammasome expression in ovarian cancer (OvCa). To determine if ovarian tumors express inflammasome components, mRNA and protein expression of NLRP3 (<underline>n</underline>ucleotide-binding domain, <underline>l</underline>eucine-rich <underline>r</underline>epeat family, <underline>p</underline>yrin domain containing <underline>3</underline>), caspase-1, IL1&#x003b2;, and IL18 expression in hen and human OvCa was assessed. Chicken (hen) OvCa a valid model of spontaneous human OvCa. Hens were selected into study groups with or without tumors using ultrasonography; tumors were confirmed by histology, increased cellular proliferation, and expression of immune cell marker mRNA. mRNA expression was higher for hallmarks of inflammasome activity (caspase-1, 5.9x increase, p = 0.04; IL1&#x003b2;, 4x increase, p = 0.04; and IL18, 7.8x increase, p = 0.0003) in hen OvCa compared to normal ovary. NLRP3, caspase-8 and caspase-11 mRNA did not differ significantly between tumor and non-tumor containing ovaries. Similar results occurred for human OvCa. Protein expression by immunohistochemistry paralleled mRNA expression and was qualitatively higher in tumors. Increased protein expression of caspase-1, IL1&#x003b2;, and IL18 occurred in surface epithelium, tumor cells, and immune cells. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a potential tumor suppressor and NLRP3 regulator, was higher in hen (2.4x increase, p = 0.002) and human tumors (1.8x increase, p = 0.038), suggesting a role in OvCa. Collectively, the results indicate that inflammasome expression is associated with hen and human OvCa, although the NLR sensor type remains to be determined.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCI R03CA182120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5693-3323</contrib-id><name><surname>Luborsky</surname><given-names>Judtih</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014042</institution-id><institution>DOD Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-08-1-0203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5693-3323</contrib-id><name><surname>Luborsky</surname><given-names>Judtih</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Swim Across America Inc</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barua</surname><given-names>Animesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was made possible by NIH grant NCI R03CA182120 (JL), DOD grant W81XWH-08-1-0203 (JL) and Swim Across America (AB).

There is increasing evidence that inflammasome formation promotes a chronic, pro-inflammatory environment [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the role of inflammasomes in cancer progression remains unclear since inflammasome expression varies among tumor types and pro- and anti-tumor effects occur in different cancers [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Inflammasomes are large multi-protein complexes, composed of a sensor (receptor), an effector and an adaptor protein that control the activation of caspase-1 [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Activated caspase-1 stimulates the production of IL1&#x003b2; and IL18. Inflammasomes are categorized based on their sensor types and include NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and NLRP6 [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], each activated by different signals [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the best-characterized inflammasome [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is primarily cytoplasmic and contains the sensor NLR (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain [NOD]-like receptors), the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) and the effector protein caspase-1. The NLRP3 inflammasome has a broad range of activators such as dsRNA, extracellular ATP or asbestos [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. NLRP3 inflammasome assembly activates caspase-1 which then converts pro-interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL1&#x003b2;) and pro-interleukin-18 (IL18) to active IL1&#x003b2; and IL18 [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IL1&#x003b2; and IL18 are apex regulators of pro-inflammatory pathways. A consequence of inflammasome activation is pyroptosis, a form of programmed lytic cell death that is distinct from apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in tumor development, although the precise role of the NLRP3 inflammasome is unclear [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] since the cytokines it produces suppress some cancers, while they facilitate tumorigenesis of other cancers. For example, in hepatocellular carcinoma, patients with <italic>low</italic> expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components had a worse prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Colitis-associated cancer was higher in NLRP3 knockout mice models; the increased tumor burden was correlated with attenuated levels of tumor IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>increased</italic> NLRP3 inflammasome activity promotes skin and breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There is no information on inflammasome expression in ovarian tumors.</p><p>The molecular regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome involves both positive and negative regulatory pathways, and regulation occurs at the transcriptional and post-translational levels [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) negatively regulates NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in macrophages by inhibiting NLRP3 transcription [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. AHR expression is increased in multiple cancers [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is expressed in human ovarian cancer, and the endogenous AHR ligand, 2-(1'H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), inhibits ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In turn the tumor suppressor AHRR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor) inhibits AHR and reduces inflammation and cancer progression [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In normal cells, AHR activation induces AHRR which then negatively regulates AHR. In cancer cells, the AHRR-AHR feedback loop is interrupted by methylation of the AHRR promoter which blocks its expression. The absence of AHRR results in the induction of genes associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The study objective was to determine if the NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, caspase-1), and the corresponding cytokine products, IL1&#x003b2; and IL18, were increased in ovarian tumors. AHR and AHRR were assessed to determine if the expression correlated with the inflammasome in ovarian cancer. We used the hen, an animal model of spontaneous human ovarian cancer, that has been shown to have validity as a model of ovarian cancer based on histological, biochemical and immunologic similarities to human ovarian cancer [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Human Protein Atlas suggests human ovarian tumors express NLRP3, caspase-1, IL1&#x003b2; and IL18 [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. But there is limited experimental information on expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes in human ovarian tumors. Therefore human samples were examined for comparison to observations in hen ovaries to provide an indication of the generalizability of hen results to human OvCa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p><bold>Tissues:</bold> White Leghorn hens (3 years old, strain W96) were housed at the poultry farm of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Animal Science. Food and water were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>, and hens were maintained on a 17:7 hours (light: dark) schedule. Ovarian morphology was evaluated using transvaginal ultrasound as described previously (26); the data were used to select hens with normal ovaries (n = 8) or ovarian tumors (n = 10). Transvaginal ultrasound is not associated with pain or suffering and does not require anesthesia or analgesia. Hens were rapidly euthanized by standard cervical dislocation and the ovaries were removed and immediately placed in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). This study complied with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&#x00026;E) stained sections of ovary were analyzed for tumor type and stage based on similarities to human morphology, as we established in a previous report (28). In summary, early stage (I and II) tumors are confined to the ovary (stage I) or ovary and oviduct (stage II). Later stage tumors (III and IV) have local abdominal and peritoneal metastases with ascites (stage III) or distant metastases with profuse ascites (stage IV).</p><p>Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the ABC method (Vectastain) in sections of human and hen ovarian and tumor tissue.

Oligoperfect Designer software (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) was used to design each primer and the endogenous actin control. 25 ng of the first strand was used for each PCR reaction as template. PCR comprised initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes, followed by 35 cycles (each cycle at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 57&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 minute). PCR amplicons were separated in a 3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR product was purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then sequenced (DNA sequencing facility, University of Illinois at Chicago; ABI BigDye Terminator in an ABI 3100 Genetic analyzer, Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA) using the same primers. The contour quantities of bands in gels (density of the band multiplied by the area of the band) were measured using Quantity One software (BioRad, Hercules, CA).

This finding is important since inflammasomes are a druggable target. Drugs targeting the inflammasome could reduce inflammation and cancer progression [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In summary, the protein expression of the inflammasome components detected by immunohistochemistry occurred in both immune cells and tumor cells. Expression patterns of protein were similar in chicken and human ovarian tumors. AHR, a potential inflammasomes regulator, was similarly higher in hen and human ovarian cancer.</p><p>This is the first report of the general expression of inflammasomes in ovarian cancer. Chang [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] used expression profiling to identify mechanisms involved in the malignant transformation of endometriosis to ovarian cancer; 18 genes were identified, including NLRP3, IL-1B, and IL-18, which implicated inflammasomes. They found a significant correlation between the expression levels of the target genes and the progression-free patient survival; high expression levels of AIM2 and NLRP3 were significantly correlated with low progression-free survival.</p><p>The mRNA and protein expression results were correlated qualitatively for each of the measures. For example, caspase-1 mRNA expression was dramatically higher, and the protein expression detected by anti-caspase-1 antibody was intense in human and hen tissue. However, within each tissue section, the expression was not uniform; it varied by cell type and areas within the sections. In some cases, such as for IL18, immune cells stained intensely by immunohistochemistry while ovarian tumor cell cytoplasm stained moderately.</p><p>For caspase-1 and IL18, the pattern of stained cells was similar in hen and human tumor tissue. The results for IL1&#x003b2; were similar except that human tumor tissue stained more often than in the hen, which might be explained by differences in the antibody efficacy for hen and human immunohistochemistry. Also, samples were selected randomly from the hen ovary for different analyses. Since the tissue is not homogeneous, samples from ovaries with earlier stage tumors may not have similarly represented tumor cells, which could potentially contribute to variations in the immunohistochemistry staining and differences between hen and human tissue. Despite these considerations, the mRNA and protein results were remarkably similar, both within hens and between hen and human ovaries.</p><p>NLRP3 mRNA and protein levels were low and did not differ between normal and tumor ovaries. Although surprising in light of the elevated caspase-1, IL1&#x003b2;, and IL18, this is consistent with other reports that NLRP3 expression is relatively low in various cell types [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, inflammasome reactions often occur in macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An influx of macrophages into tumors is well documented [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and we showed increased mRNA for the chicken macrophage marker in tumor ovaries. Although NLRP3 expression did not differ between normal and tumor ovaries, NLRP3 levels were significantly correlated with the macrophage marker MRCL1B.</p><p>A possible explanation for the lack of increased NLRP3 expression, despite elevated caspase-1, IL1&#x003b2; and IL18, is that only specific locations have cells with activated NLRP3 (i.e., a cluster of invading immune cells at the tumor/tissue interface) and tissue was from regions without altered NLRP3. However, this is not likely since different samples were used for immunohistochemistry and mRNA. Furthermore, the result was the same in hen and human. Moreover, if the NLRP3 result were due to a technical issue, such as an ineffective antibody, or an inappropriate PCR primer, then the results of hen and human and immunohistochemistry and PCR would not be similar; a different anti-NLRP3 antibody was used for hen and human immunohistochemistry and species-specific primers were used. There are several possible reasons that NLRP3 expression did not differ between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue: (i) a different NLR inflammasome (e.g., NLRP1 or NLRC4) is involved in IL18 production [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], or (ii) low-level NLRP3 expression leads to caspase-1 activation without significant synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Increased expression of NLRP1 occurs in breast cancer, and its transfection into cell lines promotes proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. NLRP1, but not NLRP3, promotes melanoma (42). Although an NLRP1-like gene occurs in the hen [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it was not possible to evaluate NLRP1 expression at this time since appropriate reagents are currently not available.</p><p>In response to specific stimuli, NLR expression is thought to be regulated in two steps. There are also canonical and non-canonical activation pathways. Canonical activation of the NLR inflammasome in response to a stimulus involves transcription and then oligomerization which proceed independently [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Non-canonical NLR activation also involves transcription and oligomerization [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The primary caspase in canonical and non-canonical activation of IL18 production differs; canonical activation involves caspase-1 while non-canonical activation proceeds through caspase-11 (mouse)/caspase-4,5 (human) [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Factors and mechanisms in priming and activation remain to be clarified for most inflammasomes including NLRP3. For example, contrary to the initial models based on macrophage studies, in which the activated NLRP3 inflammasome is an oligomer of NLRP3, Salmonella simultaneously activates two NLRs, NLRP3 and NLRC4, and both are required in the same inflammasome oligomer to stimulate IL-1&#x003b2; processing [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the current study, caspase-1 expression was significantly elevated while caspase-11 (non-canonical NLRP3 activation pathway) and caspase-8 (apoptosis pathway) did not change, suggesting activation of the canonical NLR pyroptosis pathway.</p><p>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates biological responses to aryl hydrocarbons, such as dioxin and dioxin-like compounds. It is present in various species and controls xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450s, principally CYP 1A1 [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. AHR also has a role in immune function including, for example, in the generation of regulatory T cells, and control of the balance between Treg and Th17 cell differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. AHR signaling has a critical function in carcinogenesis; AHR null mice lacking AHR developed liver tumors more frequently after exposure to a hepatic carcinogen (diethylnitrosamine), compared to wild type mice [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>AHR is expressed in the human ovary and its expression does not vary during the menstrual cycle or with age [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Birds, including chickens, also express AHR [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227081.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. AHR has a role in follicle development and steroid hormone production since there are fewer advanced follicles and lower sex steroid production in AHR knockout mice [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>AHR is constitutively activated in many cancers [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In human ovarian cancer, there is one report that AHR mRNA was not changed in primary tissue [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], while another study found that AHR expression was elevated in ovarian cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We found that AHR expression was greater in human and chicken ovarian cancer.</p><p>AHRR represses AHR and may act as a tumor suppressor; reduced expression was reported in malignant ovarian tissue, and it is hypermethylated in OvCa [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. AHRR is conserved in the chicken relative to the negative regulation of AHR and ER&#x003b1; activities, but functional mechanisms may differ among mammalian and fish homologs [<xref rid="pone.0227081.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We found AHRR was elevated in human and chicken OvCa although it was only significant in the human tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Collectively, the data show that inflammasome components were higher in both hen and human OVCA. Inflammasome expression appears in immune cells and tumor cells. The specific NLR sensor remains to be determined since NLRP3 did not differ in ovarian tumors and normal ovary. Also, AHR expression increased similarly in hen and human tumors. Immune reactions may differ during the development and progression of a tumor and it is possible that additional or different reactions may be a response to a tumor. While the mechanisms involved in inflammasome effects on tumorigenesis remain to be determined, this study sets a platform for examining the relationship between tumor initiation and early inflammatory events in ovarian cancer development. Furthermore, the chicken model has potential use for pre-clinical testing of therapeutics targeting inflammasomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227081.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Demographic Data for Ovarian Cancer Patients.</title><p>Tissue for mRNA was obtained at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) (Chicago, IL).
