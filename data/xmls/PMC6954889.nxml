It is considered to have a generally favourable safety profile but concerns have been raised due to the risk of agranulocytosis. We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral deferiprone as a treatment for patients with iSS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We present a case series of 10 consecutive patients presenting with classical iSS treated with deferiprone.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Ten patients were followed up for a mean period of 2.3&#x000a0;years (range 0.5&#x02013;5.5&#x000a0;years). Four patients (40%) were withdrawn from treatment because of treatment-related side effects. The&#x000a0;reasons for treatment discontinuation were neutropenic sepsis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) and fatigue (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). In 2 out of the 3 cases&#x000a0;of neutropenic sepsis, patients initially developed neutropenia&#x000a0;without sepsis. The mean time to neutropenic sepsis following deferiprone was 1.2&#x000a0;years (range 0.3&#x02013;2.5) with mean neutrophil count of 0.4 (range 0.3&#x02013;0.5). Six patients (60%) reported no change in neurological function while on treatment, and four patients (40%) reported that&#x000a0;their condition deteriorated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Deferiprone was poorly tolerated, with 40% of patients withdrawing from treatment, most commonly due to neutropenic sepsis, after an average of 2&#x000a0;years on treatment.

Clinicians treating iSS patients with deferiprone should be aware that this drug&#x000a0;has a&#x000a0;potentially life-threatening side effect&#x000a0;of neutropenic sepsis, and should&#x000a0;ensure that appropriate haematological&#x000a0;monitoring is in place.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Superficial siderosis</kwd><kwd>Deferiprone</kwd><kwd>Dural defects</kwd><kwd>Iron chelation</kwd><kwd>Agranulocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Central nervous system (CNS) infratentorial superficial siderosis (iSS) is a rare but disabling neurological condition that results from hemosiderin deposition on the pial surface of the brain and spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Patients underwent a standardised series of investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] including brain and spinal MRI, CSF analysis and CT myelography&#x000a0;(as appropriate), all of which were reviewed by a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) of neurologists, neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, and&#x000a0;haematologists, with input from&#x000a0;clinical biochemists. If the MDT was unable to identify a cause treatable via radiological or surgical means, then the patient was considered for medical treatment with deferiprone.</p><p id="Par9">Patients were started on oral deferiprone, usually at a dose of 500&#x000a0;mg twice daily and up-titrated to 30&#x000a0;mg/kg, as suggested in a previous safety trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Monitoring included regular full blood counts (initially weekly), and serum ferritin (measured every 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks). If stable after 3&#x000a0;months on treatment, a full blood count was then&#x000a0;performed every 4&#x000a0;weeks. Changes in patient-reported neurological function and side effects were collected by a neurologist during clinic visits every 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months. Our outcomes of interest were: agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count of 0.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L or lower), neutropenic sepsis (temperature higher than 38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or symptoms and/or signs of sepsis in a person with a neutrophil count of 0.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L or lower) and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count of 2.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L or lower).</p><p id="Par10">MRI T2*-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) and Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) scans were performed at baseline and yearly following initiation of treatment. There are no current validated scales to measure the extent of siderosis burden in patients with iSS. MRI images were subjectively reviewed by a senior neuroradiologist to assess whether siderosis was focal or extensive as well as to monitor for changes in infratentorial siderosis burden over time. Despite the lack of scales available to assess clinical severity, we subjectively classified patient&#x02019;s disease severity as &#x02018;Severe&#x02019; if patient&#x02019;s symptoms impair their ability to lead an independent life.

The largest study of deferiprone in iSS (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) reported no episodes of agranulocytosis during a 2&#x000a0;year follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, in the previous study, patients who developed neutropenia were not re-challenged with deferiprone following discontinuation of drug due to concerns about further side effects. It is possible that the increased rate of agranulocytosis in cohort is due to two of our patients being re-challenged following development of neutropenia and subsequently developing agranulocytosis. It may be the case that these particular patients are more susceptible to neutropenia for patient-specific reasons, and that re-challenge resulted in a more severe reaction. There were no other significant differences in baseline characteristics (including disease duration) in our study compared to the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, all cases of agranulocytosis in our study occurred within 2.5&#x000a0;years of treatment initiation, broadly similar to the follow period reported in the above study, making it unlikely that there is an increased risk of neutropenia with longer treatment duration.</p><p id="Par17">The mechanism of agranulocytosis with deferiprone is unclear. It has been argued that the effect is idiosyncratic or immune-mediated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and independent of dose or of iron overload level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although these variables were not studied systematically. However, deferiprone causes dose-dependent neutropaenia and bone marrow hypoplasia in laboratory animals, inhibiting granulocyte/macrophage colony forming units (CFU-G&#x02009;+&#x02009;Mac) in a dose-dependent manner, as well as causing cell cycle arrest through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Increased toxicity of deferiprone&#x000a0;was previously reported in mice lacking iron overload than in overloaded animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Agranulocytosis was also noted in two out of 20 (10%) of patients receiving deferiprone receiving treatment for Parkinson's disease for 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; these patients also lacked systemic iron overload. In the absence of generalised iron overload, relatively more iron-free chelator will be available in the systemic circulation for chelation of key metabolic iron pools involved in cell division. Thus, the increased agranulocytosis risk (30%) in this series is consistent with such a chelation-mediated mechanism.</p><p id="Par18">In our cohort, 60% of patients reported stability of their neurological symptoms. Previously published data described 63% of subjects reporting no progression of disease or an improvement in at least one neurological domain over a period of 2&#x000a0;years on deferiprone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. iSS is known to lead to progressive neurological decline, but periods of stability may arise in the natural history of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It was clear that there was no detectable clinical or radiological response to deferiprone in our cohort, even for those who tolerated the drug for a reasonable period of time. The advanced degree of the disease, as evidenced by the clinical and radiological findings in these patients, could partly explain the lack of success of this treatment. We also acknowledge the lack of validated scores to quantify the progression of impairments and functional ability in patients with iSS.</p><p id="Par19">Despite the retrospective case-based nature of the study and absence of long-term follow-up, we have shown that deferiprone can be associated with significant side effects in the treatment of iSS. The limitations in our study reflect the fact that iSS is a rare disease, without consensus criteria for investigating clinical and radiological progression. An international multicentre randomised controlled trial with clearly defined clinical and surrogate endpoints using validated scales and biomarkers would be challenging given the rarity of iSS, but could help to establish the hazards, benefits and effects on disease pathophysiology following deferiprone treatment. In the meantime, clinicians treating iSS patients with deferiprone should be aware that treatment has potentially life-threatening side effects, and ensure that appropriate monitoring is in place so that these events can be rapidly identified and treated.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="ethics"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="Par20">There was no specific funding for this study.
