An immune-mediated pathogenesis is suspected though not yet proven. We have recently reported on the clinical and histologic features, and identification of select leukocyte cell populations within the lesion. A clinical and histologic similarity to oral lichen planus of people was proposed. In the present study, these initial observations are extended by examining lesions from 24 dogs with clinical evidence of chronic ulcerative stomatitis. Because dogs with chronic ulcerative stomatitis often have concurrent periodontal disease, we wondered if dental plaque/biofilm may be a common instigator of inflammation in both lesions. We hypothesized that dogs with chronic ulcerative stomatitis would exhibit a spectrum of pathologic changes and phenotype of infiltrating leukocytes that would inform lesion pathogenesis and that these changes would differ from inflammatory phenotypes in periodontitis. Previously we identified chronic ulcerative stomatitis lesions to be rich in FoxP3+ and IL17+ cells. As such, we suspect that these leukocytes play an important role in lesion pathogenesis. The current study confirms the presence of moderate to large numbers of FoxP3+ T cells and IL17+ cells in all ulcerative stomatitis lesions using confocal immunofluorescence. Interestingly, the majority of IL17+ cells were determined to be non-T cells and IL17+ cell frequencies were negatively correlated with severity on the clinical scoring system. Three histologic subtypes of ulcerative stomatitis were determined; lichenoid, deep stomatitis and granulomatous. Periodontitis lesions, like stomatitis lesions, were B cell and plasma cell rich, but otherwise differed from the stomatitis lesions. Direct immunofluorescence results did not support an autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disease process. This investigation contributes to the body of literature regarding leukocyte involvement in canine idiopathic inflammatory disease pathogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009525</institution-id><institution>WALTHAM Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TC 03102016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6065-2516</contrib-id><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>J.

We have previously described the clinical, radiographic, clinicopathologic and histopathologic characteristics of this disease.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] We have further provided a preliminary and qualitative characterization of the inflammatory cell infiltrate that characterizes CCUS lesions. Specifically, we showed that CCUS lesions are rich in both B and T lymphocytes, as well as IL-17 producing cells. The current study is focused on further elucidating the immuno-pathogenesis of this poorly understood and devastating disease.</p><p>Further use of the pseudonym Canine Ulcerative Paradental Stomatitis has been discouraged as approximately 40% of the lesions occur adjacent to edentulous areas and are therefore not paradental. The clinical findings of CCUS are characterized by painful oral mucosal ulcers of varying size, pattern, appearance, and distribution. The disease is refractory to common medical therapies, and many clinicians have resorted to full-mouth tooth extraction as a salvage measure. We have introduced a clinical scoring system, called the Canine Ulcerative Stomatitis Disease Activity Index (CUSDAI) in an attempt to quantify disease severity and response to various therapeutic regimens &#x0201c;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227386.s001">S1 Table</xref>&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] CCUS histopathology typically features a densely arrayed inflammatory cell infiltrate at the interface between the superficial mucosal epithelium and subepithelial connective tissue (lichenoid infiltrate) that is composed of B cells, plasma cells, CD3 T cell subsets (including FoxP3+), neutrophils, and fewer mast cells within the deep submucosa.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] An initial evaluation using multi-color immunofluorescence (IF) on a small number of CCUS cases, revealed moderate numbers of infiltrating IL17+ cells; interestingly the majority of these cells were determined to be CD3 negative.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Given the fact that CCUS patients respond poorly to current medical treatment strategies, there is a strong interest to better define the underlying pathogenesis of CCUS.</p><p>Detailed description of the various inflammatory cell infiltrates is a critical first step in understanding the pathogenesis. Since expansion of the T helper 1 (Th), Th2 paradigm, the relevance of Th17 cells, and their integral control of the tissue-based immune response alongside T regulatory (Treg) cells has been foundational.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227386.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The IL17 family of cytokines are potent inducers of inflammation and help to protect against multiple microbial pathogens. However, these cytokines may also contribute to the tissue destruction that occurs in chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. The potent IL17 cytokine is secreted by specialized CD4 T cells, as well as other T cells, innate-like lymphocytes and other innate immunity cell types.</p><p>The balance between pro-inflammatory IL17 producing cells and immunoregulatory Treg cells in various types of inflammation and autoimmune diseases continues to receive intense investigation.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227386.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Treg cells are thought to be critical regulators of the immune response and T-cell tolerance. It is postulated that in the human oral inflammatory disease, oral lichen planus (OLP), Treg cells are functionally deficient, and thereby fail to control the initiation and maintenance of this autoimmune disease.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In dogs, decreased numbers and function of Treg cells in inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal lymphoma has been shown to contribute to pathogenesis.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227386.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In CCUS lesions, infiltrating FoxP3+ cells have been proposed to play a role in lesion pathogenesis.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Whether these lesion-associated Tregs are functionally deficient or play some kind of balancing role with proinflammatory IL17+ cells, awaits clarification.</p><p>In this CCUS study, tissues from dogs with periodontal disease (PD) were utilized as a comparator lesion as PD is one of the most common oral inflammatory diseases in dogs,[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and often occurs concurrently in dogs with CCUS. Although the anatomic locations of CCUS lesions are known to vary, it was initially observed that dogs had lesions within the buccal mucosa adjacent to teeth (paradental). Many of these &#x0201c;paralesional&#x0201d; teeth had attached plaque biofilm or mineralized calculus, suggesting the possibility that the CCUS lesion might share pathologic features with the biofilm-associated PD lesion. In both humans and dogs, periodontitis is an important chronic inflammatory disease triggered by the oral microbiome and altered by the function or dysfunction of the host&#x02019;s innate, and/or adaptive immune system.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227386.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Given that the role of periodontal disease in the pathogenesis of CCUS is not fully understood, we have included a PD control group in an effort to shed light on potentially shared important pathogenic mechanisms.</p><p>Our goal for the present study was to better define the immunopathogenesis of CCUS by objectively quantifying inflammatory cell infiltrates, determining the pattern of immunoglobulins and complement fragment deposition within CCUS lesions and correlating these finding with clinical findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>For all of the dogs in this study, tissue sampling was performed under general anesthesia (induction with Propofol 4 mg/kg and Valium 0.5 mg/kg intravenous, maintenance with isoflurane inhalant), with appropriate regional local anesthesia (Bupivacaine 0.5% ml amount dependent on animal size) and post-operative analgesic (Hydromorphone 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous) administration.

For some smaller lesions, this represented an excisional biopsy; and in other larger lesions, the biopsy was intralesional. The biopsy tissue was trisected, and sub-specimens were immersed in 10% buffered formalin, isotonic saline, or RNAlater Stabilization Solution (ThermoFisher Scientific). <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227386.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>.

Briefly, FFPE tissue sections were routinely deparaffinized in xylene and serial ethanol dilutions, following heat-induced antigen retrieval (antigen retrieval buffer; Dako). Samples were further blocked with normal donkey serum and FcR Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi) and incubated overnight with rabbit anti-human CD3 polyclonal antibody (1:50 dilutio) and goat antihuman IL17 polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) or rat anti-FoxP3 (1:200 dilution). Twenty-four hours later, slides were extensively washed and treated with donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 555 or donkey anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594 (ThermoFischer Scientific). All secondary antibodies were used at 1:400 dilution. Finally, nuclei were labeled with DAPI (ThermoFischer Scientific). All immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence studies had several layers of negative and positive controls to ensure appropriate interpretation of our findings. Specifically, we have used a &#x02018;No antibody&#x02019; control to determine the level of tissue auto-fluorescence and &#x02018;No primary antibody control&#x02019; to determine the level of non-specific secondary antibody binding. For positive controls we have used canine lymph node sections which contain the various immune cell subsets. Moreover, cell subset distribution within the lymph node tissue was further used to evaluate our positive controls. Five random images magnified at 200x were acquired from each section with a super-resolution confocal microscope (Leica) and analyzed using image analysis software (Image J, NIH and lmaris, Oxford Instruments). A &#x0201c;reactive&#x0201d; (hyperplastic) canine mesenteric lymph node was used as a positive control. The negative control slides omitted the primary antibodies.</p><p>For direct immunofluorescence (DIF), formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy sections of buccal mucosa from 17 dogs diagnosed with CCUS were available for detection of tissue-bound IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies and complement C3 using DIF. Sections of buccal mucosa from five healthy dogs served as controls. All tested tissues were deparaffinized, rehydrated and digested with 0.1% trypsin (MilliporeSigma, St. Lois, MO, USA) for 30 minutes at 37 Celsius. Tissues were rinsed in PBS, subsequently blocked with 1% newborn calf serum (MilliporeSigma, St. Lois, MO, USA) and the sections were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with either rabbit anti-canine IgG (1:400; Alexa Fluor-488 conjugated, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA), goat anti-canine IgM (1:200; FITC conjugated, Bethyl, Montgomery, TX, USA), goat anti-canine IgA (1:400; FITC conjugated, Bethyl, Montgomery, TX, USA) or goat anti-canine C3 (1:100; FITC conjugated, Bethyl, Montgomery, TX, USA) antibodies. Lymph node and mucosal sections from CCUS and healthy dogs in which antibody was replaced by PBS served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Finally, all tissues were mounted with Vectashield Antifade mounting medium with a nuclear counterstain DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Sections were evaluated using a fluorescent microscope and representative images were obtained. The oral mucosa tissues were evaluated for presence of immunostaining within the mucosal epithelium (intercellular, intracellular or nuclear), at the basement membrane level (continuous, patchy) and within the lamina propria. The staining intensity was graded subjectively as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistics were performed with GraphPad Prism 7.0.

Where differences were identified, non-parametric t tests (Mann-Whitney test) were used to explore differences between means.

The histologic subtypes of CCUS, lichenoid stomatitis, deep stomatitis and granulomatous stomatitis, may either represent a continuum disease process or three distinct disease variants. The mean clinical disease score was most severe for the granulomatous variant (25/32). CCUS lesions feature a wide variety of infiltrating leukocytes with moderate to large numbers of T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, FoxP3), B cells (CD20, Mum1), IL17+ cells, macrophages (CD204) and mast cells. Though lesion associated neutrophils were not quantitated, they were present in moderate to large numbers in most of the examined CCUS lesions.</p><p>Both FoxP3+ and CD3-/IL17+ cells are involved in CCUS pathogenesis. However, there were no significant differences in the relative numbers of IL17+ cells and CD3+/IL17+ double positive cells, nor in the cells of the different histologic subtypes, further obscuring the role of IL17. The relatively high levels of Tregs (i.e. FoxP3+ T cells) in CCUS, did not vary between patient clinical severity scores, clinical periodontitis scores, histologic subtypes, gender, or CD3-/IL17+ cells. Whether Tregs in CCUS lesions play an anti-inflammatory role, alter immunosuppression or disrupt mucosal tolerance remains to be determined.</p><p>Th17 cells have emerged as crucial regulators of tissue homeostasis and immunopathology at the oral mucosal barrier.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The IL17 family of cytokines are known to be potent inducers of inflammation and to help protect against invading pathogens; however, they can promote autoimmune disease when working together with Th1 cells and accompanied by chronic immune and inflammatory processes. At this point in our understanding of CCUS pathogenesis, the lesion appears to feature infiltration of mostly CD3 negative IL17+ cells. Neutrophils, though numerous in the interface mucositis, seem to be IL17 negative. Although multiple studies indicate that IL17 is primarily produced by CD4+ Th cells;[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] numerous other cell types appear to be capable of producing IL17 including &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells,[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227386.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] natural killer T cells (NKT), neutrophils,[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] monocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells, vascular smooth muscle cells[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and by follicular helper CD4 T (T<sub>fh</sub>) cells.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Confocal microscopy indicates that IL17+ cells in CCUS lesions are mononuclear in origin; thereby eliminating granulocytes. However, the precise determination of the IL17+ cell phenotype in CCUS lesions is a critical future goal for a more complete understanding of disease pathogenesis.</p><p>Current CCUS data suggests that IL17+ cells may, in part, play some kind of protective role as the clinical severity score is inversely correlated to the number of IL17+ cells within the lesion. That is, as the clinical severity score decreased, the number of lesion-associated IL17+ cells increased.</p><p>The role of IL17 in periodontal disease in people is uncertain, since IL17 has been shown to promote bone destruction but is nonetheless essential to protect the host from pathogens, including periodontopathic organisms.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Defects in Th17 cells and/or their signature cytokines result in significant susceptibility to oral fungal infections.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] As well, amplified/uncontrolled Th17 responses have been documented in periodontitis.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Recent evidence has shown that Th17 cells are more osteoclastogenic than other T helper subsets such as Th1 or Th2. There is also evidence that the periodontopathogen <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> promotes an IL 17 environment in order to obtain nutrients from tissue breakdown products.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227386.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227386.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] IL17 sits at the center of many complex diseases that integrate innate and adaptive immune mechanisms and requires careful study to maximize host protective effects and minimize host deleterious effects.</p><p>PD is the most common chronic inflammatory disease of dogs and often occurs in conjunction with CCUS lesions. In contrast to the highly pleocellular CCUS lesions, the independent canine periodontitis lesions analyzed in this study were predominately characterized by a B cell infiltrate (CD20 and Mum1) but not by infiltrating T cells, macrophages, mast cells or FoxP3+ cells. PD is common in human patients and approximately 10% of the population will develop severe periodontal disease.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227386.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Studies in people have demonstrated that development of periodontitis involves a switch from a gingivitis lesion, mainly mediated by T cells, to one predominated by B cells and plasma cells.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] In PD lesions, B cells have been shown to have both protective and detrimental roles in settings of immunopathology.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] The pathogenesis of human PD seems to involve an interplay between the tooth-associated bacterial biofilm and the host immune response. Severe periodontal destruction is associated with systemic translocation of periodontal microbes and is linked to numerous systemic inflammatory conditions, indicating that, in people, local immune/microbiome imbalance may affect systemic inflammatory processes, either through increased microbial translocation, systemic inflammation, or shared immunological mechanisms.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] The composition of the plaque-associated microbiome in canines with ulcerative stomatitis has recently been determined, and similar conclusions may be relevant. We, as yet, do not know how many IL17+ cells are present within the non-CCUS periodontal disease lesions; though there seemed to be no difference in IL17 numbers between periodontal disease stages within the CCUS population. Implicit in our understanding will be to determine the source of the IL17 in CCUS; and for severe periodontitis if IL17 is present.</p><p>CCUS has multiple pathologic similarities to OLP in people.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] OLP studies suggest FoxP3+Tregs have a more prominent role in lesion pathogenesis when compared to IL17+ cells.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] The majority of FoxP3+ cells in OLP were identified in the sub-epithelial infiltrate, while IL17+ cells were found deeper in the stromal tissues.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] As well, in human patients with clinically erosive OLP lesions, Foxp3 mRNA expression was significantly lower in circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells and tissue explants compared to patients with reticular lesions, and lowest in patients with a history of OLP of more than one year or with a history of relapse.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] This study indicated that Foxp3 expression in patients with OLP was associated with the severity and duration of the disorder, suggesting altered immunosuppression in the development, clinical course and responsiveness to treatment. In another study, impaired suppressive function of CD4+ CD25+ T cells was demonstrated in OLP patients indicating that Tregs in OLP are frequently expanded but functionally deficient. The authors conclude that this may explain why the increased Tregs in OLP fail to control the pathogenesis and development of this autoimmune disease.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] We propose for further investigation in CCUS that the high numbers of FoxP3 may as well be deficient.</p><p>Consideration of the pathogenic mechanisms operating in OLP may be useful to CCUS disease inquiry. At the cellular level, OLP may result from an immunologically induced apoptosis of the basal keratinocytes, due to cytotoxic CD8+ cell response on modified keratinocyte surface antigen. IF in OLP revealed that FoxP3+ cells co-localized with T cells. Double labelling immunofluorescence indicated co-localization of IL17 with tryptase (+) mast cells, solidifying their role in pathogenesis. As there are large numbers of FoxP3+ cells in CCUS as well as IL17+ cells, we do not yet know which cell type is most important. Co-localization studies are planned to determine if IL17+ cells are mast cells, thereby suggesting a role for CCUS as an animal model for OLP.</p><p>One of the hallmarks of OLP diagnosis in human patients is &#x0201c;shaggy fibrinogen staining&#x0201d; at the basement membrane zone on direct immunofluorescence.[<xref rid="pone.0227386.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] Unfortunately, fibrinogen DIF staining was not assessed in these CCUS lesions. DIF staining of the CCUS lesions did reveal different classes of antibodies, IgG, IgA, and IgM, and very little complement, found within mononuclear cells, which likely represent plasma cells infiltrating the lamina propria. None of the tissue specific staining patterns associated with known autoimmune skin diseases such as pemphigus, autoimmune subepidermal blistering skin diseases or lupus erythematosus were observed. This pattern supports the inflammatory nature of CCUS, and perhaps the result of directly cytotoxic T lymphocytes and not a classic auto-antibody immune mediated pathogenesis.</p><p>For future analyses, serum samples from CCUS cases were banked, as were lesion tissue samples for the determination of RNA expression. Flow cytometry or IF could be used to further identify the IL17-expressing cell phenotype. If the source for IL17 can be determined, then potential targeted therapeutics may be developed. Further clarification of the role of IL17 in this spontaneously occurring disease may provide a non-mouse model for other IL17 rich diseases. Determination of the oral microbiome from plaque samples of CCUS lesions is complete and analysis may reveal a dysbiotic trigger in mucosal immunopathology. Other studies are required to determine the function of FoxP3 in CCUS; and whether its exact role is physiologic or pathologic.</p><p>Limitations in the current study include that IL17 IF analysis was not evaluated in periodontitis lesions. Comparisons are therefore limited to the analyses performed.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Three histologic subtypes of CCUS include granulomatous, lichenoid inflammation and deep stomatitis. Leukocyte numbers and distribution are consistent across the CCUS cases and differ from normal and periodontitis controls.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: The authors sought to investigate some leukocyte populations by examining lesions from dogs with chronic ulcerative stomatitis. Nonetheless, there are many concerns described below:</p><p>1. The introduction is too long, and just in this section the authors cited 45 articles. I strongly suggest the authors to be concice.</p><p>2. Line 241. Why the authors used HE or toluidine blue? Why the authors did not standardize the dye used to stain mucosa tissue?</p><p>3. One of my major concerns are the antibodies used in immunohistochemistry. What is the specificify of the antibodies used for dogs? The cross-reactivity of all antibodies used must be proven (e.g. anti-CD20, anti-Mum1 and anti-CD204)? How the authors titrate the antibodies? All antibodies used to identify leukocyte populations are monoclonal antibodies (e.g. anti-CD20)? This information should be clearly stated. Why the authors did not include a negative control in immunohistochemistry assay? The controls of immunohistochemistry should be carefully conducted (please, for more details see: Hewitt et al., J Histochem Cytochem. 2014). How the authors select their antibodies? Why the authors used CD20 to identify B cells ("CD20 is expressed primarily on B cells but has also been detected on both normal and neoplastic T cells" available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/RB-9013-P0#/RB-9013-P0?">https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/RB-9013-P0#/RB-9013-P0?</ext-link> Why the authors used anti-CD204 (a macrophage scavenger receptor) antibody to identify macrophages?</p><p>4. Please, provide clearly the information about the monoclonal antibodies used to identify CD4+ and CD8+ cells. It is also a pity that CD4 and CD8 antibodies were not used together. Unfortunately, the importance of T CD4 CD8 double negative (e.g Fisher et al., Blood, 2005; D'Acquisto, Biochemical Phamarcology, 2011) and even positive (e.g. Cl&#x000e9;net et al., Sci. Rep., 2019) cells was neglected in the present study. Furthermore, it would be great if the macrophage subsets has been considered.</p><p>5. The cross-reactivity of anti-human IL17 antibody must be determined/shown. The specifications of all antibodies used should be clearly stated (if possible, include the catalog number).</p><p>6. It is a pity that the authors did not quantify IL-17 by qPCR in tissue, and the producing cells is not clearly identified.</p><p>7. Line 389-390. The PloS One rules recommended that al data should be clearly showed.</p><p>8. The conclusion section should be profoundly revised.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This was a well designed and rigorously performed analysis of the pathological processes in this frustrating disease of the canine oral cavity. It is good to see mounting evidence of the likely immune-mediated pathway, in order that further research can hopefully lead to better methods of control or cure.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
