Using yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) tagged MreB, it was initially suggested that MreB forms a continuous, cell-spanning helical filament running along the inner membrane of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A reevaluation of these conclusions using electron cryotomography showed that the cell spanning MreB helix is an artifact introduced by the YFP-tag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, helical localization patterns were reported for many other fluorescently tagged bacterial proteins (e.g. chemoreceptors, secretion proteins, RNase E, and the chromosome partitioning protein SetB) but often the questions remains how well these observations reflect the true situation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Therefore, label-free methods are critically required in order to validate findings obtained by this commonly used method. One way to achieve this goal is the detection of proteins by immunofluorescence. This approach typically requires permeabilization or removal of the bacterial cell envelope in order to allow antibody penetration into bacterial cells. However, this experimental step provides a major source of artifact generation because removal of the cell wall significantly affects the integrity and structure of the cell. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a non-invasive protocol enabling the three-dimensional (3D-) visualization of proteins in serial sections of bacterial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy or immunogold labeling envisioned by electron microscopy. So far, serial sections electron microscopy (ssEM) of tissues and organs has been successfully used to, for example, reconstruct the 3D ultrastructure of the nervous system from higher organisms such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, at present no ssEM protocol was available to investigate protein localization in entire bacterial cells.</p><p id="Par5">Therefore, to challenge the feasibility of this approach, we used the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> alkaline shock protein 23 (Asp23) as a model to gain a deeper insight into the spatial organization of Asp23 within the cell. Asp23 is the eponym of the poorly investigated Asp23 protein family (also termed DUF322, PF03780 or Gls24 family). Members of this protein family are exclusively present in Gram-positive bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, where they are functionally linked to lipid metabolism (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, survival at low pH and during nutrient limitation (<italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the bile stress response (<italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, cell morphology control (<italic><underline>Enterococcus faecalis</underline></italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and nutrient sensing (<italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these functions remain to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par6">For the <italic>S. aureus</italic> Asp23 protein a critical function in cell envelope homeostasis was shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Asp23 attaches to the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane through its interaction with the membrane protein AmaP (Asp23 membrane anchoring protein) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and deletion of either <italic>asp23</italic> or <italic>amaP</italic> leads to strong induction of the cell wall stress response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Interestingly, aligning with its membrane localization properties and cell envelope related function, it was recently reported that loss of Asp23 leads to increased resistance towards the cell membrane-targeting antibiotic daptomycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The molecular function of Asp23, however, is still unclear. Using our serial section electron microscopy and immune-labeling protocol, we show a distribution pattern of Asp23 compatible with the formation of Asp23 filaments, a property of Asp23 that we also demonstrate <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results provide a framework for future investigations analyzing the relationship between Asp23 oligomer formation and function.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The <italic>S. aureus</italic> Asp23 protein and the serial section microscopy workflow.

This observation raises the question to which extent the fluorescent label alters the functional properties of Asp23, and demands an alternative method to investigate the sub-cellular architecture of Asp23 in a label-free manner. The ability of Asp23 to form filamentous structures is also supported <italic>in vitro</italic> with purified Asp23, which appears in extended telephone cord-like structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">To clarify whether Asp23 does form filaments <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of a tag and to visualize the 3D-distribution of Asp23 in <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, serial sections of <italic>S. aureus</italic> wild type and <italic>amaP</italic> mutant cells were probed with an antibody specific to Asp23. After immuno-labeling of Asp23, bound antibodies were visualized either by fluorescence microscopy, or by immunogold labeling combined with electron microscopy. Using the freely available software Reconstruct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, the fluorescence and electron micrographs were processed to reconstruct the Asp23 3D distribution within individual cells (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d&#x02013;f</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">We found that the minimal section thickness suitable for immunofluorescence was 100&#x02009;nm (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), while immunogold labeling and subsequent electron microscopy were compatible with sections of 50&#x02009;nm thickness. It became evident that the section plane significantly affects the appearance of cellular structures when imaging objects as small as bacteria by electron microscopy. This is particularly obvious with the cell wall. Approaching the bottom or the top of the cell, sections will cut through the cell wall at a steadily increasing angle with the consequence of decreasing the cell wall signal-to-noise ratio (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In this case, simple calculations can help to guide the positioning of the cell wall borders during image segmentation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Orientation of the section during immune-detection of antigens also affected the apparent localization of the antigen. For instance, on sections close to the top of the cell, gold-labeling on the upper side produced images where the protein appeared to be localized within the wall structure, while gold-labeling on the lower side suggested a cytoplasmatic localization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Thus, the positioning of cell borders must be carefully considered before volume reconstruction to avoid protein mislocalization in the final model.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Analysis of Asp23 distribution.

The Asp23 distribution in wild type cells confirmed the observation that during cell division Asp23 does not localize to the septum and further revealed that Asp23 is not distributed evenly at the cell membrane, as initially suggested by fluorescence microscopy of Asp23-Cer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e (iii),f(ii)</xref>).

Using antibodies of different specificity and labeled with gold particles of various size, colocalization experiments could also be carried out. Since only the antigens on the surface of the section are accessible to the antibody, a partially patchy distribution for the targeted protein might result. Finally, this method is limited to fixed cells and the analysis of localization dynamics is therefore only possible at discrete time points. However, while these obstacles may impede the demonstration of finer distribution patterns, distinct arrangements like rings in the case of Asp23 can be reconstructed with reasonable precision (Supplementary Movies&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) The protocol developed here and our findings on spatial Asp23 distribution provide the framework to further evaluate if and how oligomerization affects Asp23 membrane localization and function in the cell envelope stress response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par13">The procedure outlined here serves as an easily adoptable tool to visualize the 3D-distribution of proteins within objects as small as bacterial cells.
