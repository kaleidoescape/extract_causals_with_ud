The etiology and pathogenesis of CF is unknown, and lack of biomarkers hampers development of diagnostic tests and successful therapy. Recent studies on the changes of amino acid levels and other metabolites in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalopathy (CFS/ME) have pointed to possible central defects in energy metabolism. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of serum concentrations of amino acids, including metabolites of tryptophan, the kynurenine pathway and vitamin B6 in a well characterized national Norwegian cohort of lymphoma survivors after high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Among the 20 standard amino acids in humans, only tryptophan levels were significantly lower in both males and females with CF compared to non-fatigued survivors, a strikingly different pattern than seen in CFS/ME. Markers of tryptophan degradation by the kynurenine pathway (kynurenine/tryptophan ratio) and activation of vitamin B6 catabolism (pyridoxic acid/(pyridoxal + pyridoxal 5'-phosphate), PAr index) differed in survivors with or without CF and correlated with known markers of immune activation and inflammation, such as neopterin, C-reactive protein and Interleukin-6. Among personal traits and clinical findings assessed simultaneously in participating survivors, higher neuroticism score, obesity and higher PAr index were significantly associated with increased risk of CF. Collectively, these data point to low grade immune activation and inflammation as a basis for CF in lymphoma survivors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008730</institution-id><institution>Kreftforeningen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smeland</surname><given-names>Knut Halvor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008388</institution-id><institution>Radiumhospitalets Forskningsstifltelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4484-9319</contrib-id><name><surname>Foss&#x000e5;</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Bevital AS</institution></funding-source><award-id>Salary</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Midttun</surname><given-names>&#x000d8;ivind</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Bevital AS</institution></funding-source><award-id>Salary</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueland</surname><given-names>Per Magne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported in part by research funding from the Norwegian Cancer Society and Radiumhospitalets legater. &#x000d8;M and PMU are both at least partially employed by Bevital, a non-profit organization.

It is a common symptom in a wide variety of disorders, for instance, in patients with inflammatory or infectious diseases, depression disorder and cancer [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Together with post-exertional malaise, a marked aggravation of symptoms after exercise, fatigue is also the hallmark symptom in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalopathy (CFS/ME) [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Whereas acute fatigue is a healthy, adaptive response to physical or mental exertion and typically resolves after rest or sleep, persistent fatigue is often disproportional to exerted activities and is generally not completely alleviated after a period of rest. The pathophysiological changes leading to persistent fatigue in different diseases are poorly understood and no specific treatment is available to ameliorate fatigue in affected individuals.</p><p>Chronic cancer-related fatigue (CF, defined as pronounced fatigue for &#x02265; 6 months) is a common and distressing late effect after cancer treatment affecting patients treated for both solid cancers and hematological malignancies [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CF has been described in 25&#x02013;35% of long-term survivors of breast cancer, lymphoma or testicular cancer in Norway, compared to 11% in a national representative population [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These patients are cured of their malignancies but may suffer from other late effects where fatigue may be an associated symptom. The etiology and pathophysiology of CF in cancer survivors is largely unknown, though evidence suggests it may be multifactorial, influenced by demographic, somatic and psychological factors [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The incidence varies with the type of cancer and treatment given and seems to increase in the presence of psychological discomfort such as anxiety, pessimism, low mood or depression. Somatic comorbidities such as endocrine abnormalities, pulmonary dysfunction or cardiovascular disease may predispose patients to CF [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the care of survivors with CF, it is important to rule out and treat such coexisting symptoms and conditions. Some studies point to an ongoing low grade inflammatory process in patients with CF after breast cancer or lymphoma [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Despite knowledge of these associated conditions, the absence of an etiological and pathophysiological understanding of CF limits the ability to diagnose and treat CF. For example; it is not known whether the mechanisms underlying fatigue in different medical conditions are similar. Recently, large scale metabolic studies in CFS/ME have revealed underlying defects related to key pathways of metabolism that discriminate patients with CFS/ME from healthy individuals, providing a possible basis for future diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We and others found in patients with CFS/ME that circulating concentrations of amino acid and other metabolites fueling energy generation in the tricarboxylic acid were altered and energy metabolism hampered [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Such observations have allowed generation of hypotheses as to mechanisms driving fatigue and associated symptoms in CFS/ME [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>On this background, we recently assessed the prevalence of CF in a national cohort of adult lymphoma survivors treated with high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT) [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We investigated associations between CF and disease- and treatment-related characteristics, psychological factors and objectively measured somatic health, including cardiorespiratory fitness and selected cytokines. CF is a prevalent long term condition affecting about 30% of these survivors and our data suggest ongoing low grade inflammation as a pathogenic mechanism. With the aim to explore further the underlying metabolic defects driving CF in cancer survivors, we now extend these studies to metabolic analyses as previously done in CFS/ME, comparing individuals with or without CF. We report here metabolic analyses in lymphoma survivors with a median follow-up of 10 years after HDT-ASCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patients</title><p>The study was part of a national multicenter cross-sectional study performed in 2012&#x02013;2014 [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. All survivors treated with HDT-ASCT for lymphoma in Norway from 1987 to 2008, aged &#x02265;18 years at HDT-ASCT, resident in Norway at survey, in remission and not currently undergoing systemic therapy for active malignancy, were eligible as described earlier (n = 399) [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

The range of analyzed metabolites was focused on amino acids and pathways related to inflammation, immune activation and vitamin B6.</p><p>The study was planned to evaluate possible changes in amino acid concentrations in survivors with CF as previously described in patients with CFS/ME [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In CFS/ME these changes have been indicative of a defect in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and have been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Importantly, the defects in energy metabolism could be responsible for post exertional malaise, a key clinical finding associated with fatigue in CFS/ME. No similar differences in amino acid concentrations were found when we compared lymphoma survivors after HDT-ASCT that suffer from CF to survivors without CF. The blood samples were taken under standardized fasting conditions. Since we are interested in diagnostic biomarkers of CF, potentially with relevance to pathogenic mechanisms, we deliberately chose to compare survivors with or without fatigue. As gender differences have been described in CFS/ME, we did all analyses in males and females separately. Since levels of amino acids and vitamins of the B- family may depend on nutritional status and intake of dietary supplements, relevant differences in serum concentrations were analyzed also with regard to BMI, other proposed blood markers of nutrition and against self-reported intake of vitamin supplements. The absence of similar changes of serum amino acid levels in the present study indicates different pathomechanisms in lymphoma survivors with CF and patients with CFS/ME, explaining also the clinical differences between the two conditions, i.e. female preponderance and presence of post exertional malaise, a marked aggravation of symptoms after exercise, in CFS/ME [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the difference in Trp levels observed in lymphoma survivors with or without CF (mean values 73.4 &#x003bc;M and 77.6 &#x003bc;M, respectively), were also seen when comparing patients with CFS/ME (mean concentration 73.4 &#x003bc;M) to healthy age matched individuals (77.8 &#x003bc;M) [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For the other amino acids tested, the lymphoma survivors resemble more closely the healthy control subjects of the latter study, irrespective of a diagnosis of CF or not [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Compared to their non-fatigued counterparts, survivors with CF are characterized by metabolic changes that may be associated with a low grade inflammatory status. The essential amino acid Trp is the precursor of melatonin and serotonin, and has received much attention in investigations of depression and other psychiatric disorders [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Trp is mainly catabolized along the kynurenine pathway that produces intermediate compounds, collectively referred to as kynurenines, with a variety of effects, including neuro- and immunomodulation [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Metabolites of the kynurenine pathway also serve as precursors for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis and thereby play a role in energy homeostasis. The hepatic enzyme tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and the more widely expressed indolamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO) 1 and 2 catalyze the oxidative cleavage of Trp to Kyn, the first and rate limiting step of the pathway [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The ratio of Kyn to Trp has been proposed as a marker of these enzymatic reactions, but other factors, especially the activity of downstream enzymes metabolizing Kyn are also important in determining the Kyn/Trp ratio [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Both TDO and IDO have been implicated in a variety of disease states, including cancer and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Of note, TDO activity in liver may be induced by cortisol and IDO and other enzymes of the kynurenine pathway may be activated by proinflammatory cytokines such as Interferon&#x003b3;, IL-6 or TNF&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227384.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We found that the Kyn/Trp ratio in all lymphoma survivors analyzed was significantly correlated with other markers of immune activation and inflammation, such as measurable levels of IL-6, neopterin and CRP. There was a trend towards higher Kyn/Trp ratios in survivors with CF but the difference did not reach the predefined significance level. We also found trends for different levels of two intermediates in the kynurenine pathway (HK and HAA), suggesting that the lower Trp level in serum of survivors with CF possibly is associated with altered flux through this pathway. Apparently, this pathway may also be site for gender-specific effects, as the effect on HK primarily was driven by the female patients (p = 0.04) whereas the effect on HAA primarily was associated with male patients (p = 0.07). Such effects may be explained by specific effects on the enzymes involved in this pathway, and changes in the different metabolic routes kynurenine may take. In summary, it can be speculated that low grade immune activation and inflammation cause a metabolic shift involving increased drainage of Trp from blood, through effects on the kynurenine pathway. Changes in kynurenine metabolism and elevation of the Kyn/Trp ratio are also found in chronic diseases where low grade inflammation is assumed to be essential in the pathogenesis, such as cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and depression [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, we observed changes in the metabolism of vitamin B6 in fatigued lymphoma survivors. PLP, the active vitamer, serves as a cofactor for more than 150 enzymes including several of the enzymes involved in the kynurenine pathway. In recent years, the important function of vitamin B6 homeostasis in inflammation and immune responses in humans has attracted much interest [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Circulating concentrations of PLP show inverse correlations with risk and severity of a variety of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, all conditions in which inflammation is believed to play a key role in pathogenesis or disease progression. Blood levels of PA, the catabolite of PLP, seem positively correlated to markers of immune activation. Thus the index PAr, i.e. PA/(PL+PLP), has been introduced as a robust marker that reflects key processes related to an individual&#x02019;s vitamin B6 homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The PAr index is less influenced by smoking, renal function and vitamin B6 intake compared to levels of individual B6 vitamers, and is reported to discriminate efficiently patients with a high inflammatory state [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We found that survivors with CF had significantly higher PAr values than non-fatigued individuals, and that the PAr values where positively correlated with other markers of immune activations, such as measurable levels of IL-6, neopterin, CRP and the Kyn/Trp ratio.</p><p>Analyzing the same cohort of lymphoma survivors, we have previously reported that detectable levels of IL-6 in serum are independent determinants of CF [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The high correlation of IL-6 levels and both Kyn/Trp ratio, PAr index and neopterin indicate that the metabolic changes we describe are reflective of inflammation and/or immune activation in survivors with CF. PAr index was associated with the risk of CF in multivariate analysis when used independently of the other markers of inflammation or immune activation.</p><p>The association of indicators of low-grade inflammation and symptoms of CF does not allow a conclusion as to the causal direction. It could be that inflammatory processes induce fatigue in a subset of survivors, but alternatively, secondary effects of being fatigued may result in similar metabolic changes. For instance, it could be hypothesized that activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in survivors with CF may contribute to inflammation and cortisol induced TDO activation in the liver.</p><p>The changes in Trp, Kyn/Trp and PAr index in CF reported herein are novel observations and hypothesis generating, and as such, need to be validated in independent cohorts of cancer survivors. Before validation, important limitations in our observations need to be acknowledged. Our cohort consists of large number of survivors after high dose therapy for lymphoma only, all in remission at the time of analysis. The cohort is still heterogeneous in terms of lymphoma entities, additional therapy for lymphoma relapse after high dose therapy and in terms of other medical complications after treatment. The metabolic changes observed do not appear to be useful for development of diagnostic tests, neither alone nor in combinations. All differences of individual levels of amino acids, their metabolites or B6 vitamers were modest and concentrations in both fatigued and non-fatigued survivors were mostly within the normal range. There was also considerable overlap between the groups of survivors in each of the metabolites of interest, both Trp levels, Kyn/Trp ratios, individual levels of different kynurenins and the PAr index. Repeating the analyses for differences between fatigued and non-fatigued survivors after omitting possible outliers by the interquartile range rule, did however not alter the conclusion; levels of Trp, alpha-ketoglutarate and the PAr Index remained significantly associated with CF and Kyn/Trp ratios were of borderline significance only. Furthermore, we have analyzed only serum levels, and analyses of other compartments, such as intracellular levels in specific organs or cells, or other extracellular compartments such as cerebrospinal fluid, may be more informative. Due to the complex interplay of metabolic and immune pathways, more sophisticated analyses of a number of different markers together, such as network analyzes, may also be warranted [<xref rid="pone.0227384.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227384.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Amino acid concentrations in lymphoma survivors.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227384.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227384.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Arginine and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites in lymphoma survivors.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227384.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227384.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Metabolites of kynurenine pathway in lymphoma survivors.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227384.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227384.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Neopterin and metabolites of vitamin B6 in lymphoma survivors.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227384.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227384.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Logistic regression analyses with chronic fatigue as dependent variable.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227384.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227384.s006"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>Correlations of neopterin (A) and kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (B) with PAr index (ratio of 4-pyridoxic acid divided by sum of concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxal) in survivors.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227384.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227384.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Servaes</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Verhagen</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bleijenberg</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>Fatigue in cancer patients during and after treatment: prevalence, correlates and interventions</article-title>. <source>Eur J Cancer</source>. <year>2002</year>;<volume>38</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>27</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>43</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/s0959-8049(01)00332-x</pub-id>

</p><p>Response to review comments to the author</p><p>Reviewer #1: This is a well written research article with a clear experimental approach and well-presented results. The research area is indeed an interesting area with minimal data available.</p><p>Response: Thank you. We appreciate the recognition of our work.</p><p>Here are two comments/questions for the authors:</p><p>1. As IFN-y and TNF-alpha are shown to be potent inducers of the pathway, do the authors have data on these cytokines in patient&#x02019;s blood? It will definitely be interesting to see if there is any correlation between these cytokines and activation of this pathway.</p><p>Response: We have analyzed TNF alfa, IL-1RA and IL-1Beta in this cohort and reported that previously (Smeland KB et al, 2019, reference 22). Neither TNF alpha nor IL-1 Beta are correlated with the presence of CF, and these cytokines are not considered in this paper. Only IL-1R alpha is correlated with fatigue. Both PAr index, Kyn/Trp ratio and neopterin are significantly correlated with the level of IL-1RA in this cohort. We have added these data in Table 1 and a separate paragraph in the result section.</p><p>2. Does the author have data on the melatonin/serotonin pathway? This is so as tryptophan is the substrate for both the melatonin and kynurenine pathway.</p><p>Response: Unfortunately, we don&#x02019;t have these data. As for IFN-&#x003b3;, we agree that this would be interesting.</p><p>Reviewer #2: In this paper, the authors report decreased levels of circulating tryptophan in chronically fatigued versus non fatigued cancer patients, associated with changes in metabolites of B6 and trending changes in neopterin. Despite its cross-sectional nature the study is a priori interesting as it includes many more patients than what is usually the case in clinical studies of cancer-related fatigue. Unfortunately the study does not hold to its premises because of a number of major weaknesses. </p><p>1. Although the reported study is presented as exploratory it fails to adjust for multiplicity to account for the multiple statistical tests carried out in the same patients, which therefore gives limited credibility to the results that are reported. This is made even more problematic by the lack of any post hoc power analysis. </p><p>Response: In deed, we view our analyses as exploratory and in need of validation it other cohorts of cancer survivors with CF. This is clearly stated in the manuscript. The design of the study was to test whether we could find similar changes in metabolites in CF as in CFS/ME patients previously reported by our group. We did not find these patterns of amino acid changes, despite a reasonably large number of patients with or without CF. As such; the study is negative and clearly stated as such in results and discussion. These differences to CFS/ME are however in themselves important as they may point to different disease mechanisms. </p><p>The only finding that is confirmed when comparing across studies CFS/ME patients and cancer survivors with CF are the lower values for tryptophan. The analyses of the kynurenine pathway and the vitamin B6 metabolites are conducted in an effort to explain these differences, i.e. they are explanatory. As they all point in similar directions, i.e. implicate low grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of CF, we believe the data deserve to be presented at such awaiting formal validation in the future.</p><p>When it comes to post hoc power analyses, we believe that stating mean differences, standard deviations and p-values of appropriate (parametric or non-parametric tests) allow for assessment of possible type II errors, that is the risk that there are differences that would be statically significant in larger data sets. Post-hoc power analyses are in our view alternative ways to present the same information. For a broader discussion of the value of post-hoc power analyses our statistician has referred to the following web-site which we as clinician-scientists found useful to remind us of this fact.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2014/12/observed-power-and-what-to-do-if-your.html">http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2014/12/observed-power-and-what-to-do-if-your.html</ext-link></p><p>2. Concerning the significance of the observed changes, there are several issues that are not considered including nutritional status and possibility of activation of TDO rather than IDO to account for the observed differences in TRP and KYN. </p><p>Response: We have done a number of analyses to look at nutritional status and vitamin supplements and find that these do not influence the results. This is clearly stated in the manuscript as it is. </p><p>The origin of the proposed increased metabolism though this pathway is not known. It could be IDO or TDO, a hepatic enzyme differently regulated than IDO 1 and 2. We have added sentences in the discussion to discussion to incorporate the role of TDO in view of recent findings and clarifying reviews by experts in the field.</p><p>3. Note that figures 1 to 3 show the existence of outliers that probably drive the differences between fatigued and non-fatigued individuals. Apparently the authors did not attempt to assess whether their results remain identical if the outliers are excluded. </p><p>Response: We do not fully agree that there are obvious outliers in most of the analyses done. We have however repeated the analyses presented for Trp, alpha-ketoglutarate, Kyn/Trp ratio, Neopterin and PAr index related to presence of absence of CF, and related to measurable IL-6 levels after excluding potential outliers by the interquartile range rule. This excludes up to 2 % of the patients from the analyses, depending on which univariate test we are looking at. The results remain stable, that is Trp is significantly reduced and both alpha ketoglutarate and PAr index both significantly increased in patients with CF compared to non-fatigued survivors. For neopterin and Kyn/Trp ration the values remain borderline with p-values of 0.06-0.12. The association with measurable IL-6 as presented in Figure 4 remains highly significant for all comparisons despite omitting the most extreme values at both ends. These data are not presented.</p><p>4. In discussion of the trending results the authors omit to consider the possibility of reverse causality, i.e., "stress"-related fatigue causing low grade inflammation (or HPA axis activation) which itself would be responsible for activation of the kynurenine pathway.</p><p>Response: We agree that this could be the case and we have added a paragraph about reverse causality in the discussion, also including a potential role of cortisol induced TDO activity.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Alexander Foss&#x000e5;</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227384.s007"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to reviewers PLOS one.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227384.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0227384.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227384.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Guillemin</surname><given-names>Gilles J.</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Gilles J.
