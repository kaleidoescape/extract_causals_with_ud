With a focus on the isolation of plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria with ability to alleviate N stress, representative strains that were found at population densities greater than 10<sup>4</sup> cells g<sup>-1</sup> and that could grow in N-free semisolid media were isolated from soils under different management conditions and from the roots of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) and lulo (<italic>Solanum quitoense</italic>) plants that were grown in those soils. A total of 101 bacterial strains were obtained, after which they were phylogenetically categorized and characterized for their basic PGP mechanisms. All strains belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum in the classes Alphaproteobacteria (61% of isolates), Betaproteobacteria (19% of isolates) and Gammaproteobacteria (20% of isolates), with distribution encompassing nine genera, with the predominant genus being <italic>Rhizobium</italic> (58.4% of isolates). Strains isolated from conventional horticulture (CH) soil composed three bacterial genera, suggesting a lower diversity for the diazotrophs/N scavenger bacterial community than that observed for soils under organic management (ORG) or secondary forest coverture (SF). Conversely, diazotrophs/N scavenger strains from tomato plants grown in CH soil comprised a higher number of bacterial genera than did strains isolated from tomato plants grown in ORG or SF soils. Furthermore, strains isolated from tomato were phylogenetically more diverse than those from lulo. BOX-PCR fingerprinting of all strains revealed a high genetic diversity for several clonal representatives (four <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species and one <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species). Considering the potential PGP mechanisms, 49 strains (48.5% of the total) produced IAA (2.96&#x02013;193.97 &#x003bc;g IAA mg protein<sup>-1</sup>), 72 strains (71.3%) solubilized FePO<sub>4</sub> (0.40&#x02013;56.00 mg l<sup>-1</sup>), 44 strains (43.5%) solubilized AlPO<sub>4</sub> (0.62&#x02013;17.05 mg l<sup>-1</sup>), and 44 strains produced siderophores (1.06&#x02013;3.23). Further, 91 isolates (90.1% of total) showed at least one PGP trait, and 68 isolates (67.3%) showed multiple PGP traits. Greenhouse trials using the bacterial collection to inoculate tomato or lulo plants revealed increases in plant biomass (roots, shoots or both plant tissues) elicited by 65 strains (54.5% of the bacterial collection), of which 36 were obtained from the tomato rhizosphere, 15 were obtained from the lulo rhizosphere, and 14 originated from samples of soil that lacked plants. In addition, 18 strains showed positive inoculation effects on both <italic>Solanum</italic> species, of which 12 were classified as <italic>Rhizobium</italic> spp. by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, the strategy adopted allowed us to identify the variability in the composition of culturable diazotroph/N-scavenger representatives from soils under different management conditions by using two <italic>Solanum</italic> species as trap plants. The present results suggest the ability of tomato and lulo plants to enrich their belowground microbiomes with rhizobia representatives and the potential of selected rhizobial strains to promote the growth of <italic>Solanum</italic> crops under limiting N supply.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the INCT - Plant Growth-Promoting Microorganisms for Agricultural Sustainability and Environmental Responsability (INCT-MPCPAgro), Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Arauc&#x000e1;ria (conv. no. 309/2012), CNPq (conv.

Among the different tools available to increase productivity in agriculture, the use of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) has demonstrated great potential to achieve the goal of sustainability. PGPB can directly contribute to plant nutrition and can alleviate the detrimental effects caused by biotic and abiotic stresses to which field crops are subjected; PGPB can also indirectly improve soil fertility and quality by at least partially substituting for the use of chemical inputs [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite the large number of studies reporting the advantages of the use of PGPB as inoculants within commercial agricultural crops, their use as a regular agricultural practice on nonleguminous crop species is still underexplored in comparison with the amount of agricultural lands annually cultivated worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Major constraints for the broad use of plant growth-promoting bacterial inoculants are due to poor knowledge about the variability in the structure, composition and function of the plant microbiome subjected to the influence of plant genotypes on different soil microbial communities and edaphoclimatic conditions. Therefore, studies focused on the ecology, physiology and biochemistry of plant-microbe interactions are needed to deepen the understanding of the microbiome role in plant fitness and to facilitate the development of highly effective biological inputs for agriculture. In this sense, the application of culture-dependent methods to study plant-bacterium interactions can provide resources to elucidate the ecological and physiological role of plant microbiome representatives <italic>in vitro</italic> and determine their effects when present within host plant [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The rhizosphere, which is defined as a thin soil layer close to the root system and is actively influenced by metabolic activity [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], has often been used as the preferential site for the isolation of PGPB with potential applications as biofertilizers [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The habitat of rhizospheric soils differs physically, chemically and biologically from the nonrhizospheric soils (or bulk soil) because of the continuous release of a complex array of organic-based molecules such as rhizodeposits [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Qualitative and quantitative variations in rhizodeposits are thought to play an active role in shaping the rhizosphere microbiome by enriching population sizes of microbial representatives with competence to consume released compounds according to the plant genotype, age and local environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The modulation of the microbial community of plant holobionts is not stable over time because different biotic and abiotic conditions normally occur throughout the plant life cycle, and these variations may produce greater impacts than the genomic content on the qualitative and quantitative composition of rhizodeposits [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other biotic and abiotic factors, such as the native soil microbial diversity, physical and chemical soil properties and geographic and climatic conditions, also play important roles in shaping the composition and function of rhizosphere microbiomes [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In general, the bacterial diversity found in the rhizosphere is represented mainly by species belonging to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla, where the most common genera reported include <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter</italic>, <italic>Arthrobacter</italic>, <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, <italic>Azospirillum</italic>, <italic>Azotobacter</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, <italic>Flavobacterium</italic>, <italic>Cellulomonas</italic> and <italic>Micrococcus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Several bacteria from these phylogenetic clades are reported to have the ability to benefit plant growth and hence are considered PGPB, although the establishment of functional relationships between plants and representatives from the soil microbiome indicates coevolutionary requirements [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The influence of a given plant growth-promoting bacterial strain on plant development and growth succeeds via complex chemical crosstalk responsible for eliciting, in general, multiple PGP effects that involve direct and/or indirect growth-promoting mechanisms. Direct growth-promoting mechanisms involve the facilitation of nutrient acquisition or modulation of development by interfering in the balance of endogenous plant hormones, while indirect growth-promoting mechanisms are related to biocontrol, increased resistance against stresses and the modulation of plant gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The development of plant growth-promoting bacterial bioinputs ultimately requires the collection of rhizocompetent strains and the elucidation of their role in plant growth and health, their resilience as a holobiont component and their ecological relationships within the plant rhizosphere, where important plant-plant growth-promoting bacterial associations occur. In this sense, the present study describes the isolation, identification and characterization of culturable bacteria that are diazotrophic or have an N-scavenging ability and that were obtained from soils under different management conditions or from the roots plus the rhizosphere soil of tomato and lulo plants grown in these same soils. The PGP mechanisms of the isolated strains were characterized, aiming to identify those with potential for use as bioinputs targeted to alleviate N stress. Moreover, this study also aimed to address whether changes in the diversity of the target bacterial groups studied were related to soil management practices and/or the plant species used as traps for bacterial isolation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Soil characterization and sampling</title><p>Soils under three different management conditions were collected from the 0 to 10 cm depth from the experimental farm of Universidade Estadual de Londrina (Londrina, Parana, Brazil; 23&#x000b0;20&#x02019;31&#x0201d;S, 51&#x000b0;12&#x02019;38&#x0201d;W), aiming to assess microbial communities with distinct structural compositions. The management conditions included a secondary forest with no agricultural use for at least 35 years (SF), a site under intensive horticultural cropping with conventional management practices (CH) and a site under intensive horticultural cropping with organic management (ORG) practices. The conventional management site received macronutrients (NPK, 15-15-20, 100 g m<sup>-2</sup>) and micronutrients (FTE BR-12, 20 g m<sup>-2</sup>) every three months, while the organic site was regularly supplemented with organic compost produced from cow dung (2 kg m<sup>2</sup>). All soil samples were collected at geographically close sites (~400&#x02013;600 m distance) and were classified as Oxisols (Latossolo Vermelho Eutrof&#x000e9;rrico, Brazilian classification), with a high clay content (78%).

The pots were sown with three surface-disinfested seeds [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cv. Santa Cruz Kada Gigante, Topseed, Santo Antonio da Posse, Brazil) or lulo (<italic>Solanum quitoense</italic> Lam., kindly provided by the Experimental Station Vila Anamaria, Londrina, Brazil). In total, six different conditions were established to obtain diazotrophic/N scavenger isolates: combinations of the three soil conditions and the two <italic>Solanum</italic> species, with three replicates each. The plants were grown under greenhouse conditions in a random experimental design, and at 15 days after sowing, the seedlings were thinned to one healthy plant per pot for an additional growth period of 30 (tomato) or 60 (lulo) days, with tap water used to water the pots every two days. After the growth period, the plants were gently removed from the pots and shaken to remove loosely adhered soils from their roots. Unwashed roots (roots with tightly adhered rhizospheric soil) from both tomato and lulo plants (TR and LR treatments) were collected from each replicate, and 1 g samples were taken from the middle third of root systems and used to obtain homogenates in sterile saline solution (0.85%), following serial dilutions (up to 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) of sterile saline solutions. Samples from soils under the different management conditions were also subjected to isolation of diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria concomitantly with the establishment of the plant growth experiment to obtain a picture of the diversity and population sizes of these microbial groups in the absence of plants. To this end, 10 g samples from each soil condition were transferred to sterile Petri dishes, to which 2 ml of sterile distilled water was added; afterward, the dishes were incubated at 28&#x000b0;C for 48 h to restore microbial activity, using three replicates for each soil condition. After incubation, the samples were transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks (250 ml volume) supplemented with 90 ml of sterile saline solution, incubated under orbital shaking (180 rpm for 30 min) and then serially diluted (up to 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) in sterile saline solutions.</p><p>Isolation of diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria was performed according to the methods of Baldani et al.

Briefly, aliquots of 0.1 ml of relatively strong dilutions (10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) of all samples were inoculated into vials containing 5 ml of semisolid N-free media (JMV, JNFb, NFb, LGI or LGI-P) and incubated for seven days at 28&#x000b0;C. After the incubation period, the vials with a veil-like pellicle near the surface of the culture medium were considered positive for the presence of diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria. A loopful was taken from the pellicle of each culture medium and used to inoculate fresh N-free semisolid media of the same type; this step was repeated three more times to assure the ability of isolates to grow in the N-free culture media. After confirmation of growth in the N-depleted culture media, the population densities of diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria were determined by estimating the most probable number (MPN) following purification of the strains from the strongest dilutions, after which they were stored at -20&#x000b0;C for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA for each bacterial isolate was extracted according to the methods of Cheng and Jiang [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] using bacterial biomass obtained after growth in DYGS liquid media [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for 48 h and incubation at 28&#x000b0;C under 180 rpm on an orbital shaker Tecnal TE-424 (Piracicaba, Brazil).

The first was <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain 23S, which was isolated from ORG soil and showed potential to solubilize AlPO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub> and produce siderophores, resulting in increases in the SDW of tomato and lulo as well as an increase in the RDW of lulo plants. The second was <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. strain 26S, which was isolated from ORG soil, showed potential for solubilizing AlPO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub> and induced increases in the RDW of tomato and lulo as well as increases in the SDW of lulo.

growing population subjected to limited natural resource availability as well as growing pressure from climate change over food and feed production, effective and environmentally friendly solutions driven to ensure food safety and energy supplies must be identified and implemented. Current agricultural practices are responsible for large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) resulting from the use of oil-based inputs in large and increasing amounts, and environmental harm can potentially occur from the misuse of agrochemicals [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Conversely, natural mechanisms involved in plant nutrition and plant protection against biotic and abiotic stresses can be associated with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), which have been shown to be a sustainable alternative as substitutes, at least in part, for the use of agrochemicals [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this context, microbiological culture-based approaches for the search of plant-associated bacteria with PGP functions and functional and ecological studies of these microbial groups can provide a basis for the development of novel biological inputs for agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The present manuscript followed this route to partially reveal the biodiversity of diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria that are associated with different <italic>Solanum</italic> species (tomato and lulo) and soils under different management conditions and that are found at population densities greater than 1x10<sup>4</sup> cells g<sup>-1</sup> (in both plant tissue and the soil).</p><p>The isolated bacterial strains were previously treated in this study as diazotrophs or N scavengers because N-free media allow the growth of bacteria with the ability to scavenge traces of nitrogen sources such as NH<sub>3</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O from the atmosphere [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and because nitrogenase activity and the expression of its related genes were not assessed in the isolated strains. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that nitrogen fixation ability, or at least the presence of structural nitrogenase genes, has been reported for all the genera identified in the present study except for <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> sp. strain 4S, whose identification diverged between <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> according to the RDP classifier and BLAST/SILVA database information, respectively. Culture-based approaches using N-free culture media have been successfully used to estimate populations of diazotrophs in association with different plant species and environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Although they are in limited range for proper descriptions of microbial community structures in complex environments such as soils and plant roots, culture-dependent methods are of great importance for detecting low-abundance microbial phylotypes and for performing intense studies of the ecological and physiologic roles of specific strains in a given ecosystem [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>As holobionts, individual plants have evolved to interact with microorganisms and somehow developed mechanisms to increase the population size of specific microbial groups in the vicinity of the roots; these microbes are recruited from the soil microbiome as part of a phenomenon known as the rhizosphere effect [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Furthermore, different soils and plant genotypes, in addition to the chosen method to assess the biodiversity of representative bacteria from soil and root ecosystems, may result in different pictures of the structure and composition of microbial communities associated with plants [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the present work, the use of N-free semisolid culture media to assess diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria revealed variations in the isolation frequency of the targeted microbial groups according to the isolation source (BS, TR or LR) and the native microbial community (SF, CH or ORG soils). The rhizosphere effect imposed by different <italic>Solanum</italic> species suggests a preference of both plant species to increase the population size of representative <italic>Rhizobium</italic> strains in the rhizosphere, at least under the tested conditions. This was evidenced by a higher isolation frequency of <italic>Rhizobium</italic> in the TR and LR samples compared to the BS samples, regardless of the soil management conditions under which the plants were grown and the type of N-free semisolid culture medium used in the isolation procedure. Rhizobia are best known to develop symbiotic interactions with legumes, where mutualistic relationships progress to modifications of the root architecture of the host plant by the formation of nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Nevertheless, nonsymbiotic and even parasitic rhizobial strains can be found in abundance in rhizosphere and nonrhizospheric soils, and the resulting plant-rhizobium interaction can be determined by the genetic content of both partners and environmental pressure [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>In fact, the pool of <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species comprises several representatives originally isolated from samples other than legume nodules, including endophytes and rhizosphere-colonizing species isolated from plants in the Araceae, Asteraceae, Convallariaceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, and Solanaceae families (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bacterio.net/rhizobium.html">www.bacterio.net/rhizobium.html</ext-link>). As stated by Berge et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], the variability of environments and activities observed among species of rhizobia indicates the involvement of this group in &#x0201c;a broad range of functions in diverse ecosystems&#x0201d;. The findings reported here indicate that <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species can be selectively increased in population size in association with tomato and lulo plants, as evidenced by the increased isolation frequency of <italic>Rhizobium</italic> strains from plants grown in soils with no history of legume cropping, such as the SF soil. Several studies have demonstrated that <italic>Rhizobium</italic> can develop associative relationships with nonleguminous plants with the potential for used as PGPB, although the molecular basis of such interactions is still poorly understood [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, colonization of <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> by <italic>Rhizobium</italic> has been scarcely reported, and the bacteriome of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>quitoense</italic> remains unexplored. Studies based on NGS have shown the presence of Rhizobiales as a component of the tomato microbiome, even as the main phylogenetic group in the endosphere of roots [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Furthermore, Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales, Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales and Xanthomonadales have been described as predominant Proteobacteria orders that colonize tomato roots [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], while several diazotrophic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species were found in tomato plants grown in fields in Mexico [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p><p>The question raised in response to the high frequency of <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species isolated from <italic>Solanum</italic> plants observed in the present work is whether these strains are components of the native soil microbiome or are derived from anthropogenic environmental interventions, such as legume cropping or the use of commercial rhizobial inoculants. According to the phylogenetic relationships between the representative <italic>Rhizobium</italic> isolates and the <italic>Rhizobium</italic> type strains, we observed isolates that clustered close to rhizobial species that are commonly used as inoculants (<italic>R</italic>. <italic>freirei</italic> cluster), although such strains encompassed approximately 6% to 29% of the total rhizobia isolates depending on the stringency adopted to consider distinct phylogenetic clusters. Further, the high genomic diversity revealed by BOX-PCR fingerprinting suggests that the isolates do not represent a homogeneous evolved group, as would be expected if they were related to human-selected strains for use as inoculants. The phylogenetic positioning of the <italic>Rhizobium</italic> strains isolated from soils (strains 03S, 11S, 13S and 18S) away from the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>freirei</italic> cluster also suggests that native soils were not heavily colonized by strains used as commercial inoculants. The genetic diversity and community structure of rhizobia, which are natural microsymbionts of legumes, are commonly studied using a given leguminous plant as a trap plant, following the isolation of bacteria from nodules and their further characterization (genetic, functional, and phenotypic characterization). Such studies suggest that selective enrichment of rhizobial strains from the pool of the rhizobial community in the soil occurs based on symbiotic compatibility (gene background) with the plant, and depending on the plant used, the biodiversity of isolates can be restricted [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p><p>Attempts to identify efficient plant growth-promoting bacteria from representative isolates of a given plant microbiome generally begin with the <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of PGP traits exhibited by the candidate strain, although this method is controversial because the bacterial metabolism is modulated according to environmental conditions, including plant feedback [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Nevertheless, significant correlations between <italic>in vitro</italic> bacterial traits and the respective inoculation response are commonly reported in the literature, including those used to suggest which mechanism of growth-promoting is predominant in plant-bacterium associations [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. From the set of direct mechanisms that PGPB can use to enhance plant growth, the biosynthesis of phytohormones such as IAA has been reported to play a major role due to its effects on root architecture and, consequently, on the acquisition of water and nutrients by plants [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The ability to solubilize P forms has recently been raised as a target trait for bacterial inoculants because, in most soils, the soluble P amount is low and because phosphates are a nonrenewable mineral resource needed for plant nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Most P-solubilizing bacteria act on inorganic secondary P minerals such as calcium, iron and aluminum phosphates by releasing adsorbed P by the production of organic acids or by the mineralization of organic P forms [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Another important trait from associative bacteria involved in the promotion of plant growth is the production of siderophores, which are believed to play a role in direct and indirect mechanisms of growth promotion by increasing iron availability for plant nutrition and by reducing its availability to pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, no positive or significant correlation resulted between the PGP traits determined <italic>in vitro</italic> and the plant biometric parameters; instead, significant and negative correlations resulted between the lulo growth and the AlPO<sub>4</sub> solubilization and siderophore production by diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria. As AlPO<sub>4</sub> is described as a highly insoluble chemical P form, bacterial metabolism related to AlPO<sub>4</sub> solubilization may also implicate a strong decrease in the pH of the colonization site. Although the pH of the solutions used to test for AlPO<sub>4</sub> solubilization was not addressed in this work, a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain described as effective at solubilizing AlPO<sub>4</sub> can reduce the pH of culture media from 7,0 to below 4,0 in two days, without producing organic acids [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Considering that most strains with a positive effect on biomass accumulation in tomato have shown potential to solubilize FePO<sub>4</sub>, this trait is suggested to be relevant for the observed responses. Furthermore, while some strains for which none of the PGP traits were observed (P solubilization, IAA and siderophore production) caused increased tomato and lulo biomass, other PGP traits such as N supply may have also played important roles in the observed inoculation effects, even more so considering that plants were under N starvation. In fact, due to the complexity of the biotic and abiotic interactions that influence plant growth and physiology and, consequently, the plant-plant growth-promoting bacterium molecular crosstalk, in addition to the variability of phylogenetic groups and their respective metabolic needs, the identification of mechanisms involved in plant growth promotion by a given plant growth-promoting bacterial strain is not trivial [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>A comparative analysis of plant growth-promoting bacterial genomes carried out by Cai et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] highlighted common genetic features of 151 plant-associative bacteria (both pathogenic and beneficial strains), supporting the hypothesis for the convergent evolution of different bacterial taxa to select genes involved in the colonization of plant hosts and development of compatible (specific) interactions. Although limited in range over the bacterial biodiversity of plant microbiomes, the genomic diversity, isolation frequency and population sizes of diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria presented in our study demonstrate that soil communities differ from those in association with <italic>Solanum</italic>, suggesting that recruitment of compatible strains from the soil microbiome by the plants occurred. In addition, the structure and composition of diazotroph/N scavenger bacterial communities differed between tomato and lulo, and these plant species showed a contrasting overall response to the inoculation, where several strains resulted in decreases in tomato biomass, while the opposite was observed for lulo. The data in the literature on the identification and selection of PGPB have no consensus with respect to the best strategy to be used in the search for elite bacterial strains, although a common thread reported is the importance of the use <italic>in vivo</italic> trials to select for growth-promoting bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In this same sense, autochthonous plant growth-promoting bacterial strains are believed to have relatively high potential in eliciting growth-promoting effects, which is in accordance with the evolutionary and specific needs for successful chemical crosstalk, despite variations in this specificity being vastly reported [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].</p><p>Among the 63 total diazotrophic/N-scavenging strains that promoted increases in tomato and/or lulo biomass (RDW, SDW or both) reported here, those isolated from TR samples were predominant (34 strains), suggesting that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>lycopersicum</italic> is more efficient than <italic>S</italic>. <italic>quitoense</italic> at selecting PGPB from the soil microbiome. On the other hand, only a few strains showed a positive inoculation effect on tomato (28 strains, 17 autochthonous ones of tomato), while the biomass of lulo increased in response to the inoculation of a large number of strains (55 strains, 15 autochthonous ones of lulo); these results suggested that lulo is more easily influenced by PGPB than is tomato. Notably, strains ranked by the bonitur scale showing scores greater than 10 (the top 16 strains) caused increases in biomass for one or both <italic>Solanum</italic> species, indicating that this strategy fits well for the selection of candidates for additional inoculation experiments under field conditions. The best plant growth-promoting bacterial candidates included 8 <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species, 4 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> species, 3 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species and one <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> species, of which the strains <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. 23S and <italic>Cupriavidus</italic> sp. 26S were effective for both <italic>Solanum</italic> species and may have potential for applications in other horticultural crop species. The high number of <italic>Rhizobium</italic> strains isolated from <italic>Solanum</italic> plants at population densities greater than 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells g<sup>-1</sup> plant material raises important questions concerning the ability of representatives from this phylogenetic group to act as opportunistic or specific associative bacteria, which future genomic studies should answer. This study is the first report describing the isolation and characterization of bacterial representatives associated with lulo (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>quitoense</italic>) and their assessment as PGPB in association with this <italic>Solanum</italic> species. Previous studies have reported on root fungal communities associated with lulo plantations as well as the response of lulo to inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) [<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227422.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], but to date, no studies have investigated the association of lulo and diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria as growth promoters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227422.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships between the isolated strains described in the present study and the respective type species for each genus identified based on the alignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227422.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227422.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Chemical characteristics of soils used in this study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227422.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227422.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Number of diazotroph/N scavenger bacterial strains isolated from soils under different management conditions and from unwashed roots of tomato and lulo plants grown on those soils, according to findings in different semisolid N-free culture media.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227422.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227422.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Molecular characterization and plant growth-promoting traits of the 101 diazotroph/N scavenger bacterial strains described in this study and the respective ranking of their biotechnological potential to promote the growth of <italic>Solanum</italic>, according to the bonitur scale.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227422.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227422.s005"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Plant growth-promoting mechanisms of the 101 diazotroph/N scavenger bacterial strains described in this study.</title><p>The means plotted in the same color represent groups that do not significantly differ at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 according to the Scott-Knott algorithm.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: The article "Diversity and plant growth-promoting functions of diazotrophic/N-scavenging bacteria isolated from the soils and rhizospheres of two species of Solanum" is a culturomics study on the rhizosphere of two related plant species in three different agricultural management. On top of it, the authors carried a phenotypic characterization of the 101 isolated strains and genomic fingerprinting. This article has a clear experimental design and the methods are adequate to the questions. The results are well detailed and the discussion is a critical analysis of the results in light of the literature.</p><p>In my opinion, this article meets the criteria for a direct acceptance, as I could not find any major or minor revision to be applied.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Alzate Zuluaga and co-workers presents the intensive isolation of promising PGPB strains with potential biotechnological features and their characterization for the PGPR traits and their in vivo activities.</p><p>the research is well designed and conducted; the results are well presented and discussed in the frame of the existing relevant literature.</p><p>In my opinion, the manuscript is suitable to be published in POLOS ONE. However, while reading, I was able to spot several imperfections in the English writing, therefore I suggest the authors to have their manuscript revised by a native English speaker before submitting the final version for publication.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
