Moreover, CGA increased the activity of SOD and the level of GSH, as well as decreased production of ROS and LDH and the accumulation of MDA. Notably, CGA attenuated oxidative stress-induced brain injury and apoptosis and inhibited the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9). Additionally, CGA reversed CI/R induced inactivation of Nrf2 pathway and promoted Nrf2, NQO-1 and HO-1 expression.

It is worth noting that after treatment with different doses of CGA (20, 100 and 500 mg/kg), the activities of SOD and GSH in CI/R rats were increased, while the contents of LDH, MDA and ROS were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that CGA alleviates oxidative stress induced by CI/R in rats.<fig id="F0003" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>CGA alleviates oxidative stress induced by CI/R in rats.

As shown in <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, hippocampal neurons in the control group and CGA group were structurally complete and closely arranged. The nuclei were normal, and the nucleoli were clear with a uniform staining. However, in the CI/R group, the structure of hippocampal neurons was severely damaged, with nuclear deformation, shrinkage, hyperchromia and even disappearance. Besides, the cells were loosely arranged and began to form cavities. It is worth noting that CGA treatment improved the structural damage of hippocampal neurons induced by CI/R and reduced the cavity structure in rats. In addition, TUNEL staining showed that the number of brown labeled apoptotic cells in CI/R group was significantly higher than that in control group and CGA group. Notably, CGA treatment prevented cortical cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, Western blotting analysis showed that CI/R treatment promoted the expression of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9. On the contrary, CGA treatment abolished the promotional effect on the expression of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

As shown in <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, the expression of Nrf2 pathway proteins (Nrf2, NQO-1 and HO-1) was significantly inhibited in CI/R rats. However, levels of Nrf2, NQO-1 and HO-1 were dose-dependently up-regulated after treatment with different doses of CGA (20, 100 and 500 mg/kg). The Nrf pathway inhibitor ML385 (10 &#x003bc; M) further confirmed that Nrf2 pathway was involved in the role of CGA. As shown in <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, protein levels of Nrf2, NQO-1 and HO-1 in healthy rats treated with ML385 alone were significantly lower than those in the control group.

Interestingly, CGA treatment reversed the decrease in CI/R-induced Nrf2 pathway-associated protein expression, whereas ML385 aggravated the inactivation of the Nrf2 pathway. Further functional experiments showed that ML385 aggravated CI/R-induced neuronal injury, apoptosis and oxidative stress in rats.

Interestingly, CGA reactivated Nrf2 pathway and promoted Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1 expression, which further increased SOD activity and reduced MDA level. In addition, CGA inhibited the apoptosis of cerebral cortex cells by reducing CI/R-induced oxidative stress and alleviated the brain pathological damage. As expected, Nrf2 pathway inhibitor ML385 destroyed the effect of CGA on CI/R and exacerbated CI/R-induced pathological damage. Overall, these results suggest that CGA appears to be protective in CI/R rats by regulating pathways related to oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study elaborated the role of CGA in CI/R in rats and its underlying molecular mechanisms.
