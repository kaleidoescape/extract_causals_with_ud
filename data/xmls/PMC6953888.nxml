Yet, the nature and abundance of any viruses carried by these divergent eukaryotic parasites is unknown. We investigated the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> virome by performing a meta-transcriptomic analysis of blood samples taken from patients suffering from malaria and infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> or <italic>P</italic>. <italic>knowlesi</italic>. This resulted in the identification of a narnavirus-like sequence, encoding an RNA polymerase and restricted to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viva</italic>x samples, as well as an associated viral segment of unknown function. These data, confirmed by PCR, are indicative of a novel RNA virus that we term Matryoshka RNA virus 1 (MaRNAV-1) to reflect its analogy to a "Russian doll": a virus, infecting a parasite, infecting an animal. Additional screening revealed that MaRNAV-1 was abundant in geographically diverse <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> derived from humans and mosquitoes, strongly supporting its association with this parasite, and not in any of the other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> samples analyzed here nor <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes in the absence of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Notably, related bi-segmented narnavirus-like sequences (MaRNAV-2) were retrieved from Australian birds infected with a <italic>Leucocytozoon</italic>&#x02014;a genus of eukaryotic parasites that group with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in the Apicomplexa subclass hematozoa. Together, these data support the establishment of two new phylogenetically divergent and genomically distinct viral species associated with protists, including the first virus likely infecting <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. As well as broadening our understanding of the diversity and evolutionary history of the eukaryotic virosphere, the restriction to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> may be of importance in understanding <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic>-specific biology in humans and mosquitoes, and how viral co-infection might alter host responses at each stage of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> life-cycle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>While parasites are a major cause of human disease, they can themselves be infected by viruses. We asked whether three of the major malaria-causing parasites in humans&#x02014;<italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>knowlesi</italic>&#x02014;were also infected by viruses. To this end we performed total RNA-Sequencing (&#x0201c;meta-transcriptomics&#x0201d;) on human blood samples infected with these <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. This resulted in the discovery of an abundant bi-segmented virus&#x02014;Matryoshka RNA virus 1 (MaRNAV-1)&#x02014;in all <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> samples tested (but no other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species) that contains a replicase segment related to those of narnaviruses, arguably the simplest type of RNA viruses discovered to date. By screening for MaRNAV-1 in a larger set of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species we revealed a strong specificity between this virus and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic>, as well as the presence of a related virus&#x02014;MaRNAV-2&#x02014;in avian <italic>Leucocytozoon</italic> hematozoa parasites. This is the first discovery of a <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-associated virus and will assist in revealing the deep evolutionary history of RNA viruses and our understanding of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> biology and disease processes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>1138860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4751-1831</contrib-id><name><surname>Davenport</surname><given-names>Miles P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>FL170100022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9596-3552</contrib-id><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>Edward C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>1037304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anstey</surname><given-names>Nicholas M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>1045156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anstey</surname><given-names>Nicholas M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>1042072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anstey</surname><given-names>Nicholas M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an Australian Research Council Australian Laureate Fellowship awarded to ECH (FL170100022), the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (grants #1037304 and #1045156; Fellowships to NMA [#1042072] and MJG [#1138860]), and the Australian Centre of Research Excellence in Malaria Elimination.

Although there has been an expansion of metagenomic studies dedicated to exploring this immense virosphere [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], our knowledge of the viral universe remains limited, with only a minute fraction of eukaryotic species sampled to date [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This knowledge gap is especially wide in the case of unicellular eukaryotes (i.e. protists), including those responsible for parasitic disease in humans, on which only a small number of studies have been performed.</p><p>Viral-like particles in parasites were first observed by electron microscopy as early as the 1960&#x02019;s in various protozoa from the apicomplexan and kinetoplastid phyla [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The first molecular evidence for the existence of protozoan viruses was obtained in the late 1980s, resulting in the characterization of double-strand (ds) RNA viruses in the human parasites <italic>Giardia</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic>, <italic>Trichomonas</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More recently, single-stranded narnavirus-like and bunyavirus-like RNA viruses were identified in trypanosomatid parasites, including <italic>Leptomonas seymouri</italic>, <italic>Leptomonas moramango</italic>, <italic>Leptomonas pyrrhocoris</italic> and <italic>Crithidia</italic> sp. [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, our knowledge of protozoan viruses is clearly limited, with many of those identified stemming from fortuitous discovery.</p><p>The identification and study of protozoan viruses is also important for our understanding of so-called &#x0201c;Russian doll&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;Matryoshka&#x0201d; in Russian) infections [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in which parasites are themselves infected by other microbes. A key question is whether viruses of parasites can in turn have an impact on aspects of parasite pathogenesis? An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that dsRNA viruses of protozoa can affect key aspects of parasite biology, including their virulence, in a variety of ways [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For instance, data from <italic>Leishmania guyanensis</italic> and <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> strongly suggest a link between parasite pathogenesis and the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) and Trichomonas vaginalis virus, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. By increasing the inflammatory response in the host these viruses could in theory enhance human pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Interestingly, associations have also been observed between LRV1-infected <italic>L</italic>. <italic>guyanensis</italic> or <italic>L</italic>. <italic>braziliensis</italic> and treatment failure in patients with leishmaniasis [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Viral co-infection also has the potential to alter protozoan biology and/or attenuate the mammalian host response, leading to greater replication or persistent protozoan infection, in turn promoting ongoing parasite transmission. Persistence (i.e. avirulent infection) has been proposed in the case of Cryptosporidium parvum virus 1 (CSpV1) that infects the apicomplexan <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and increased <italic>C</italic>. <italic>parvum</italic> fecundity has been demonstrated in isolates experiencing viral co-infection [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Viral infections may also have a deleterious effect on parasite biology, adversely impacting such traits as growth and adhesion in the case of axenic cultures of <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clearly, the effects and underlying molecular basis of any consequences that protozoal viruses have on their hosts, including in the context of pathogenesis, requires rigorous investigation. Documenting novel protozoal viruses is an obvious first step in this process.</p><p>Remarkably, nothing is known about those viruses that infect species of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (order Haemosporida)&#x02014;obligate apicomplexan parasites of vertebrates and insects. In vertebrate hosts, these protozoa first infect the liver cells as sporozoites where they mature into schizonts. Resulting merozoites are then released into the bloodstream to undergo asexual multiplication in red blood cells.

ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The mapping of Pv-reads against this newly-described viral-like genome revealed that the virus-like contig was highly abundant in the Pv library, comprising approximately 1.6% of all reads (from which rRNA has been excluded) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008216.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A more detailed characterization of this virus is presented below. To detect homologs to this newly identified RNA-virus-like contig in the other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, DN5867 contigs were used as the reference for another round of BLASTx: this analysis revealed no matches in either the Pf or Pk data sets.</p><p>The apparent bias in virus composition between libraries likely reflects differences in their virome composition rather than experimental bias, since the quality of samples, the depth of sequencing, and the contig assembly were similar among the four libraries. However, it is also possible that it in part reflects the limits of BLASTn/BLASTx sequence-based homology detection methods to identify highly divergent RNA viruses. To help overcome this limitation, and try to identify any highly divergent RNA viruses, we performed a BLASTn/BLASTx search on the contigs using the nt and nr databases, respectively. Assuming that RNA virus-like genomic sequence would be of a minimum length set to 1000 nt (as there are no RNA viruses shorter than this), and to make the analysis computationally tractable, only the &#x0201c;orphan&#x0201d; contigs (i.e. those without any match in any of the nt or nr databases) longer than 1000nt were used for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008216.s011">S3 Fig</xref>). To identify remote virus signal from these sequences, a second round of BLASTx search was conducted with lower levels of stringency: this revealed no clear hits to RNA viruses.</p><p>Finally, we employed a structural-homology based approach to virus discovery, utilizing information on protein 3D structure rather than primary amino acid sequence, as the former can be safely assumed to be more conserved than the latter [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and is therefore predicted to be better able to reveal distant evolutionary relationships. Accordingly, hypothetical ORFs were predicted from orphan contigs and Hidden Markov model (HMM) searches combined with 3D-structure modelling were performed on the corresponding amino acid sequences using the Phyre2 web portal [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

To the best of our knowledge this is the first documented RNA virus associated with the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and more broadly in parasites of the Apicomplexa subclass hematozoa. An additional investigation of complementary data sets from the SRA similarly provided strong evidence for the presence of MaRNAV-1 in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic>, but not in any of the other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species analyzed. Similarly, MaRNAV-1 was absent from <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-free <italic>Anopheles</italic> species.

Finally, we documented closely related-viral sequences&#x02014;MaRNAV-2&#x02014;in avian samples infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-related <italic>Leucocytozoon</italic> parasites. The divergent nature of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Leucocytozoon</italic> viruses identified here, including the presence of a second genome segment, raises the possibility that they should be classified as a new genus or into a larger family together with LepseyNLV1.</p><p>The first segment of MaRNAV-1 encodes a single ORF containing the conserved RdRp-motif that is related to those found in the <italic>Narnaviridae</italic>, while the second segment, which is not characteristic of narnaviruses, encodes two overlapping ORFs of unknown function. The family <italic>Narnaviridae</italic> comprises a capsid-less viral family that infects plants, fungi and protists. Interestingly, no sequences associated with fungi were observed in our samples, again compatible with the idea that this virus is indeed associated with <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. In addition, the closest RNA virus homologs were also observed in protozoans, or in arthropods that could conceivably be infected by protozoan parasites [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

As RNA viruses normally exhibit high rates of evolutionary change [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the recognizable sequence similarity between the narna-like RNA viruses from <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (Alveolates, Apicomplexa) and <italic>Leptomonas</italic> (Euglenozoa, kinetoplastids) means it is perhaps unlikely that they shared a common ancestor that lived approximately two billion years ago (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008216.g008">8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008216.g009">9</xref>). Some Euglenozoa and Alveolates independently evolved a parasitic lifestyle by infecting invertebrates and, more recently, vertebrate hosts. Hence, it is more likely that the protozoan narnavirus-like similarities reflects viral cross-species transmission between two protozoan parasites during mixed-infection in either vertebrate or invertebrate hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008216.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). The wide distribution and prevalence of MaRNAV-1 in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> populations, as well as in the different species of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites investigated previously, supports the idea that this host jumping event is relatively ancient, although the exact time-scale is difficult to determine. As previously demonstrated, invertebrates play a key role in RNA virus evolution by feeding on many different hosts and transmitting viruses, fungi and protozoa among both plants and vertebrates [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

Further investigation of the origins and functions of these hypothetical proteins clearly need to be conducted to better understand the virus biological cycle and its evolutionary history. Indeed, capsid-less elements cannot exist in an extracellular state and are necessarily transmitted via intracellular mode (cell division or cell mating) [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Narnaviridae</italic> comprise some of the simplest viruses described to date, containing a single segment encoding a single replicase. Despite this, they are still able to impact their hosts in profound ways. For example, a reduction in host virulence (hypovirulence) has been documented in the case of mitoviruses (a genus of <italic>Narnaviridae</italic> infecting fungi) [<xref rid="ppat.1008216.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

Intuitively, the biological consequences of the high prevalence of this virus in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic>-infected individuals will represent an important avenue for future research. More broadly, the characterization of the viral cycle of MaRNAV-1, their biology, and interactions with its host may also help to understand the biology and life-cycle of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> parasites, as well as the modulation of host and parasite responses leading to immunoevasion, pathogenesis and transmission. Similarly, additional study of those Pv-infected samples that do not carry MaRNAV-1 may reveal some of the possible impacts of viral infection on parasite biology.

</p><p>Dear Dr. Holmes:</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Novel RNA viruses associated with Plasmodium vivax in human malaria and Leucocytozoon parasites in avian disease" (PPATHOGENS-D-19-00967) for review by PLOS Pathogens. Your manuscript was fully evaluated at the editorial level and by two independent peer reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic but identified some aspects of the manuscript that should be improved.</p><p>While both reviewers consider your discovery of an RNA virus in Plasmodium vivax and Leucocytozoon parasites&#x000a0;important and well supported by the data, reviewer 1 points to the exclusively&#x000a0;sequencing-based nature of the evidence and would like to see additional experimental work&#x000a0;that the viral polymerase or RNA is actually present within the parasite. At one level,&#x000a0;we&#x000a0;agree with the reviewer and think that such additional data would add a very relevant&#x000a0;new&#x000a0;dimension to your work by allowing the new virus to be localised unequivocally within the parasite. We ask you to consider adding such data, in particular since the in situ hybridisation approach using RNAscope reagents should be highly sensitive and could be executed within a matter of weeks.&#x000a0;On the other hand we recognise&#x000a0;that some of the work suggested by reviewer 1 would take considerably more&#x000a0;time and we would rather like to see you deal with some of their concerns in the discussion, rather than&#x000a0;delay resubmission of your manuscript substantially, given that both reviewers consider your major conclusions broadly supported by different lines of evidence.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p>In any case, we ask you to modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations before we can consider your manuscript for acceptance. Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer.</p><p>In addition, when you are ready to resubmit, please be prepared to provide the following:</p><p>(1) A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.&#x000a0;Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>(2) Two versions of the manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p><p>While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com</ext-link>.&#x000a0;PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email>figures@plos.org</email>.</p><p>We hope to receive your revised manuscript within 60 days or less. If you anticipate any delay in its return, we ask that you let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email.</p><p>[LINK]</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns while you make these revisions, please let us know.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Oliver Billker</p><p>Associate Editor</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>Raul Andino</p><p>Section Editor</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>Kasturi Haldar</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>&#x0200b;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5065-158X">orcid.org/0000-0001-5065-158X</ext-link></p><p>Grant McFadden</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2556-3526">orcid.org/0000-0002-2556-3526</ext-link></p><p>***********************</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Part I - Summary</bold></p><p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p><p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript describes the detection of a narnavirus-like sequence in RNA-seq data obtained from Plasmodium vivax-infected individuals. This virus is found at a relatively high viral load, has a friendly segment at a similar copy number, and is only associated with P. vivax infection. Narnaviruses have been found in protozoa before, but there's been no virus associated with plasmodium - narnaviruses have typically been considered lame viruses in the world of viral discovery since they were thought to have no structural proteins, but that may require reconsidering with the discoveries of second segments associated with these viruses. The use of SRA data to better link host and virus is a strong addition to the work and very helpful.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript reports the identification of MaRNAV-1, a narnavirus-like bisegmented sequence that encodes a conserved RNA polymerase in its first segment, and two unidentified ORFs in its second segment, in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. The authors used a meta-transcriptomic study of blood samples from patients with P. vivax, P. falciparum and P. knowlesi, and confirmed their finding through mining of RNA-seq datasets P. chabaudi, P. cynomolgi, P. falciparum, P. yoelli, P. knowlesi and P. berghei available in public databases. Additionally, reference assisted alignments using the MaRNAV-1 sequences on Australian birds infected with Leucocytozoon, discovered MaRNAV-2. This parasite is a distant relative of Plasmodium but it belongs to the same Apicomplexa subclass hematozoa.</p><p>These are the first two RNA viruses reported to infect hematozoa and thus this manuscript represents a highly interesting and novel finding. It also broadens our understanding of viral evolution in eukaryotic microbes, while revealing the possibility of host-pathogen-viral interactions that could be important for our understanding of the P. vivax parasite. However, there are several instances of missing data and text, and overall the paper's claims and description could be made a lot tighter.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold></p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1: The data presented here are very intriguing and the authors are most likely correct, but my enthusiasm is tempered by the lack of biological experiments to 1) conclusively associate the host-virus relationship, 2) test for presence of nucleic acid or protein in the parasites themselves, or 3) to extend understanding of the second segment. It&#x02019;s not just the revenge of the wet-lab folk; it&#x02019;s important when doing less controlled &#x02014; dare we say, descriptive &#x02014; studies of human infections, as other viral discoveries have this problem, especially in vector-borne diseases where the vector may be carrying multiple viruses or protozoa and/or they may be in areas where multiple vectors exist. There are opportunities to go beyond the initial detection of the virus described here in this report.</p><p>Probably most germane is #2 above. Can the authors raise antibody to the viral polymerase and show it is present within the parasite and/or perform RNAscope and show that the segments are generally within the parasite?</p><p>Also worthwhile would be to conclusively show that the virus is not present in different species of Anopheles mosquitos when P. vivax is not present, as that is the most likely confounder for these types of metagenomic studies in human specimens who have been bitten by so many vectors (again the SRA data is nicely done here, but it is not clear that it is adequately sampling different Anopheles vectors).</p><p>Farther along the line, despite the difficulty of P. vivax culture, it would be important to see if the virus can grow with P. vivax in vitro for a handful of cycles; or one could obtain material from controlled human infections with vivax to see if the virus persists.</p><p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part III &#x02013; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold></p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1: line 334 - I think given the bioinformatic and RNA detection focus of this paper, there's an opportunity to get more hints at the biology from some analysis of the P. vivax libraries that did NOT have MaRNA-1 in them.</p><p>line 159 - would put a unit on the parasitemia numbers.</p><p>line 421 - would mention LepseyNLV1 here since it also has two segments and is narna-like. One would expect that if you</p><p>line 443 - it is not clear that the same rapid evolutionary rates hold for narnaviruses.</p><p>Figure 2 - pity to have all that computational knowledge and firepower, but can't get an agarose gel to run straight or rotate an image...</p><p>Figure 3 - I did not see the authors conjectures as to why there is so much divergence in Pv#2 in RdRp compared to other viruses, and why there is more divergence in the RdRp compared to the second segment.</p><p>Figure 4 - I did not see a mention of the reads to MaRNA-1 in P. cynomolgi or other Plasmodium in the text...</p><p>Figure 7 - unclear labels in the legend.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Main comments</p><p>1. Table 2 is missing from the manuscript, referred to in lines 204 and 221. Apparently it contains important information on the RNA virus-like contigs, such as their length and abundance (RPKM), but this information was not available for review.</p><p>2. Figure 2a, Plasmodium falciparum gel image: This figure appears to be composed of 3 different gels, one for each of the amplicons. The left side of the gel for the Human RPS18 lacks a MW ladder, which makes the sizes of the amplicons unclear. So we are unable to confirm the validity of this figure.</p><p>3. Does P. vivax infect Anopheles gambiae? It's unclear what the relevance of undertaking dinucleotide composition analysis of this species of mosquito is, if it's not routinely a vector of Pv</p><p>Minor comments</p><p>1. Figure 1A is confusing, and requires additional information to explain the filtering of the dataset. Lines 165 and 166 mention that the number of reads filtered from the non-infected, Pf, Pk, and Pv data sets were 93%, 81%, 42%, and 57% respectively. Figure 1A shows bar graphs that represent the efficiency of read filtering, or the number of reads remaining once a specific type of sequence is filtered (i.e., w/o Human, w/o rRNA, and w/o Plasmodium). Shouldn't the percentage of reads filtered (reported on Lines 165 &#x00026; 166) be equal to the combined proportion of the number of reads filtered for all the filtering criteria in Figure 1A? Based on read numbers taken from Figure 1A, we can calculate the total percentage of reads kept after filtering for each of the individual conditions (w/o Human, w/o rRNA, or w/o Plasmodium). For example, Pv read numbers after filtering on Figure 1A show that the percentage of reads left after individual filtering are as follows: w/o Human = 43%, w/o rRNA = 35.49 %, and w/o Plasmodium = 4.5%. If we subtract the percentage of the category with the most reads filtered from the raw percentage of reads (100%), we get the value reported for the percentage number of filtered reads reported on lines 165 &#x00026; 166. For Pv this calculation would be (100% Raw Pv reads)-(43% Pv reads left w/o Human)=(57% reads filtered for Pv). However, this calculation for total proportion of filtered reads does not account for cases in which the dataset is being additionally filtered using the other two filtering criteria with lower percentages (in the case of Pv: w/o rRNA = 35.99% and w/o Plasmodium= 4.5%). Given that all libraries on Figure 1A follow the same patterns of percentages of reads left after filtering and filtering criteria (i.e. w/o Human = (highest percentage), w/o rRNA = (percentage somewhere between Highest and lowest), and w/o Plasmodium = (lowest percentage)), it suggests that filtering is occurring sequentially and not in parallel for each of the filtering criteria. If this is the case, the figure legend should be changed perhaps to the following:</p><p>a. (black) Raw reads</p><p>b. (grey) Trimmed reads</p><p>c. (blue) w/o human.</p><p>d. (yellow) w/o Human and w/o rRNA</p><p>e. (orange) w/o Human, w/o rRNA, and w/o Plasmodium.</p><p>2.
