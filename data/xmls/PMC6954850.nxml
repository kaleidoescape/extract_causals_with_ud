After classifying the health literacy distribution as quintiles, the analysis revealed a dose&#x02013;response relationship with OHA initiation that plateaued at the third and fourth quintiles and declined at the fifth quintile. Individuals residing in communities with higher health literacy were more likely to participate in preventive care services (relative risk ranged from 1.09 for lipid test [95% CI 1.07&#x02013;1.11] to 1.43 for flu shot [95% CI 1.41&#x02013;1.46]).</p></sec><sec id="S2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Community-level health literacy estimates were associated with the initiation of OHA and uptake of standard preventive care services in older adults.

Timely use of antihyperglycemic agents and standard preventive care is important among these high-risk patients to prevent diabetes complications and comorbidities.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Clinical guidelines stress the importance of assessing medical, functional, mental, and social determinants of health to improve diabetes management in older adults.<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Health literacy, defined as one&#x02019;s ability to obtain, process and understand the information needed to make health decisions, has been shown to influence patient health behaviors, chronic disease self-management, and communication with clinicians.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Yet challenges related to health literacy measurement have limited investigation of the complex relationship between health literacy, health behaviors and health outcomes. Commonly used individual-level health literacy assessments can be time- and resource-intensive; in most cases, they are not be feasible for administration on a broad scale. As a result, most health literacy studies have had small sample sizes and have been underpowered to assess the association between health literacy and treatment use/care and clinical outcomes or endpoints.<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>While generally measured at the individual level, health literacy reflects not only individual-level skills but also how well health systems provide services to vulnerable populations.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It can also be conceptualized as a community-level characteristic, capturing the average health literacy of individuals living within a specified geographic area, and may provide an alternative solution for conceptualizing and estimating health literacy. Health behaviors and other health-related decisions do not occur in isolation, but are often influenced by community factors and input. Thus, one&#x02019;s community health literacy level may also influence whether and how a patient obtains, interprets and applies health information, as well as how healthcare is accessed and used.</p><p>Recently, a method of estimating the community-level health literacy of US census block groups was developed and validated by our research team.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The estimates of community-level health literacy have been mapped throughout the US.<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, few, if any, studies have examined the role of community-level health literacy on patient health behaviors and outcomes. Such a study may help provide insights on the use of community-level health literacy as a more cost-effective mechanism for identifying communities or neighborhoods of individuals who may be at increased risk for complications related to diabetes, which could help promote and target public health efforts. Therefore, using this novel measurement approach, this study aimed to investigate the associations between community-level health literacy estimates and the initiation of oral antihyperglycemic agents and the use of standard preventive care in a national cohort of older adults with hypertension and newly diagnosed diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Data Sources and Study Cohort</title><p>The primary data sources used for this study were Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) research files from 2007 to 2011, which included all Medicare patients that met chronic conditions criteria for type 2 diabetes for the first time in 2008 and were previously diagnosed with hypertension. The final analytical cohort included patients who met the following inclusion criteria: 1) had type 2 diabetes diagnosis in 2008 (first type 2 diabetes diagnosis was considered index diagnosis); 2) lived in the United States with a valid residential ZIP code; 3) were 66 years of age at the time of index diagnosis; 4) lived at least 1 day after type 2 diabetes diagnosis date; and in the 12-month baseline period had: 5) no type 2 diabetes diagnosis; 6) no fills for anti-diabetic medications; 7) no end-stage renal disease (ESRD); and 8) a diagnosis of hypertension. <underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=211784.docx">Figure A1</ext-link></underline> shows the details of the cohort selection process.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Community-Level Health Literacy</title><p>Community-level health literacy was estimated at the US census block group level using an approach developed by our team.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Our model was based upon work by Martin et al, who used linear regression and data from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) and 2000 US Census to predict the mean health literacy score of individuals living in a US census tract.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The predictor variables are the same between the original model and our model but we modified the model to predict health literacy at the census block group level for greater precision. Specifically, the model uses the following predictor variables: gender, age, race/ethnicity, language spoken at home, income, education, marital status, time in the US, and metropolitan statistical area. We used the 2010 US Census Summary File 1 to create the gender, age, race/ethnicity variables at census block group level and the 5-year (2006&#x02013;2010) American Community Survey (ACS) Summary File to create the variables of language spoken at home, income, education and marital status at census block group level. Time in the USA was entered as a census tract level variable from the ACS Summary File, as no aggregated statistics at block group level were available for this variable.

We applied a modified Poisson regression model with robust error variance to estimate risk ratios (relative risk) to model the probability of receiving each of the preventive care services within 12 months post index diagnosis.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We chose this modified Poisson model, rather than survival analysis, to analyze these outcomes as we sought to relate community-level health literacy to patients&#x02019; behavior to seek preventive care in general, instead of by timing, which could be affected by having received these services in the not too distant past. Additionally, clinical guidelines do not specify precisely how soon patients should receive these services post diagnosis, but rather how often (i.e., fasting lipid profile to be measured annually).<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>In sensitivity analyses, we assessed whether controlling for primary care physician shortage in local areas affected the association between estimated community-level health literacy and the investigated outcomes.

The adjusted hazard ratios for other quintiles compared to the first quintile were as follows: second quintile (1.10, 95% CI 1.06&#x02013;1.14), third quintile (1.19, CI 1.15&#x02013;1.24), fourth quintile (1.17, CI 1.13&#x02013;1.22), fifth quintile (1.06, CI 1.02&#x02013;1.10).

Compared to patients living in neighborhoods with low community-level health literacy, patients living in neighborhoods with higher community-level health literacy had higher rates of standard preventive care services within 12 months post new type 2 diabetes diagnosis. <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A&#x02013;D</xref> shows the estimated risk ratios (relative risks) that quantify the associations between different levels of estimated community health literacy and preventive care services received within the 12 months post diagnosis period. Patients from neighborhoods with above basic community-level health literacy were more likely to receive standard care diabetes services than were patients from neighborhoods with basic or below basic community-level health literacy. In the analyses by community-level health literacy quintiles, the increases in likelihood range from 9% (unadjusted, 95% CI 1.07&#x02013;1.11) and 5% (adjusted, 95% CI 1.03&#x02013;1.07) for lipid test to 43% (unadjusted, 95% CI 1.41&#x02013;1.46) and 24% (adjusted, 95% CI 1.22&#x02013;1.26) for flu vaccination. There was a strong dose&#x02013;response association between community-level health literacy and flu vaccination and a general trend of dose&#x02013;response association for an eye exam and lipid tests. Further, patients living in neighborhoods with high community-level health literacy had statistically higher chances of receiving HbA1c tests, although this increase plateaued by the fourth quintile.<fig id="F0004" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(<bold>A&#x02013;D</bold>) Associations between community health literacy levels and preventive care services within 12 months post new type 2 diabetes diagnosis.</p></caption><graphic content-type="print-only" xlink:href="PPA-14-1-g0004"/></fig></p><p>To address the concern that lower community-level health literacy is simply a proxy for disadvantaged or underserved areas, we conducted sensitivity analyses that included two physician shortage area covariates (i.e. whole or part of residential county designated as a primary care shortage area). Results showed that the effects of community-level health literacy on outcomes were not affected by the inclusion of these variables (<underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=211784.docx">Tables A1 and A2</ext-link></underline>). The two physician shortage variables, however, were statistically significantly associated with the initiation of OHA and flu vaccination, suggesting that physician shortage areas and community-level health literacy are capturing two distinct characteristics of the community.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Discussion</title><p>We examined whether a measure of community-level health literacy was associated with initiation of OHA and other standard preventive care services for diabetes. In our nationally representative study cohort of 169,758 older adults with hypertension and newly diagnosed diabetes, 14.5% of the study cohort lived in communities with basic/below basic health literacy.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Patients living in neighborhoods with lower community-level health literacy had more comorbidities and chronic conditions. Compared to the basic/below basic or first (lowest) quintile of the community-level health literacy estimates, higher community-level health literacy was associated with higher rates of OHA initiation and receipt of standard preventive care services.</p><p>The association between estimated community-level health literacy and the initiation of OHA is multifaceted, as the association across quintiles is not linear, but convex. Two different mechanisms may explain this pattern. First, patients living in neighborhoods with lower community-level health literacy may be less likely to receive timely and appropriate care, reflecting disparities in care. This may explain why our analysis showed increasingly higher rates of OHA initiation from the first quintile of community-level health literacy to the third quintile. Also, we speculate that this may be a reason that patients living in areas with lower community-level health literacy had low reported rates of hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism. They may have less screening or access to care for these diagnoses rather than an actual lower prevalence of these medical conditions. Second, it is important to note that when newly diagnosed with diabetes, patients are first encouraged to start life-style and diet changes for glycemic control before any initiation of OHA. Patients living in areas with higher community-level health literacy may not only be able to perform better self-care and to achieve a healthier diet and lifestyle due to their own health literacy, but such changes in self-care and lifestyle may be reinforced and supported by those in the broader community, such as nearby friends, family and neighbors, who also understand the importance of such changes. Thus, those living in communities with high health literacy may have better glycemic control and consequently a reduced need to initiate OHA earlier. This may explain why the OHA initiation rate plateaued at the third and fourth quintiles of community-level health literacy, followed by a markedly lower rate at the fifth quintile. Future studies will be needed to identify and understand how to overcome community-level health literacy barriers.</p><p>There was also a dose&#x02013;response association between community-level health literacy and a range of standard preventive care services evaluated in this study. However, the effect size and impact of community-level health literacy estimates on the respective standard preventive care services varied. Flu vaccination was the most affected by community-level health literacy, followed by HbA1c tests, eye exams, and lipid tests. Public health campaigns promoting flu vaccination are widespread, including messages around its importance and where to get one. Given the extensive literature linking individual-level health literacy to preventive care outcomes, it is reasonable to assume that more individuals in communities with higher average health literacy understand the importance of the flu vaccine, and not only received one, but encourage others in their community to do the same. Messaging around more diabetes-specific preventive care services may not be as pervasive in the community, which would result in less community-level knowledge and patient support to obtain these services. More research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and to test whether community-level health literacy may be a stronger predictor of more population-based health outcomes and the relative importance of community-level to individual-level health literacy for more specified clinical outcomes.</p><p>Other factors such as availability of health-care providers in an area may also influence treatment and standard preventive care use. In our sensitivity analysis, it was shown that area primary care physician shortage was associated with both the initiation of OHA and uptake of flu vaccination, but did not affect the association between estimated community health literacy and the studied outcomes. In this study, the strength of the associations between community-level health literacy eatimates and studied outcomes was attenuated after adjusting for patient baseline clinical characteristics. However, it may be reasonable to consider the baseline patient clinical characteristics as intermediaries rather than confounders. Since community-level health literacy was estimated cross-sectionally, and patients living in neighborhoods with low community-level health literacy had more comorbidities and chronic conditions at baseline, lower community-level health literacy could be seen as an important contributor to the development of chronic conditions at baseline.</p><p>These findings have important implications for research and practice. First, results suggest that community-level health literacy may be an important factor to consider in patient education efforts. Given that it is not feasible to comprehensively assess the health literacy of patients or a community on a broad scale, community-level health literacy estimates may provide a simpler and more cost-effective approach to identifying populations, or areas, that may benefit from additional support or education. Our team has provided community-level estimates of health literacy for almost all census block groups across the United States. This data is publically available, free of charge, on a university-hosted website.<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Community partners and other organizations may use this information to better target public health efforts. Secondly, community-level health literacy has other unique strengths from a research perspective. Specifically, estimates can be linked to large health-care utilization databases, providing sufficient statistical power to assess the association between health literacy and various treatment and care services use, as well as endpoint health outcomes. Studies that utilize this methodology may also be able to help address important questions about the relationship between health literacy and population health and health policy issues, which otherwise will not be possible to investigate in smaller-scale research studies that rely upon the individual-level measurement of health literacy.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Despite the strengths of our approach, there are limitations that should be noted. The community-level health literacy variable is constructed as a mean health literacy estimate for all residents in a US census block group and is therefore unable to differentiate individual literacy skills within a community. Variation in outcomes contributed by between-individual variation within a community may be poorly explained by variation in the community health literacy estimates. Nonetheless, our previous study shows a good agreement between the community-level health literacy estimates and results from individual literacy assessments.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Additionally, individual patient health beliefs may affect treatment use and care access. Our study did not have measures for individual patient beliefs.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study showed notable associations between estimated community-level health literacy and the initiation of OHA and the use of standard preventive care services in a national cohort of older adults with hypertension and newly diagnosed diabetes.
