However, geometric morphometric studies have demonstrated clear differences among the skull shapes of various mice strains. The question now arises: why are skull shapes different among the mice strains? Epigenetic processes, such as morphological interaction between the muscles and bones, may cause differences in the skull shapes among various mice strains. To test these predictions, the objective of this study is to examine the morphological association between a specific part of the skull and its adjacent muscle. We examined C57BL6J, BALB/cA, and ICR mice on embryonic days (E) 12.5 and 16.5 as well as on postnatal days (P) 0, 10, and 90. As a result, we found morphological differences between C57BL6J and BALB/cA mice with respect to the inferior spine of the hypophyseal cartilage or basisphenoid (SP) and the tensor veli palatini muscle (TVP) during the prenatal and postnatal periods. There was a morphological correlation between the SP and the TVP in the C57BL6J, BALB/cA, and ICR mice during E15 and P0. However, there were not correlation between the TVP and the SP during P10. After discectomy, bone deformation was associated with a change in the shape of the adjacent muscle. Therefore, epigenetic modifications linked to the interaction between the muscles and bones might occur easily during the prenatal period, and inflammation seems to allow epigenetic modifications between the two to occur.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>JP18K17180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamamoto</surname><given-names>Masahito</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research (nos. 90733767: M.

Most inbred laboratory strains have originated from a limited founder population of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>domesticus</italic> housed within a few research facilities and laboratories [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most of these strains have been bred for over 150 generations and are isogenic and homogeneous for over 98.6% of their genomes [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, geometric morphometric studies have revealed clear differences with respect to the skull shapes of various mice strains [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227301.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the underlying reasons for the differences in the skull shapes among various mice strains remain unclear.</p><p>Ever since Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution in the book titled <italic>On the Origin of Species</italic> in 1859, researchers in the field of evolutionary developmental biology have sought to unravel the mechanisms of evolution of phenotypic variations. By the end of the 20th century, the researchers had identified the specific genes and allelic variants that adapt to phenotypic variations [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, genotypic characterization alone does not explain all the phenotypic variations in natural populations. In 1940&#x02013;1950, before the golden age of evolutionary genetics, Conrad Waddington had already described the extragenetic factors that contribute to phenotypic variations [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227301.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. He demonstrated that embryo fruit flies reared in a high-temperature environment have different wing structures than their counterparts in the control group. Subsequently, he selectively bred the fruit flies that displayed the new characteristics for several generations. Consequently, the progeny displayed the new characteristics even in the absence of the environmental stimulus. He defined this phenomenon as &#x0201c;Epigenetics,&#x0201d; which refers to the effect of internal and external interactions between the environment and genes on the evolution of the phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227301.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The term epigenetics encompasses the tissue&#x02013;tissue interactions, such as the effect of the muscle on the bone during their development and maintenance periods. The biomechanical interaction between the muscle and bone has typically been investigated in three types of studies, i.e., analyses of the correlation between muscle volume and bone size [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], comparisons of skull shapes between mice feeding on hard and soft diets [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227301.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and study of the effects of muscle atrophy on bone shapes [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227301.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As with the muscle&#x02013;bone interaction in adults, the bone shape is associated with the muscle-induced loading during the embryonic development period. Sharir et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that mice paralyzed due to muscular dysgenesis exhibit abnormal circular-shaped long bone diaphysis, which indicated the effect of <italic>in utero</italic> muscle load on bone development. Similar aberrant development of the shape of long bones was also observed in the studies of mice without muscles [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Particularly, Rot-Nikcevic et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] described that muscle defects had a noticeable effect on the morphology of the mandible. However, few studies have focused on the morphological interaction between the muscle and bone.</p><p>Illustrations and photographs in the anatomical textbooks show that skeletal muscles properly fit onto the surfaces of adjacent bone and other skeletal muscles. This is clearly observed in the cross-sectional images of the arm, thigh, head, or neck [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, our previous studies have suggested that muscle anlagen are already fitted onto the surface of the adjacent bone or cartilage analgen during the prenatal development [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, the interaction between the muscle and bone may affect their shape during the developmental period because the skeletal muscles properly fit onto the surfaces of adjacent bone for a lifetime, including in the fetal period [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Our findings showed differences between C57BL6J and BALB/cA mice with respect to the shape of a specific part of the skull and its adjacent muscle during the prenatal and postnatal periods. Differences in the shape of the skull and its surrounding muscles among the mice strains may result from epigenetic processes linked to the interaction between their adjacent parts. To test these predictions, we examined the morphological associations between the skull and its adjacent muscles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experiments related to mice were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of animals.

Denervation induces an immediate loss of skeletal muscle mass [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although reinnervation after long-term denervation may result in the partial recovery of muscle mass, it is typically not restored to the original state [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A recent study showed that signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) strongly exacerbated the effects of denervation and fasting [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, the authors concluded that BMP signaling, particularly Gdf5 (BMP14), was critical for the maintenance of muscle mass. Another study showed that BMP signaling pathway promoted skeletal muscle mass development and inhibited the wasting of denervated muscle [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, the combined inactivation of Spry1 and Spry2 in the temporomandibular joint was shown to promote muscle mass growth and hinder bone formation, thereby suggesting that Spry1 and Spry2 may regulate the muscle size [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We showed that the anterior TVP in the C57BL6J mice was larger than that in the BALB/cA mice at E15.5 and P0. It is possible that BMP signaling and the activities of Spry1 and Spry2 may regulate muscle mass in these strains.</p><p>Epigenetics means modification in gene expression that does not involve alteration in the underlying DNA sequence. The control mechanisms have been grouped in three classes: (1) DNA methylation, (2) histone modification, and (3) ncRNA interaction [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. DNA methylation is associated with the pluripotency and naive characteristics of stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], whereas DNA demethylation is the removal process of a methyl group from nucleotides, which is essential for cell fate decisions [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. During the development of muscle stem cells, specific-myogenic factors are activated in a demethylation-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Histone acetylation, which is one of the histone modifications, is also a major change that affects gene transcription. Histone acetylation and deacetylation regulate many steps of myogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) contribute to the molecular pathways and chromatin changes that regulate the tissue-specific gene expression during chondrocyte and osteoblast specification [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated a morphological correlation between the muscles and bones during E15 and P0. If the bone volume reduces in size, then DNA demethylation seems to promote the expression of specific-myogenic factors. On the contrary, if muscle volume reduces in size, then HDACs might control the chondrocyte maturation by regulating the expression of matrix genes. Since epigenetic information can be inherited across multiple generations [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], there might be differences in the TVP shapes between two mice strains at E12.5. In addition, we demonstrated that there were not correlations between the TVP and the SP at P10. Therefore, epigenetic modification between the muscles and bones seem to rarely happen during postnatal period.</p><p>Unilateral partial discectomy induces dramatic changes in the condylar cartilage in the surgical TMJ [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A study by Xu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed chondrocyte clusters to be appearing at 8 weeks after discectomy. Afterwards, fibrillation was observed at 12 weeks. In contrast, unilateral partial discectomy was shown to trigger the degeneration of the articular cartilage in the contralateral sham-surgical TMJ of mice. Choen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported that contralateral sham-surgical TMJs remained the same at 4 weeks after surgery, whereas the increased proteoglycan straining was observed at 8 weeks after the surgery. An incision was made in the subcutaneous and muscle layers on the contralateral side (sham surgery) [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227301.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, we did not perform the sham-surgical operation in the contralateral TMJ. This study retarded the progression of articular cartilage degeneration in the non-surgical contralateral side. Therefore, we used the contralateral TMJ as the control.</p><p>After discectomy, the size of the mandibular condyle on the discectomy side was greater than that on the non-surgical side, and the shape of the temporalis muscle on discectomy side had changed. Therefore, inflammation seems to allow epigenetic modifications between the muscles and bones to occur. Recently, reduced skeletal muscle mass and function, namely sarcopenia, is related to low areal bone mineral density, osteoporosis [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A combined diagnosis of sarcopenia and osteoporosis has been defined, namely osteosarcopenia, that is associated with increased risks of gait and balance disturbances and of fracture in elderly men. However, it is not clear whether one condition has more of a causal influence than the other or if both conditions have an equal impact. Hence, there is growing interest in the interaction between muscle and bone.</p><p>The effect of muscle loading on the skull shape depends on the tendon&#x02013;bone interactions [<xref rid="pone.0227301.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To observe pure muscle&#x02013;bone interactions without any tendon effects, we selected the area, wherein the muscle is in direct contact with the bone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research (nos.
