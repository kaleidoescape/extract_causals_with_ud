Although the underlying mechanism is unknown, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> may alter the gut microbiome. In the current study, 16S rRNA sequencing has been carried out using samples obtained from the cecum of broiler chickens exposed to diets comprising different tissue types (leaf and root) and varying amounts (0.3% and 0.5%) of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> to investigate their impact on gut microbiome. The microbiome composition in the groups supplemented with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> leaf varied from that of the control group. Especially, exposure to 0.5% amounts of leaf resulted in differences in the abundance of genera compared with diets comprising 0.3% leaf. Exposure to a diet containing 0.5% <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> leaf decreased the abundance of the following bacteria: <italic>Eubacterium nodatum</italic>, <italic>Marvinbryantia</italic>, <italic>Oscillospira</italic>, and <italic>Gelria</italic>.

Dietary components not digestible by host enzymes can be digested by gut bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, prebiotics such as inulin, polyphenol, and galacto-oligosaccharide are non-digestible food ingredients that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Such prebiotics increase the fermentation products produced by beneficial bacteria, which enhances host immune response [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Elucidation of the interactions between diet and microbiome has raised the interest in functional foods with beneficial effects on gut microbiome and host health [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Among the various functional foods, <italic>Allium hookeri</italic> is widely used as a health food that treat high blood glucose or lipid levels in patients with diabetes mellitus in Korea [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> belongs to the genus <italic>Allium</italic>, which includes <italic>A</italic>. <italic>cepa</italic> (onion) and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>sativum L</italic>. (garlic). <italic>Allium</italic> species have been used as medicinal foods to reduce the risk of several types of cancers by preventing mutagenesis [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The beneficial effects of <italic>Allium</italic> are attributed to the abundance of organosulfur compounds, polyphenols, and allicin [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> contains six-fold higher levels of organosulfur than garlic, and higher cellulose and total phenol contents than onion [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

In this study, we fed different feed supplements including <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> to six groups of 1,200 broiler chickens, each group comprising 200 chickens: Control, CS, Leaf 0.3, Leaf 0.5, Root 0.3 and Root 0.5. Four chickens from each of the six groups with their weights similar to the average weight of the group were selected. Twenty-four samples from six groups were used for sequencing. The impact of Leaf 0.5 on the altered gut microbiome in this study may corroborate our previous study, which highlighted improved growth traits in Leaf 0.5. Based on multiple analysis of gut microbiome and phenotype of broiler chickens, this study provides deeper insight into the relationship between the intake of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> Leaf, microbial communities and growth performance.</p><p>The remarkable effect of leaf on microbiome is attributed to the abundance of pharmacologically active components contained in leaves. Previous studies regarding <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> compared the concentrations of different ingredients in leaf with those of the root. Compared with the root, the leaf contains a higher number of polyphenols, estimated by the amount of total phenolics and flavonoids [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Polyphenol is an antioxidant that potentially prevents diseases related to oxidative stress, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A large proportion (~90%) of absorbable polyphenols are digested by gut microbiome rather than the digestive enzymes in the small intestine [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Microbial degradation of polyphenols generates intermediates including aglycones that promote various aromatic acid metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The altered metabolite composition may alter the prebiotic effects of microrganisms such as antimicrobial activities against pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Especially, the reduction of bacteria was observed only in chickens exposed to leaves, which showed higher levels of total phenolics (240.4&#x02013;276.6 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g) compared with the roots [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In broiler chickens, polyphenol-rich grapes showed increased <italic>Enterococcus</italic> levels but decreased levels of <italic>Clostridium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].The polyphenols in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> might play an important role in modulating microorganism composition, which explains the presence of unique microbial communities in the guts of chickens fed with polyphenol-rich leaves.</p><p>The altered abundance of bacteria following <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> leaf supplementation occurs at the generic level. Among eight leaf-associated genera, the abundance of <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> was increased in the Leaf 0.5 group. <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> are obligatory anaerobic bacteria that degrade saccharides, forming acetate and succinate as the major end-products [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Except for <italic>Parabacteroides</italic>, the abundance of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic>-associated genera decreased. The reduction in the abundance of most microbiomes may be associated with the antibacterial effect of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> leaf. The decrease in bacterial concentrations may be attributed to allicin, which accounts for the spicy flavor of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic>. Allicin is an organosulfur compound with characteristic antibacterial activity against a wide range of microorganisms including <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in several studies [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Its antibacterial activity is attributed to its chemical reaction with thiol groups of enzymes that influence the metabolism of cysteine proteinase activity related to bacterial virulence [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of antibacterial activity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> are not clear. Therefore, further evidence is needed to establish the relationship between the decreased abundance of microorganisms and the antibacterial activity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic>.</p><p>The effects of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> on crucial phenotypes of broiler chickens were investigated, given the importance of growth trait enhancement without antibiotics for growth promotion (AGPs) and to decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Other studies investigated feed supplements using natural foods including extracts from herb species, which enhanced poultry health by improving immunity and protecting chickens from avian diseases [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our previous study has shown that broiler chickens supplemented with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> show improved growth performance [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the present study, a subset of samples from our previous study was used [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The Leaf 0.3 and Leaf 0.5 groups showed higher body weights (P-value: 0.001 and 0.052, respectively) compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0226833.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). To determine whether the microbiome was related to greater body weight in chickens exposed to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> leaves and to identify the genera associated with body weights, the abundance of genera was correlated with body weight. Notably, the genera showing positive (or negative) correlation with body weight were relatively abundant (or depleted) in Leaf 0.3 and Leaf 0.5 groups, suggesting that alterations in microbiome induced by leaf exposure may affect the body weight. Specific genera related to body weight are known to be related to diet or energy metabolism in other studies. For example, <italic>Bacillus</italic> that showed negative correlation with body weight was associated with feed efficiency in broiler chicks [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. <italic>Clostridium sensustricto</italic> 1 showed a positive correlation with body weight. Family <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic> is known to induce weight gain in rex rabbits [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The association between increased body weight and microbiome is also supported by functional analysis. Results of functional analysis revealed that the chickens in Leaf 0.5 group showed enriched carbohydrate metabolism, which increased the body weight. In summary, the correlation between body weight and enrichment of carbohydrate metabolism suggests that altered communities of microorganisms induced by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> may alter the body weight.</p><p>The association between microbiome and other traits including bone strength and IBD antibody was also determined. Bone strength was examined because several bacteria improved calcium absorption [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. IBD antibody was investigated as an index of immune system related to microbiome [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Among five genera associated with bone strength, none of them was correlated with bone strength in previous studies. However, the genera associated with IBD antibody were consistent with or contrary to previous metagenome studies related to immune system or IBD. <italic>Lachnoclostridium</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> groups that were positively and negatively correlated with IBD antibody, respectively, were also involved in the inoculation of strongly virulent IBD virus in broiler chickens [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This finding indicates that these genera are strongly linked to the regulation of immune system.</p><p>Parasutterella, which showed a positive correlation with bone strength was also positively correlated with IBD. <italic>Parasutterella</italic> showed positive correlation with irritable bowel syndrome in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the role of <italic>Parasutterella</italic> in gut pathophysiology has yet to be discovered. We speculated that the association with bone strength and IBD in common genera might be explained by the relationship between immune and bone cells. The interaction is mediated via circulating blood cells containing T and B cells in bone marrow [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. T and B cells play important roles in cell-mediated immunity to regulate bone resorption and bone formation by producing large amounts of cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which explains the connection between bone and immune cells. A mouse study has revealed that gut microbiota regulate bone mass and immune status [<xref rid="pone.0226833.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Despite the association between specific genera and both traits, microorganisms known to control both bone mass and immune system were poorly detected. Thus, the genera detected in this study may provide a clue for this interaction. The small sample size is one of the study limitations; however, this is the first study to investigate the effect of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> on gut microbiome, despite several studies reporting its health benefits. Further studies are needed to determine the role of these genera in the interaction with immune system and bone strength.</p><p>In conclusion, our results showed the degree of alteration based on supplementation of <italic>A</italic>.<italic>hookeri</italic>, especially its leaf. The abundance of microorganisms was decreased in chickens exposed to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> leaves indicating that the leaf has a distinct effect on microbial communities. We also detected specific genera related to body weight, bone strength, and IBD antibody known to be important for productivity of broiler chickens. Therefore, the health benefit of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> in broiler chicken is mediated via its microbiome, suggesting that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>hookeri</italic> is a potential feed supplement for broiler chickens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Experimental protocol and procedures were approved by the Small Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (NAS201707).

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: The article has scientific merit. However, it needs some adjustments and some clarification.</p><p>The title should contain the word "root", not just leaf</p><p>Important information is missing from the summary as the main bacteria found, what were the main changes with the treatments. Still in the summary, the authors report that the main changes are involved with the 0.5% level, but I disagree, throughout the work it is possible to realize that 0.3% has a great impact on the results.In the conclusion of the summary it must be clear that the effect was of the leaf.</p><p>At the end of the introduction the goal needs to be clearer, it went far beyond the profile of the microbiota. Several correlations were presented that were also objective.</p><p>In line 128, the authors use the term microbes, the advised term is the microorganisms please note this throughout the text.</p><p>Data on the composition (profile) at the genus level should be showed for all treatments this will make it easier to understand figures 2b and 2c.</p><p>In the discussion, between lines 232 and 238 the authors report that A.hookeri has effect as a prebiotic, however, they do not make it clear.</p><p>But if it has prebiotic action what would be the leaf component responsible for this effect?And how much of this compound is in the leaf?</p><p>In line 251 boiler = broiler</p><p>In line 256 the authors report the following sentence "In the present study a subset of samples from our previous study was used" two points here are crucial. First: the methodology for performance analysis should be in the material and methods as well as bone and IBD results should be presented. What statistical analyzes were used for these data? Second: If these performance data were performed in a separate experiment; Correlation between the data is not feasible because we know that the microbiota is variable.</p><p>The discussion about the microbiota and its effect on performance, ibd and bones was short. We know that when the immune system is stimulated the impact on performance is negative. If Parasutterella stimulates the immune system, how can it be treated for performance?</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
