The fungus produces a much higher amount of MELs from vegetable oil than from glucose, whereas its close relative, <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> UM521, produces a lower amount of MELs from vegetable oil. In the present study, we used previous gene expression profiles measured by DNA microarray analyses after culturing on two carbon sources, glucose and soybean oil, to further characterize MEL biosynthesis in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34. A total of 264 genes were found with induction ratios and expression intensities under oily conditions with similar tendencies to those of MEL cluster genes. Of these, 93 were categorized as metabolic genes using the Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups classification. Within this metabolic category, amino acids, carbohydrates, inorganic ions, and secondary metabolite metabolism, as well as energy production and conversion, but not lipid metabolism, were enriched. Furthermore, genes involved in central metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, were highly induced in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34 under oily conditions, whereas they were suppressed in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521.

It should be noted that a closely related fungus, <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> UM521, produces lower amounts of MELs from vegetable oils than yeast strain of the genus <italic>Pseudozyma</italic>, including the strain T-34. While <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> DSM4500 was reported to produce extracellular glycolipids in the yield of 30 g/L from 45 g/L of sunflower oil as main carbon source, the glycolipids are the mixture of MELs and cellobiose lipids (CLs) [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Using gene set enrichment analysis, the gene sets related to fatty acid metabolism were significantly upregulated in the presence of vegetable oil, and the gene cluster for MEL biosynthesis was also highly expressed in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34, regardless of whether the carbon source was glucose or soybean oil (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227295.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>).

Surprisingly, the genes responsible for central metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the glyoxylate shunt, and the anaplerotic reaction were highly expressed in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34, regardless of whether the carbon source was glucose or soybean oil, whereas these genes were not induced in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521, which could be the reason for poor growth and lower MEL production under oily conditions. The characteristics of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34 that enabled it to efficiently metabolize vegetable oil via the central metabolic pathway facilitated the production of large amounts of extracellular MELs. In the future, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> will be increasingly used as a platform for new biomaterial production processes, such as producing functional lipids from oily biomass.</p><p>Previously, we reported that the genome sequence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34 was closely related to that of <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521, based on the results of synteny analysis [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, gene set enrichment analysis of the transcriptome revealed that gene expression differed markedly between <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34 and <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521 in the presence of glucose. The present analysis focused on the expression of genes required for cell growth under oily conditions, which prompted us to further investigate the prerequisites for extracellular production of MELs utilizing large quantities of vegetable oil.</p><p>In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34, fatty acids derived from vegetable oil by enzymatic degradation were processed via chain-shortening pathways such as beta-oxidation, and the intermediates were directly transferred into mannosylerythritol, resulting in production of MELs [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521 did not metabolize vegetable oil, resulting in poor growth and low MEL productivity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227295.g005">Fig 5</xref></bold>) identical to our previous report [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This phenomenon was supported by the present transcriptomic analysis, showing that the expression levels of most genes of central metabolic pathways were reduced under oily conditions in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521.</p><p>However, the genes encoding enzymes in the TCA cycle (citrate synthase, aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and malate dehydrogenase), glyoxylate shunt (isocitrate lyase and malate synthase), and anaplerotic reaction (malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) were highly expressed in the presence of vegetable oil in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227295.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>). A similar process has been reported in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> when cultured with acetate or fatty acid as a sole carbon source [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227295.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis revealed that the glyoxylate shunt was activated in <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> for growth and lipids production when cultured with acetic acid, which is kind of volatile fatty acid, as sole carbon source [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Importantly, the glyoxylate shunt and anaplerotic reaction contribute to carbon assimilation from acetyl-CoA and effective carbon delivery into the gluconeogenesis pathway, respectively. Additionally, enhancement of these primary metabolic activities may lead to improved sugar synthesis for cell growth and MEL production from vegetable oil. Therefore, although the direction of the carbon flow was unclear in the results of transcriptomic analysis, most reactions in the glycolytic process are reversible, and it is probable that the enhanced expression of glycolysis genes reflected the activation of gluconeogenesis under oily conditions. Further metabolomics studies are needed to reveal the carbon flow in the primary metabolic pathways under oily conditions. Although <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34 and <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521 are closely related species, characteristics of growth and MEL production, including the activities of central metabolic pathways, differ between them. We hypothesize that these differences originated in specific growth environments and lifestyles. The genus <italic>Pseudozyma</italic> is often isolated from plant surfaces in nature [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227295.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227295.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and utilizes cuticles composed of water insoluble fatty acid esters covering leaves with their lipases and esterases [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Genus <italic>Pseudozyma</italic> may therefore utilize the secretion of biosurfactants such as MELs to uptake emulsified cuticles as a carbon source. However, <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521 is a maize pathogen, and can utilize starch-derived sugar, which is abundant in the growing environment. Our transcriptomic analysis suggested that sufficient primary metabolic activity was required for growth and MEL production under oily conditions, in addition to expression of the genes responsible for MEL biosynthesis and oil degradation in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic>. These results indicate that <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic>, unlike <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic>, adapted to utilize sugars as the main carbon source.</p><p>Moreover, 111 of the 264 genes in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227295.s001">S1 Table</xref></bold> had no clear assignment, and were listed as &#x0201c;function unknown,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;general function predicted only&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;no description.&#x0201d; We further categorized these genes based on the Pfam database.

Further studies related to these genes will help identify fundamental differences in the metabolic systems between nonpathogenic <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> T-34 and plant-pathogenic <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> UM521.</p><p>Various vegetable oils have been used as main carbon sources for MEL production, due to high productivities, e.g., <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aphidis</italic> produced 165 g/L of MELs (the main product is MEL-A) from soybean oil and glucose, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>regulosa</italic> produced 142 g/L of MELs (the main product is MEL-A) from soybean oil and erythritol, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tsukubaensis</italic> produced 73.1 g/L of MELs (the main product is MEL-B) from soybean oil. While <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> also produced MELs from sunflower oil, the productivity was lower than that of the genus <italic>Pseudozyma</italic> due to the products were a mixture of MELs and CLs. On the other hand, soluble carbon sources such as glycerol, glucose, and sucrose were examined for MEL production, e.g., <italic>P</italic>. <italic>antarctica</italic> produced mono-acylated type of MEL as the main product from glucose [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> produced 32.1 g/L of a glycolipid mixture of MELs and CLs from glycerol [<xref rid="pone.0227295.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

After careful consideration by four experts in the field, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the various rather minor points raised during the review process.</p><p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by the end of september. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p><p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p><p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. This file should be uploaded as separate file and labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Marie-Joelle Virolle, PhD</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Journal Requirements:</p><p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p><p>1.

In contrast, most of these genes are down-regulated in U. maydis.</p><p>Finally, the authors demonstrate that under soybean oil conditions isocitrate dehydrogenase expression is increased and this coincides with increased activity.</p><p>The current work is interesting and will allow further manipulation of P. antarctica T-34 to increase MEL biosynthesis.</p><p>But there are some points necessary to improve the manuscript, the tables and the figures:</p><p>The title starts with &#x0201c;A novel aspect..&#x0201d; Please specify or change the title.</p><p>Lane 20: industrial lipases, mannosyl&#x02026;</p><p>Lane 85: please complete the sentence: &#x0201c;&#x02026;adapted to aerobically&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Lane 110: please specify the concentration of the NH4OH-solution used as solvent system</p><p>Lane 150: The title &#x0201c;Pseudozyma antarctica genes are expressed&#x02026;&#x0201d; is confusing. What kind of genes do you mean? Not all genes are expressed with high intensity, are they?</p><p>Table 1: I guess that you have ordered the table according to the Alphabet of the description. I would prefer to have then the description in the first column (not in the second). For the metabolism section &#x0201c;Energy production&#x02026;&#x0201d; should be reordered. The row &#x0201c;Total CDS&#x0201d; should be changed with the row &#x0201c;The genes categorized&#x02026;&#x0201d;. You have mentioned in the entire table only the KOG classified genes (93+42+16+28=179)</p><p>Lane 241: remove &#x0201c;Consequently,&#x0201d;</p><p>Lane 258 spelling: Antarctica</p><p>Lane 297: &#x0201c;large amounts of MELs&#x0201d;: can you specify, which variants of MELs are produced?</p><p>Lane 311: &#x02026;isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+)&#x02026;&#x0201d; In the figure you use MaxV. Please clearify.</p><p>Lane 317: &#x0201c;&#x02026;no activity was noted under oily conditions.</p><p>Figure 1: According to the legend (Lanes 54-56) the proteins are assigned differently (Emt1p not EMT1 and so on). The proteins involved in the step from mono-acylation to di-acylation are the acyl-transferases MAC1 and MAC2 (Mac1p/Mac2p). In your scheme acylation of C3 (by Mac2p) precedes the acylation of C2 (by Mac1p).

Please use for all domain abbreviations the full form.</p><p>Reviewer #3: The manuscript "A novel aspect of the production of mannosylerythritol lipids in Pseudozyma antarctica</p><p>T-34 based on gene expression of central metabolic pathways" gives new insights on the genetic and metabolic regulations controlling mannosylerythritol lipids (MEL) biosynthesis in two yeasts.</p><p>The manuscript is providing a new piece o knowledge ans is sound for publications, yet after considering the following comments:</p><p>1- Lines 344-345: The authors mention that the Ustilago maydis had poor growth when using vegetable oils as carbon source, which is not the case with Pseudozyma antarctica. I strongly suggest the absence of lipases and esterases in U. maydis which explain their poor growth and low MEL production. Therefore, I suggest the authors screen the genome of U. maydis for lipases and esterases and if absent, to use this as the explanation of the poor growth and low MEL production. Also, does U. maydis grow on alkanes or fatty acids or glycerol separately?</p><p>2- Line 67-68: Although authors are referring to reference 15, yet it would be easier for the reader to know briefly how the genomic and transcriptomic analyses led to the conclusion that P. antarctica is oleaginous.</p><p>3- Lines 198-199: hard to read. it is better to say "metabolism related genes" rather than "metabolism genes"</p><p>4- Line 253: glyocylate to glyoxylate.</p><p>5- it is strongly recommended to show the expression fold changes of MEL biosynthetic genes and transport in a single separate figure similar to figure 3.</p><p>6- English style and grammer needs some improvement for a more easy reading.</p><p>Reviewer #4: The results embody this manuscript is a continuation of their previous studies, and has merit.

There are so many biasses on this technique (substrate, lipid extraction by MeOH, evaporation, cell size, lipid content,....).</p><p>So I suggest, either you analyse your production parameters (in g/(L*h)). If this is no option than you will have to remove your claims of higher production or state that a TLC analysis based on visual comparison can only give a small hint for higher concentration.</p><p>Biomass should be measured with another technique than cell wet weight like e.g. cell dry weight after removal of product by ethyl acetate washing. (don't use MeOH, ethyl acetate will evaporate).</p><p>If there is a difference in biomass than should the productivity be linked to the biomass as well (specific productivity). This will probably result in interesting findings.</p><p>2)</p><p>Figure 2 B&#x00026;C: As described in your article, &#x0201c;Genome and transcriptome analysis of the asidiomycetous yeast Pseudozyma Antarctica producing extracellular glycolipids, mannosylerythritol lipids&#x0201d;, there were gene transcriptions who were significantly different (p-value &#x0003c;0.005).
