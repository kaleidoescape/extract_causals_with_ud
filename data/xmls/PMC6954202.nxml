In this study, we investigated the reliability and applicability of label-free impedance flow cytometry (IFC) for <italic>in vitro</italic> nanotoxicity screening, which avoids time-consuming labelling steps and minimizes possible NM-induced interferences. U937 human lymphoma cells were exposed for 24&#x02009;h to eight different nanomaterials at five concentrations (2, 10, 20, 50, and 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL). The NMs&#x02019; effect on viability was measured using IFC and the results were compared to those obtained by trypan blue (TB) dye exclusion and conventional flow cytometry (FC). To discriminate viable from necrotic cells, the IFC measurement settings regarding signal trigger level and frequency, as well as the buffer composition, were optimised. A clear discrimination between viable and necrotic cells was obtained at 6&#x02009;MHz in a sucrose-based measurement buffer. Nanomaterial-induced interferences were not detected for IFC. The IFC and TB assay results were in accordance for all NMs. The IFC was found to be robust, reliable and less prone to interferences due to the advantage of being label-free.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Medical research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100011263</institution-id><institution>EC | EC Seventh Framework Programm | FP7 Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies (FP7-NMP - Specific Programme &#x00026;quot;Cooperation&#x00026;amp;quot;: Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and New Production Technologies)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310584</award-id><award-id>310584</award-id><award-id>310584</award-id><award-id>310584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ostermann</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><name><surname>Birkeland</surname><given-names>Eivind</given-names></name><name><surname>Cimpan</surname><given-names>Mihaela Roxana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x00026;amp;amp;#x00E5;d (Research Council of Norway)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>239199</award-id><award-id>246672</award-id><award-id>239199</award-id><award-id>246672</award-id><award-id>271075</award-id><award-id>246672</award-id><award-id>239199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ostermann</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Sauter</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Cimpan</surname><given-names>Mihaela Roxana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x00026;amp;amp;#x00E5;d (Research Council of Norway)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x00026;amp;amp;#x00E5;d (Research Council of Norway)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x00026;amp;amp;#x00E5;d (Research Council of Norway)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>EC | EC Seventh Framework Programm | FP7 Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies (FP7-NMP - Specific Programme &#x00026;quot;Cooperation&#x00026;amp;quot;: Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and New Production Technologies)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>EC | EC Seventh Framework Programm | FP7 Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies (FP7-NMP - Specific Programme &#x00026;quot;Cooperation&#x00026;amp;quot;: Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and New Production Technologies)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x00026;amp;amp;#x00E5;d (Research Council of Norway)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x00026;amp;amp;#x00E5;d (Research Council of Norway)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>EC | EC Seventh Framework Programm | FP7 Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new Production Technologies (FP7-NMP - Specific Programme &#x00026;quot;Cooperation&#x00026;amp;quot;: Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and New Production Technologies)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x00026;amp;amp;#x00E5;d (Research Council of Norway)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>UH-nett Vest Department of Clinical Dentistry, University of Bergen</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9;

The widespread production and use has led to an increased exposure to NMs and raises concerns with regard to their potential adverse effects on human health and the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. To address these issues a new branch of toxicology, named nanotoxicology, has emerged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. A major challenge in nanotoxicity testing is the heterogeneity of NMs and the lack of standardized techniques for assessing their physicochemical properties and biological effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Many colorimetric <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, while well-established for chemicals and pharmaceuticals, have been shown to generate false-positive or false-negative results due to NM-caused interferences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Kroll <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) found that these interferences are particle, concentration, and assay specific, and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays have thus to be individually adapted and optimized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which makes testing of NMs difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Therefore, first-line interference-free screening methods are urgently needed in order to detect NM formulations that are toxic early in the development, as well as to identify the concentrations and time points at which modifications occur in order to provide clues for further investigations. Based on these primary screenings, more resource-heavy mechanistic studies can be performed, thus sparing overall labour and financial resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Conventional flow cytometry (FC) is a widely used technique, having the advantage of rapidly assessing high numbers of individual cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, labelling of the cells is needed and interactions of the NMs with assay reagents and fluorescence have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, impedance flow cytometry (IFC) uses label-free impedance-based readings for rapid and multiparametric analysis of single cells, making it a promising future candidate to assess cellular nanotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The value measured in IFC is the electric impedance (<italic>Z</italic>) of biological cells, which is a complex number consisting of two parts: the resistance (<italic>R</italic>, the real part of <italic>Z</italic>) and the reactance (<italic>X</italic>, the imaginary part of <italic>Z</italic>), which is frequency dependent.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The cell membrane itself acts as an insulator at low frequencies, allowing the determination of cell size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. At such frequencies, the cell membrane is polarized and hinders the flow of the electrical current (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The charge distribution of the charged molecules on the inside of the cell changes when an oscillating electric field is applied to the cell. When medium frequencies are used, the membrane polarization decreases and the cell membrane integrity can be assessed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Currents of relatively high frequency, effectively pass the membrane and thus the intracellular properties can be measured (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Behaviour of a cell in an electric field.

Coulter in the 1950s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, that relied on direct current or low frequency measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Its major use was to count and determine the size of cells. In 1987 the CASY technology, also relying on electric field-based cell analysis, was introduced (Sch&#x000e4;rfe System GmbH), which besides cell concentrations also assessed cell viability based on the plasma membrane integrity. Both techniques use electrolyte-containing measurement reservoirs and impedance changes result from the volume displacement of cells/particles when passing through the apertures. Later, a microfluidic chip for cell and particle size characterization (100 samples/s) was proposed by Gawad <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2001)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which combined spectral impedance, flow cytometry and the Coulter particle counter principle. This was further developed by Amphasys AG (Switzerland) and is now commercially available as a portable IFC, which employs a microfluidic chip containing two pairs of microelectrodes on each side of a microchannel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). One of these pairs is used for sensing changes in the electric current at a given voltage, effectively measuring the change in impedance caused by a cell passing by, whereas the other pair acts as reference. An example of the measured impedance signal is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Eq. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). It consists of an imaginary (Y, green) and real (X, blue) part. The trigger level (red) is used to set the threshold for the measurements and determines which signal is accepted as particle/cell (signal above triggering level) and what is considered noise or cell debris (signal smaller than triggering level). The measurement output is presented in form of a density scatter plot as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, with a specific amplitude and phase revealing different cell populations.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Microfluidic chip used in the IFC.

Either in the form of resistance and reactance or in the polar form of amplitude and phase as shown in Eq.

The information can then be related to biological key parameters like cell viability and membrane permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and subsequently be used as a measure of toxicity of the tested material.</p><p id="Par7">To our knowledge, IFC differs from existing commercial instruments in that it measures the electrical properties of single cells in high throughput using a wide range of frequencies. One cell can be investigated simultaneously by several frequencies, allowing valuable insight into the state of the cells based on their size, membrane, and intracellular properties.

The calculated R<sup>2</sup>-values for TB and IFC for the four most cytotoxic materials were close to one, which represents a good fit. This can be explained by the fact that both viability assays revealed, in the form they were used, the permeability status of the cell membrane. Necrotic cells are associated with a disrupted membrane, making the interior of the cell accessible for both the entry of dyes, like in the TB assay, and to ion exchange, as indirectly measured by IFC. In comparison to the TB assay, additional information about intracellular density and cell size can be gained with the IFC, when measured at higher and lower frequencies, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, we focused only on intermediate frequencies (6&#x02009;MHz) in our analysis, which made a straightforward method-comparison possible. Minor differences in cell viability between TB and IFC can be due to a differing sensitivity of the methods. The TB assay is an image-based labelling assay that detects later stages of cell death with cells being either stained blue (non-viable) or not stained (viable), whereas the IFC can detect earlier phases of cell death (apoptosis), which may result in slightly different viability values.</p><p id="Par25">While TB and IFC results were in accordance, discrepancies were found between IFC and FC in terms of reliability.

Moreover, as evident from our results, this method may also have potential for testing of, <italic>e.g</italic>., chemotherapeutics and novel drug delivery tools. Similar to FC, robust results are obtained due to a high number of analysed cells (10,000 cells/sample, TB assay only 200&#x02013;300 cells), including the possibility to find smaller subpopulations and different stages of cellular damage. The IFC measures each cell individually at up to four frequencies, with two parameters measured for each frequency. This multiparametric analysis can supply data about the membrane capacitance, cytoplasmic conductivity, cell density, and allows the differentiation between viable and necrotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, microfluidic chips with various channel sizes can be adapted to the size of the analysed cells in order to adjust sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. An auto sampler for up to 192 samples and barcode scanners are already commercially available and can be used to further automate the process and to increase the reproducibility and the throughput. Thus, the IFC shows potential as a fist-line high-throughput screening tool. However, the benefits come with an increased complexity of the system. Similar to FC, experience and training to ensure correct usage and interpretation are necessary to obtain reliable data. Moreover, the measurement buffer, trigger level and frequencies need to be fine-tuned in order to improve the signal of interest, in our case to ensure a good differentiation between necrotic and viable cells. Another crucial step is the sample preparation, where washing steps are highly recommended to minimize the amount of residual medium, which ensures a correct and reproducible buffer composition. However, this extra washing step can be a source of shortcomings, such as a loss of dead and smaller-sized cells during centrifugation. We used therefore longer centrifugation times, as usually needed in normal cell culture procedures to prevent this loss. Appropriate positive and negative controls are necessary to ensure accuracy, reliability, and precision, as well as reproducibility. Regularly rinsing and flushing of the system and chip, <italic>e.g</italic>., after each sample, are necessary to avoid chip and tube blockages and, more importantly, to avoid carryover of debris and leftover cells from previous samples, especially after highly toxic NMs. These cleaning procedures increase the measurement times and of the procedures in general.</p><p id="Par28">As shown in this study, IFC has proven its merit for <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment of NM-induced toxicity.

The supernatant was carefully discarded, the cell pellets were resuspended in 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;L PBS, and stored on ice until measured. Before each measurement, 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of a 0.28&#x02009;M aqueous sucrose solution (final buffer ratio 1:4 PBS: sucrose solution) was added to allow physiological osmolality, while keeping a low buffer conductivity compared to the normal intracellular conductivity of healthy cells. This provided a good contrast between healthy and dead cells as judged based on the loss of membrane integrity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). To ensure that cells maintained their viability in this buffer for the whole duration of the testing, the viability of the control (unexposed) cells was also measured at the end of the testing session. Cells heated at 70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;min served as positive control for necrosis. To test for possible NM interferences, the highest NM concentration (100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL) was added to cell-free medium, negative and positive cell controls. Impedance-based measurements (Ampha Z30, Amphasys AG, Switzerland) were carried out using 0.5, 2, 6, and 12&#x02009;MHz and a microfluidic chip with a channel of a 50 &#x003bc;m x 50 &#x003bc;m-sized cross section.
