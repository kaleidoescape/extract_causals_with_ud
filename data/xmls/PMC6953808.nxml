As alternatives to the antibiotic fumagillin, ten nutraceuticals (oregano oil, thymol, carvacrol, <italic>trans</italic>-cinnmaldehyde, tetrahydrocurcumin, sulforaphane, naringenin, embelin, allyl sulfide, hydroxytyrosol) and two immuno-stimulatory compounds (chitosan, poly I:C) were examined for controlling <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infections. Caged bees were inoculated with <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> spores, and treatments were administered in sugar syrup. Only two compounds did not significantly reduce <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> spore counts compared to the infected positive control, but the most effective were sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables, carvacrol from oregano oil, and naringenin from citrus fruit. When tested at several concentrations, the highest sulforaphane concentration reduced spore counts by 100%, but also caused 100% bee mortality. For carvacrol, the maximum reduction in spore counts was 57% with an intermediate concentration and the maximum bee mortality was 23% with the highest concentration. For naringenin, the maximum reduction in spore counts was 64% with the highest concentration, and the maximum bee mortality was only 15% with an intermediate concentration. In the longevity experiment, naringenin-fed bees lived as long as <italic>Nosema</italic>-free control bees, both of which lived significantly longer than infected positive control bees. While its antimicrobial properties may be promising, reducing sulforaphane toxicity to bees is necessary before it can be considered as a candidate for controlling <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>. Although further work on formulation is needed with naringenin, its effect on extending longevity in infected bees may give it an additional value as a potential additive for bee feed in honey bee colonies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs</institution></funding-source><award-id>200456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5632-0642</contrib-id><name><surname>Guzman-Novoa</surname><given-names>Ernesto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by a grant from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs to EG (Grant No. 200456).

The honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, is infected by two species of microsporidia, <italic>Nosema apis</italic> and <italic>Nosema ceranae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> infect the midgut epithelium of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mellifera</italic>, resulting in impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients and affecting metabolic processes. These microsporidia down-regulate genes related to intestinal health, nutrient absorption and antioxidant activity [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, in places where both parasites exist, such as in Canada, USA and Europe, infections by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> have become more common than infections by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> causes suppression of the immune response in honey bees by downregulating the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], although another study showed that <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> can also up-regulate AMP genes of honey bees [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infections cause increased energetic stress on the bee, leading to degeneration of epithelial cells and significantly shortening its life span [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Infection with <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> has been associated with the loss of honey bee colonies in Europe and North America [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The only registered treatment for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> infection for over 60 years has been the antibiotic bicyclohexylammonium fumagillin (fumagillin), isolated from the fungus <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although it degrades quickly in the hive, fumagillin residues can persist in honey and wax for up to six months [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These low concentrations of fumagillin can lead to the development of resistance, causing hyper-proliferation of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>, but not <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The development of fumagillin resistance in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> and the risk of contaminating honey with toxic residues point to a need for safer, alternative treatments for nosema disease.</p><p>An alternative approach to control intestinal diseases is the use of nutraceuticals, which are foods (or parts of foods) having health benefits, including the prevention and/or treatment of diseases through their antimicrobial, antioxidant, immuno-stimulatory and/or anti-inflammatory activities [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Examples of nutraceuticals with both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities are (di)allyl sulfide, from garlic, that lowered infection prevalence of <italic>Nosema bombycis</italic> when given orally to the silkworm, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and attenuated intestinal damage when fed to rats [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and trans-cinnamaldehyde, from <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> spp. (cinnamon), which when fed to chickens, reduced intestinal populations of pathogenic bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and down-regulated genes that induce inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Others have both antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, such as sulforaphane, from cruciferous vegetables, which increased expression of antioxidant genes when fed to mice [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and suppressed growth of numerous bacteria and fungi <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Nutraceuticals with both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities include naringenin, a flavone from citrus fruit, that decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and reduced oxidative damage when fed to mice [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and rats [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the phenolic compound, hydroxytyrosol, from olive oil, that directly scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mice [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], while also down-regulating genes associated with inflammation in rats [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The hydroxyl benzoquinone, embelin, from <italic>Embelia ribes</italic> (false black pepper), also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice intestines [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and increasing the expression of antioxidant genes when fed to rats [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Some nutraceuticals have immuno-stimulatory activity, such as the synthetic, double-stranded viral RNA molecule, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), which induced an immune response in chickens [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and also induced a moderate immune response in the Pacific white shrimp, <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>, similar to a challenge with the pathogen, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and the acetylated chitin polysaccharide, chitosan, from the shells of crustaceans, that caused an increase in serum levels of a number of immunoglobulins when fed to chickens [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and also increased expression of a number of AMPs when fed to honey bees [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Thus far, there have been relatively few attempts to use nutraceuticals to control <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> in honey bees. Feeding bees thyme and winter savory extracts containing the antimicrobial compounds, thymol and carvacrol (both of which are also found in oregano oil), in sugar syrup, did not reduce <italic>Nosema</italic> spp. spore loads in the field, although they did decrease bee mortality [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, many other studies that fed bees thymol or the anti-inflammatory compound, resveratrol, found that both reduced <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> spore loads in infected bees, and resveratrol also decreased bee mortality [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similarly, feeding bees curcumin, an antimicrobial compound from turmeric (<italic>Curcuma longa</italic>), reduced <italic>Nosema</italic> spp. spore loads and increased survival of infected bees [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While they were not tested in this study, promising results have also been seen with algal polysaccharides [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], oxalic acid [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and porphyrins [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], all of which reduced <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> spore loads when fed to bees in sugar syrup.</p><p>The limited studies thus far indicate that nutraceuticals may be effective in controlling <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infection due either to antimicrobial properties against the parasite, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties to reduce symptoms of infection, or immuno-stimulant properties that may help the bee to fight the parasite. They may also increase longevity in infected bees. This study was conducted to screen a diverse collection of nutraceuticals and immuno-stimulants using caged bees to examine their potential in reducing <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> spore counts and increasing the life span of inoculated honey bees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title><italic>Nosema ceranae</italic> spore extraction</title><p>Honey bee foragers were collected from hives at the University of Guelph&#x02019;s Honey Bee Research Centre in Ontario, Canada, using a modified vacuum [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

Ethanol at a concentration of 4 &#x003bc;l/ml of sugar syrup was added to feeders containing oregano oil, thymol, carvacrol, fumagillin, tetrahydrocurcumin, sulforaphane, naringenin, embelin, and allyl sulfide to aid in dissolving the compounds. The feeders containing chitosan, trans-cinnamaldehyde, poly I:C, and hydroxytyrosol had the same volume of distilled water added instead of ethanol to aid in dissolving the compounds. No phase separation was observed with any of the compounds. Non-inoculated, negative control and inoculated, positive control bees, were both given drip feeders containing only 50% sugar syrup. The standard treatment control consisted of inoculated bees fed sugar syrup containing 0.05 mg/ml fumagillin. Feeders containing water were also provided for all cages. Feeders were changed every four days and weighed before and after changing using a balance (Model S-403, Denver Instrument, Bohemia, New York, USA) to determine syrup consumption. The average number of bees alive between each feeder change and the amount of syrup consumed was used to estimate total feed intake per bee over 16 days. Dead bees were removed daily and counted. At 16 days post-inoculation (dpi), remaining bees were sacrificed and stored at -20&#x000b0;C. Spore counts were done as per Cantwell [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] using the midguts of the remaining bees as one pooled sample per cage. Bee mortality was calculated as percent mortality over a period of 16 dpi excluding bees that died within 2 dpi, as this is typically due to handling and inoculation stress and not <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infection; it never exceeded three bees in all cases.

Mortality was measured as previously described, but bees were not sacrificed at any point for spore counts. Instead, spore counts were performed at 10 and 15 dpi on samples of individual bees that had died on those days (3&#x02013;10 bees), to ensure normal pathogen development. Cumulative survival was derived from the mortality data and the experiment was repeated three times. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created for each treatment using the cumulative survival data for individual bees within a particular treatment cage [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As with previous experiments, bees that died within 2 dpi were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An analysis of variance with the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure at p = 0.05 was used to determine differences among the treatments. When significant treatment effects were found, means were separated by Least Significant Difference tests (LSD, p = 0.05). Best fit regression models were used to examine the relationship between spore counts, mortality and feed intake to different concentrations of selected treatments. As responses to concentrations were pooled from the primary screening and dose response experiments, the positive control values were pooled for the analyses. Because of the low number of bees alive for much of the experiment with 0.625 mg/ml sulforaphane, the feed and water intake appeared to be over-estimated due to normal dripping of the sugar syrup and water feeders, and thus the feed intake and water intake values for that concentration were excluded from all analyses. The honey bee longevity experiment was analysed by creating Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the bees in each treatment. The curves were compared using a log-rank/Mantel-Cox post hoc test to determine which curves were significantly different from one another. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, New York), and all tests used a Type I error rate of 0.05 to determine significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Primary screening</title><p>No <italic>Nosema</italic> spores were detected in the negative control and fumagillin treatments, while the highest spore counts were for the positive control (<xref rid="pone.0227484.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

Among the compounds tested, only thymol had been previously reported to reduce <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> spore loads and reduce mortality in infected bees [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Of the twelve compounds tested, only hydroxytyrosol and trans-cinnamaldehyde did not show a significant effect on spore counts, indicating that many nutraceutical and immuno-stimulatory compounds may be able to control <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> to varying extents.</p><p>Sulforaphane was considered to be sufficiently promising in the primary screening, and so it was also tested at several concentrations. It could reduce spore counts at all except the lowest concentration (0.0125 mg/ml) and was able to completely eliminate spores from the samples at the highest concentration tested (1.2500 mg/ml), indicating high effectiveness. Even at intermediate concentrations (0.1250 mg/ml and 0.1667 mg/ml), sulforaphane was able to reduce spore counts by 71% and 64%, respectively, compared to the positive control. One reason for this is that sulforaphane can arrest the growth of a wide range of bacteria and fungi by reducing cell proliferation and repair, and inducing apoptosis in microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Johansson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] noted that sulforaphane&#x02019;s antimicrobial effect is likely not selective to pathogens but could also arrest growth of beneficial microbes in the gut, which would be harmful to the bee. The loss of beneficial microbes in the bee gut could have contributed to the increased mortality in the bees. Sulforaphane could also harm the bee by inducing apoptosis in host cells [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infection alters expression of host genes related to apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], with apoptosis being almost completely absent in the midgut of infected bees, likely as a means of suppressing defense responses [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Induction of apoptosis in the midgut by sulforaphane might cause damage to intestinal function, contributing to the increase in mortality and decrease in feed intake that was observed.</p><p>Another reason why sulforaphane could have reduced the parasite&#x02019;s infection is that it is a potent inducer of antioxidant genes [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Infection with <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and decreases expression and activity of antioxidants [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This increases oxidative stress and damages epithelial cells, which in combination with preventing cell repair, is believed to aid the parasite in spreading and infecting new cells [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Sulforaphane&#x02019;s induction of antioxidant gene expression may have prevented this, thus depriving the parasite of this potential advantage during infection. However, too high of expression of antioxidants can be damaging to animals and prevent cell repair [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], which may have contributed to increased bee mortality and decreased feed intake.</p><p>A further reason why sulforaphane may have been toxic to the bees is that it down-regulates a number of kinases involved in the Wnt signalling pathway, thus reducing cell proliferation and repair, which helps provide sulforaphane with its anticancer properties [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Dussaubat et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed that <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infection also down-regulates many genes in the Wnt pathway, leading to decreased repair of damaged tissue in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>-infected honey bees. If infected bees treated with sulforaphane experienced down-regulation of the Wnt pathway from both <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infection and sulforaphane treatment, then cell repair may have been so reduced that the midgut epithelium may have been functioning inadequately, thus resulting in increased mortality and decreased feed intake. This would be exacerbated by the damage caused by sulforaphane&#x02019;s induction of apoptosis in host cells [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Naringenin was also considered to be sufficiently promising in the primary screening that it was further tested at several concentrations, which were all effective at reducing spore counts, although not to the extent observed with sulforaphane. Naringenin is a potent anti-inflammatory compound, with its many hydroxyl groups allowing it to act directly as an antioxidant [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In mice and rats, oral administration of naringenin drastically reduced intestinal and liver inflammation, respectively, by down-regulating expression of free radical-generating enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus lowering ROS levels and preventing oxidative damage [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This could have helped control the parasite by blocking its method of spreading from one cell to another, as described previously for sulforaphane. However, little is known about cytokines or inflammation in honey bees, and therefore, anti-inflamatory activity is solely based on literature with mammals.</p><p>While naringenin did not result in a significant decrease in mortality in the primary screening or when tested at different concentrations, it did decrease mortality in infected bees when analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Infected, naringenin-fed bees lived as long as the uninfected control bees. A reason for this result may be that the Kaplan-Meier survival curves involve measuring mortality up until the last bee has died, unlike the mortality test in the primary screening and dose response experiments, where mortality measurements were terminated at 16 dpi. Thus, long term decreases in bee mortality with naringenin would not have been observed as the last bees dying with naringenin treatment occurred at 37 dpi.</p><p>While naringenin&#x02019;s effect on reducing spore loads was only moderate, its effect on extending longevity in infected bees could make it a potential control for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infections. Naringenin may not be able to eliminate spores and prevent their spread completely, but it may be able to significantly reduce or even eliminate symptoms of infection, such as the energetic stress and reduction in lifespan seen in infected bees [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Naringenin&#x02019;s anti-inflammatory properties may explain why naringenin-fed bees were found to live significantly longer than infected, positive control bees. The increase in ROS generation and decrease in antioxidant activity caused by <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infection may be responsible for reducing the life span of infected bees [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of naringenin and its ability to down-regulate free radical-generating enzymes may have reduced these negative impacts, allowing for longer life spans.</p><p>Another reason why naringenin could have increased bee longevity is that it may positively affect the fat body of the bee. Assini et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that feeding naringenin increased lipid metabolism in mice fed a high fat diet. If increased lipid metabolism occurred in honey bees, then it could have increased the activity of their fat body, which is the main site of lipid metabolism in insects. The fat body is related to longevity through its links to nutritional and metabolic pathways [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and is also the main immunogenic organ, where expression of many immune-related genes is highest [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Increasing fat body development, such as by feeding bees pollen sources rich in lipids, increases expression of many immune genes, which could be beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, further work is needed to determine if feeding bees naringenin affects fat body development.</p><p>Both naringenin and sulforaphane exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], but in this study, these compounds caused significantly different levels of bee mortality. This is likely due to naringenin being mainly an antioxidant and free-radical scavenger [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while sulforaphane also has strong antimicrobial properties in addition to its effect on antioxidant gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It is likely that sulforaphane&#x02019;s inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and repair, and its induction of apoptosis were the dominant effects it had in this study, leading to a strong reduction in spore counts, but an associated increase in bee mortality.</p><p>Carvacrol was considered to be sufficiently promising in the primary screening that it was further tested at several concentrations. Like in the cases of naringenin and sulforaphane, several concentrations were effective at reducing spore counts. However, spore counts were relatively unchanged with increasing concentrations, unlike naringenin and sulforaphane, with an intermediate concentration (0.1000 mg/ml) resulting in the lowest spore counts.</p><p>Carvacrol had never been directly tested in honey bees for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> control, but thymol, as well as different essential oils containing carvacrol, have been tested against <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>. Thymol significantly reduced spore counts in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic>-infected bees in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, Maistrello et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Costa et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] did not see any significant effects until 25 dpi, while van den Heever et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] saw a 40% reduction in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> spores after 17 days. Thymol and carvacrol showed a reduction in spore counts by 16 dpi in this study. Bogdan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found that the essential oil of thyme and winter savory (both containing carvacrol and thymol) did not reduce spore counts of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> in honey bees in either the field or in the lab, but they did lower bee mortality associated with <italic>N</italic>. <italic>apis</italic> infection. However, the current study may be the first direct evidence that carvacrol is also effective in reducing <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> spore counts.</p><p>Oregano oil was likely effective in reducing the number of spores/bee in this study because it contains carvacrol and thymol, both having activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, it may be less desirable as a treatment compared to purified thymol or carvacrol as the amount of active ingredients cannot be controlled in a plant extract. For example, carvacrol levels in oregano oil can vary between 50 and 70% [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Like carvacrol and thymol, oregano oil did not affect bee mortality in the primary screening, although oregano oil has been shown to have a slightly toxic effect on bees [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Tetrahydrocurcumin and embelin caused reductions in spore counts in this study. Tetrahydrocurcumin and embelin are potent anti-inflammatories when fed to mice and significantly reduce oxidative damage [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Tetrahydrocurcumin is a metabolite of curcumin, the main active ingredient in the spice turmeric (<italic>Curcuma longa</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and curcumin reduced <italic>Nosema</italic> spp. spore loads and increased survival and overall health of infected bees [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Embelin and tetrahydrocurcumin also have stimulatory effects on lipid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], similar to that of naringenin [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and carvacrol [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which could increase the immune response associated with the fat body of the bee as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Allyl sulfide in this study reduced spore counts, but did not affect mortality.

The authors pointed out that while allicin and its metabolites are antimicrobial, they are extremely unstable, especially in ethanolic extracts. However, isolated allyl sulfide did reduce spore counts in this study, perhaps because it is more antimicrobial or somewhat more stable than other ethanolic garlic extracts.</p><p>Poly I:C also reduced <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> spore counts in this study. It is a synthetic, double-stranded viral RNA molecule that acts as an immunostimulant in mammals and birds by binding to the immune Toll-like receptor TLR3 and initiating an immune response [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Chitosan is also a weak antimicrobial compound, though it is mainly effective against bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227484.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Thus, it is not clear if the reduced spore counts are more due to an increased immune response or an antimicrobial effect.</p><p>In this study, almost all the compounds tested showed some promise as alternative controls for <italic>N</italic>. <italic>ceranae</italic> infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mellifera</italic>. However, the level of control was always limited and not comparable to the effectiveness of fumagillin, as none of the compounds&#x02013;with the exception of sulforaphane&#x02013;were able to completely eliminate spores. Sulforaphane was particularly effective, but more research is needed on ways of reducing its high toxicity to bees. While naringenin significantly reduced spore counts, it was most notable and promising for its effect on increasing longevity of infected bees. More work is needed to determine if even higher concentrations may be more effective without affecting mortality. However, while lower concentrations of naringenin similarly increased the longevity of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, higher concentrations were lethal [<xref rid="pone.0227484.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thus there may actually be detrimental effects to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>mellifera</italic> with high concentrations of naringenin. If the mode of action of naringenin, carvacrol, embelin and tetrahydrocurcumin in honey bees is related to the fat body, then their effectiveness could be increased if the compounds were fed in combination with a lipid-rich diet, which may also increase fat body development and immune function. This research has identified several promising compounds, but work is needed to understand their mode of action to achieve economically viable effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Paul Kelly, Nancy Bradbury, Dave Stotesbury, and a number of other volunteers at the Honey Bee Research Centre helped with sampling and feeding bees, while Pegah Valizadeh, Mariana Reyes, and Mollah Md.
