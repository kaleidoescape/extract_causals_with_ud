It is estimated that 20&#x02013;30% of adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] will experience the symptoms of TMD. The aetiology of TMD remains unknown but is thought to include parafunctional activity, stress, previous trauma and internal derangement of the disc complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Closed lock is a specific type of TMD where there is derangement of the articular disc complex and refers to the displacement of the disc, most commonly anteromedially, without reduction and resultant limited mouth opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In a normal joint, on initial mouth opening, the condylar head rotates followed by translation along the articular eminence on further opening. The articular disc will translate with the condyle to remain interpositioned between the head and the eminence. In patients with closed lock, the translation of the condyle is limited by the failure of the meniscus to reduce, as a consequence of the disc being displaced, most commonly anteromedially, with the posterior band becoming trapped anterior to the condyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been postulated that the articular disc may be attached to the eminence via adhesions, preventing reduction and has been linked with osteoarthrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Closed lock can be described as being acute or chronic depending on the duration of locking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is frequently accompanied with characteristic symptoms including: significant jaw pain, limitations of jaw movement (namely reduced maximal opening) and functional impairment (eating) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, a number of patients with anteromedial meniscus displacement report no clinic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] indicating that other factors are influential to the aetiology and severity of closed lock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These factors include the depth of the glenoid fossa, the steepness of the eminence and the size of the condylar head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The treatment modalities for closed lock are well documented within the literature and include both medical and surgical management options. Medical management includes the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, steroid therapy, rehabilitation with orthotic devices, physical therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The minimally invasive surgical options including arthroscopy and arthrocentesis are considered as first-line surgical modalities, with open surgery including: condylar shave, plication procedures and eminectomy of the articular eminence as alternative, secondary surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The consensus of the current literature is that surgical treatment for TMJ disc displacement without reduction, including that of closed lock, should be deferred for a minimum of 6&#x000a0;months to allow sufficient time for comprehensive medical management and rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Closed lock that proves refractory to non-surgical interventions should then be considered for an interventional surgical approach. In this retrospective study, the rationale for eminectomy as a surgical treatment option for closed lock is the removal of the articular eminence, which thereby eliminates the anatomic structure against which the articular disc becomes trapped on mouth opening and thereby relieves some or all of the symptoms. It has been hypothesised that articular eminectomy may successfully treat patients suffering closed lock and was first described by Stassen and Currie in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The pilot study concluded that &#x02018;Eminectomy appears to be a safe and simple method of reducing a closed lock of the TMJ&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Eminectomy as a standard surgical procedure was carried out by a preauricular incision using the Al-Qayat Bramley approach to expose the articular eminence followed by adequate removal and recontouring of the articular eminence using a bone saw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This procedure helps to eliminate mechanical interference and facilitates a smooth functioning surface for the joint translation. Unlike some open TMJ surgical procedures, the procedure is intra-capsular and the disc is not surgically repositioned and there is no interference with the internal joint mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The surgical treatment has a potential risk of damage to the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve. The literature reports varying degrees of incidence, from 9 to 18% of patients reporting transient weakness of facial nerve post-operatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The success of the operation can be measured by the following criteria: reduction in pain, improvement in function (mouth opening) and reduction in clicking.</p><p id="Par11">This study aims to assess the effectiveness and role of eminectomy as an alternative surgical option for the management of chronic closed lock.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methodology</title><p id="Par12">Due to the retrospective nature of this study, it was granted an exemption in writing by the University of Leeds IRB.</p><p id="Par13">In this retrospective study, data were collected from three different &#x02018;Oral and Maxillofacial Departments&#x02019;: Sunderland Royal Infirmary (UK), Hull Royal Infirmary (UK) and St James&#x02019; hospital Dublin (Ireland), between the years of 1995 and 2011. All patients who had undergone eminectomy were identified using the operating theatre lists, and the subsequent patient records were requested and analysed.

Failed conservative medical treatment is usually followed by TMJ arthrocentesis. The procedure has been shown in the literature to be minimally invasive yet very effective, relieving symptoms in more than 80% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, in this retrospective study, eminectomy has been shown as a safe and effective method that can be considered as a second-line surgical treatment option.</p><p id="Par25">Recent studies by Sidebottom et al. 2013 show that open temporomandibular surgeries can benefit patients with previous failed arthroscopy to help manage their pain, restriction and locking, especially in Wilkes stage 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The paper also highlighted that patients with Wilkes stage 5 had a higher risk of deterioration and poorer outcome after open temporomandibular joint surgery, and this should be considered an important predictor and must be highlighted in their consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Articular eminectomy has long been used for the treatment of recurrent articular disc dislocation by allowing free movement of the condyles through removal of the obstruction. In 1984, Hall demonstrated the use of meniscoplasty combined with a rudimental eminectomy for the treatment of closed lock, experiencing some degree of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In 1994, Nitzan and Dolwick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] postulated on the basis of 194 operated cases that adhesions caused by increased synovial viscosity and/or a hydraulic vacuum effect on the disc causing it to press against the slope of eminence can be alleviated by eminectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Stassen et al. in a pilot study discussed that the procedure is safe and simple to use for treatment of a closed lock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Eminectomy results in removal of the barrier to articular disc activity and therefore decompresses the intra-capsular compartment and creates a larger anterior recess in the superior joint space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The term eminectomy has also been rephrased as eminoplasty and essentially involves the mechanical release by removal and recontouring of the bony obstruction of the eminence. It thereby facilitates improved mouth opening and subsequent resolution of clinical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is essential to point out that the procedure of surgical eminectomy/eminoplasty must ensure good bony clearance medially and smooth contouring of the articular fossa to allow the smooth translation of the joint. It is also essential to point out that some patients with an anteriorly displaced disc may have no symptoms despite MRI findings, and this can sometimes be explained occasionally by slow, natural resorption of anterior surface of condylar head or posterior aspect of the articular eminence to create the space to release the trapped disc-natural eminoplasty.</p><p id="Par27">The contraindications for eminectomy are widely discussed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There are a number of relative contraindications including chronic mandibular dislocations associated with a shallow articular eminence and radiographic evidence of a vascularised eminence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A single, absolute contraindication to eminectomy has been noted where, in the presence of pneumatisation of the articular eminence, there is an increased risk of intracranial spread of inflammation along with an increased risk of temporal bone fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The presence of pneumatisation can be identified through radiographic examination with both orthopantomogram (OPT) and computed tomography (CT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The visual analogue scale and Wilkes staging system are established and accepted forms of grading for internal derangement of the TMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The retrospective nature and geographical distribution of the study has led to these data being poorly recorded and its documentation would have further strongly supported this study. Current guidelines would be in conflict with this surgical procedure and would offer TMJ arthrocentesis as a first-line surgical treatment. The time frame over which the data have been collected and the large numbers make this study still an important contributor to the role of temporomandibular joint eminectomy as a second-line surgical option in selected cases, even in modern-day surgical management of refractory closed lock of TM joint.</p><p id="Par29">This large, multi-centred retrospective study carried out at three different centres with consultant-led surgeries shows eminectomy to be a safe and reliable procedure in the treatment of closed lock.

There was complete resolution of a click in 58% of the cases and along with reduction in subjective pain symptoms in 56% cases leading to satisfactory discharge in 108 out of 164 cases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Durham</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Newton-John</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Zakrzewska</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Temporomandibular disorders</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>2015</year><volume>350</volume><fpage>h1154</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmj.h1154</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25767130</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rigon</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bortoluzzi</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Loguercio</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramos</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Cardoso</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Arthroscopy for temporomandibular disorders</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><year>2011</year><volume>11</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>CD006385</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Swift</surname><given-names>JQ</given-names></name><name><surname>Roszkowski</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Alton</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Hargreaves</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of intra-articular versus systemic anti-inflammatory drugs in a rabbit model of temporomandibular joint inflammation</article-title><source>J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>1998</year><volume>56</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>1288</fpage><lpage>1295</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0278-2391(98)90611-5</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9820217</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Baghdadi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Durham</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Araujo-Soares</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Robalino</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Errington</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Steele</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>TMJ Disc displacement without reduction management: a systematic review</article-title><source>J Dent Res</source><year>2014</year><volume>93</volume><issue>7 Suppl</issue><fpage>37S</fpage><lpage>51S</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1177/0022034514528333</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24659775</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stassen</surname><given-names>LF</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Halloran</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Functional surgery of the temporomandibular joint with conscious sedation for &#x0201c;closed lock&#x0201d;
