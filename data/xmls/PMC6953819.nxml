In many hospitals, such patients are treated not only in intensive care units, but also in other wards. In the nineteen eighties, numerous studies demonstrated a wide array of misconceptions and inadequate knowledge related to commonly used sedative, analgesics and muscle relaxants which may prevent appropriate treatment. Since these publications, multiple studies have shown that appropriate sedation and analgesia are associated with improved clinical outcomes, educational programs were developed and guidelines published. Whether the personnel&#x02019;s knowledge kept up with these changes is unknown.

These necessitate the use of validated assessment tools in combination with multidisciplinary management approach and are associated with improved outcomes, reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, reduced infection rate, decrease in the length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Despite the publication of numerous studies and guidelines dealing with sedation and analgesia in ICU, nearly 50% of patients report moderate to severe pain during common procedures performed throughout their hospitalization.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] These procedures, commonly underappreciated as painful by the medical staff, include tracheal suctioning, mobilization and dressing changes. Immobility itself may cause muscle stiffness and pressure ulcers.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] As much as 50% of patients discharged from the ICU remember the pain as their worst experience.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] 30&#x02013;80% of postoperative patients experience moderate to severe pain during hospitalization, which often continues long after discharge from hospital. [<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Unrelieved pain may contribute to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, persistent pain and poor quality of life.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>While appropriate sedation and analgesia may pose its own challenge, the medical staff's knowledge may create additional obstacles and hinder appropriate treatment. Inadequate knowledge and misconceptions related to characteristics and appropriate dosages of sedative, analgesics and muscle relaxants may be one of these factors. Numerous studies published in the 1980&#x02019;s, found that a significant number of critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients might have been treated with muscular blockage agents without concomitant narcotics or sedatives.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In 1989, Loper at al. surveyed the pharmacological knowledge of ICU physicians and nurses regarding the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of narcotics, benzodiazepines and neuromuscular blockers.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The results of their work demonstrated how common these misconceptions are. The findings of these trials are cited in different textbooks and in more than 80 studies.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Since the publication of these worrisome findings, educational programs have been developed, guidelines were published, and new agents were integrated into clinical practice.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The effect of these changes on the clinical knowledge of house-staff, and the rate of misconceptions are unknown.</p><p>In order to estimate the level of knowledge and misconceptions rate, we conducted a survey among physicians and nurses working in a tertiary academic hospital, regarding the pharmacological characteristics of commonly used sedative, analgesic and neuromuscular blocking agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Rambam Health Care Campus (RHCC) Institutional Review Board (approval number RMB-0470-18).

In RHCC mechanically ventilated patients are hospitalized in 5 ICUs (surgical, medical, cardiac, cardio thoracic and neurosurgical), 5 internal medicine and 2 general surgery wards. In addition, mechanically ventilated patients are treated in the Emergency Room (ER) for up to 48 hours. ICUs are staffed by intensive care physicians, cardiologists, neurosurgeons, and thoracic surgeons, during the day shifts, and by anesthesiology, surgery (general, thoracic, neuro-surgery and orthopedics), and internal medicine residents, during the night shifts. Intravenous sedatives, analgesics and neuromuscular blockers are allowed and used, as indicated, in all the departments treating mechanically ventilated patients.</p><p>During December 2018, a link to the digital questionnaire and a cover letter was e-mailed to 426 physicians and 579 nurses working in medical and surgical departments where mechanically ventilated patients are treated. Non-responders were sent the link again via phone text message. The participation was purely voluntary, and by completing the survey it was implied that consent has been given to participate in the study. The surveys were filled out anonymously. The study population was composed of physicians and nurses who electronically submitted the completed forms.

The authors concluded that this situation is unacceptable and raised the alarming possibility that ventilated patients may be paralyzed but aware and suffering from pain. Immediate implementation of educational programs was recommended. [<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] While in the 1980s and 1990s deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade were the common practice, newer guidelines emphasize the analgesia-first concept, the benefits resulting from a lighter level of sedation and the importance to avoid unnecessary muscular blockade.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Another important factor influencing current clinical practice is the fact that in many hospitals mechanically ventilated patients are not managed exclusively in the ICU, but also in surgical and medical wards. [<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Even those physicians and nurses who do not treat mechanically ventilated patients on a regular basis, deal with sedated patients and parenteral analgesia in orthopedic wards, burn units, ERs, and other wards.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In this reality, we expect the medical staff of tertiary academic hospitals to be familiar with the pharmaceutical effect of commonly used sedatives, analgesics, and muscle relaxants.</p><p>Unfortunately, the findings of our study reflect a different and worrisome reality highlighted by high rate of misconceptions among a wide range of medical specialties.</p><p>In our survey, we found that most medical personnel were familiar with the sedative effects of midazolam and propofol, which is becoming the main sedative medication in ICU today.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, almost a third thought that these drugs pose analgesic effects as well. As for opiates, although they were considered to have analgesic properties in almost all questionnaires, a large proportion was unaware that they have a sedative effect.</p><p>These basic misconceptions are in contrary with the guidelines recommending an analgesia- first sedation strategy and may lead medical personnel to provide excessively deep sedation and lack of analgesia on one hand, and to treat patients receiving opiates with unnecessary midazolam or propofol, on the other hand. Such nonessential interventions may cause hemodynamic instability, prolong ventilation and hospitalization, induce delirium and lead to a variety of complications during sedation of spontaneously breathing patients.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Rocuronium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that has no analgesic or sedative effects. However, almost a third of all responders believed it to have sedative properties, and more than ten percent considered it to have an analgesic effect. As much as 40% of emergency room personnel and 17% of ICU staff believed that muscle relaxants have a sedative effect. Using muscle relaxants without concomitant sedatives or analgesics may cause a situation in which patients are aware of their surroundings and feel pain without having the ability to express it. This terrifying scenario has been the subject of descriptive non-medical articles and movies. It is one of the biggest fears people have when they are about to undergo a medical procedure.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The misconception rate regarding the pharmacologic effects of benzodiazepines and propofol was higher among physicians, compared to nurses, while physicians had better knowledge about opiates and muscle relaxants. Senior physicians scored better than their younger colleagues. The fact that more experienced care givers had higher rate of misconceptions regarding sedative effect of muscle relaxants, may reflect an outdated practice of liberal and PRN muscle relaxants administration. Although ICU medical personnel scored better in all the parameters, we believe that the rate of misconceptions among this population is unacceptably high.</p><p>Our findings call for performance of similar surveys in other institutes and for immediate action to improve patients&#x02019; care. There is no doubt that personalized educational programs addressing specific knowledge gaps of each population and periodic obligatory exams are necessary as well as incorporation of safe sedation and analgesia courses into the syllabus of any medical and surgical residency training. However, the fact that the same knowledge deficits present for more than 30 years raise the possibility that more rigid &#x0201c;safeguards&#x0201d; should be employed. These may include elaboration of sedation and analgesia protocols in all departments treating mechanically ventilated patients as well as daily clinical pharmacist review of sedatives, analgesics and paralytics administered. In different fields of medicine, including intensive care, strong evidence supports the use of clinical decision support tools to achieve improvement in care delivery and adherence to medical guidelines.[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Incorporation of automated clinical decision support tools into an electronic health record system of mechanically ventilated patients may assist caregivers in correct selection of medications and may prevent insufficient or excessive sedation and analgesia.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. Being a single center study, its findings may be difficult to generalize to other medical facilities, although the physicians and nurses working in RHCC graduated from different faculties in Israel and abroad, increasing the chance that our findings reflect a more widespread problem. The findings of this study cannot be generalized to centers where ventilated patients are treated solely in ICUs by much smaller and selective group of caregivers. However, we believe that in many countries ventilated patients are treated in variety of medical wards outside ICU. The response rate in our study was 35.32% and it is close to response rates reported in other studies in anesthesiology. [<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The response rates in surveys in other fields ranges between 4 to 64%.

[<xref rid="pone.0227499.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The participation in the survey was voluntary, therefore we believe that most of the responders believed they knew the correct answers. We assume that making the participation obligatory will increase the rate of false answers. Dexmedetomidine was not included in our study because this agent is not available in most ICUs in Israel.</p><p>In summary, this study emphasizes the unsatisfactory situation among nurses and physicians treating critically ill patients who need sedation and analgesia. In this reality, it seems crucial to promote educational programs and elaborate protocols and guidelines in the ICU, and other medical and surgical wards.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227499.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Questionnaire emailed to the participants (English and Hebrew versions).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227499.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Mrs. Anat Shitrit and Mrs. Yael Marcusohn for her contribution to the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227499.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sigakis</surname><given-names>MJG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bittner</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Ten myths and misconceptions regarding pain management in the ICU</article-title>. <source>Crit Care Med</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>43</volume>: <fpage>2468</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>2478</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/CCM.0000000000001256</pub-id>
