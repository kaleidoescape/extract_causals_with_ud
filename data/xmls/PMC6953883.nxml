The plaque accumulation in the brain directly affects reduced levels of A&#x003b2; in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, as A&#x003b2; can freely transport the blood-brain barrier, and clinical investigations have suggested these two biofluids as promising samples for <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnosis. Given that the human eye structurally resembles the brain and A&#x003b2; accumulation often observed in the ocular region of AD patients, in this study, we examined aqueous humor A&#x003b2; as another possible surrogate biomarker. First, using the acute A&#x003b2;-infused AD mouse model by injecting A&#x003b2; to the CSF in intracerebroventricular region of normal ICR mice, we investigated whether A&#x003b2; concentration in the aqueous humor in AD models is positively correlated with the concentration in the CSF. Then, we examined the correlation of aqueous humor A&#x003b2; levels with increased plaque deposition in the brain and reduced A&#x003b2; levels in both CSF and blood in adult and aged 5XFAD Alzheimer transgenic mice. Collectively, the synthetic A&#x003b2; injected into CSF immediately migrate to the aqueous humor, however, the age-dependently reducing pattern of A&#x003b2; levels in CSF and blood was not observed in the aqueous humor.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported partially by National Research Foundation (Basic Science Research Program NRF- 2018R1A6A1A03023718 and 2018R1D1A1B0704885 and Original Technology Research Program for Brain Science NRF-2018M3C7A1021858) and partially by the Korean Health Technology R&#x00026;D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) funded by Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea (HI18C1159).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Abnormally increased production and deposition of the amyloid-&#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;) peptide in human nervous system is a typical characteristic of Alzheimer disease (AD) [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During the pathological progression of AD, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on the membrane of neurons is sequentially cleaved by &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretases and releases excessive A&#x003b2; to the extracellular regions. Although the human brain has efficient clearance systems to remove toxic A&#x003b2; such as protein degradation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) efflux, glymphatic system clearance, and meningeal lymphatic vessel transport [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the A&#x003b2; peptide in high concentration shows misfolding behaviors and begins to accumulate in the brain of AD patients, even before the onset of cognitive deficits [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unfolded monomeric A&#x003b2; is reported to participate in the physiological synaptic processes [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The definitive diagnosis of AD has required the detection of A&#x003b2; deposits in the brain either by biopsy, autopsy, or positron emission tomography along with the signs of neurodegeneration [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) was suggested as an alternative biomarker for the amyloid concentration measurement by the 2018 revision of AD diagnostic criteria by National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association (NIA-AA) [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Measurements of CSF A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) show high diagnostic accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227618.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is notable that, while A&#x003b2; concentration increase and soluble oligomers and insoluble plaques build up in the brain, the alteration of A&#x003b2; levels in CSF shows a proportionally inverse behavior. The concentration of CSF A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) in AD patients is reduced compared to normal adults, inversely indicating the A&#x003b2; deposition in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite the stacked evidence, CSF A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) level is not routinely used in the clinical AD cases due to the complicated sample collection procedure [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227618.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Clinical investigations searching for the less invasive biomarkers focused on blood A&#x003b2; for its clear BBB transporting mechanism through low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and, thus, anticipated role to directly reflect the A&#x003b2; alterations in CSF. Since the analytical results have the discrepancy between the studies [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227618.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the usage of plasma A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) level as a biomarker has not been consolidated in medical practice [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is attributed to the systemic circulation nature of plasma, where the protein level can be affected by the peripheral cleavage of APP or vascular risk factors [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential to explore the novel biofluid to accurately reflect the pathologic changes of AD.</p><p>The human eye has neural similarities with the brain containing high-density of neurons and glia cells and has blood barrier [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Given the shared functional and structural features of brain and ocular tissues, it is no surprise that the eye has been studied as a window of the brain [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Previously, the lens and retina regions were reported to excessively produce A&#x003b2; and show accumulation of the soluble and insoluble aggregates of the peptide [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For the ease of <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnosis, among many ocular regions, we focused on the eye fluid, the aqueous humor, in the anterior chamber [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227618.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Aqueous humor shares similar characteristics with CSF and plasma to contain a complex mixture of proteins [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As the eye lack efficient amyloid clearance systems compared to the brain, the aqueous humor might not directly mirror A&#x003b2; level alteration in CSF [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A previous study reported that the higher A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;40) level was detected in aqueous humor of AD patients [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we examined the potent surrogate biomarker role of the aqueous humor A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) to reflect the AD manifestation. To investigate the correlation of A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) level in the aqueous humor with that in the brain, the CSF, and the blood, we conducted a series of <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments using two, A&#x003b2;-infused and transgenic (TG), Alzheimer mouse models. The A&#x003b2;-infused mouse model bypasses the ageing and APP processing steps and allow us to control the region-specific concentration changes of A&#x003b2;. After the injection of monomeric A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) directly into the intracerebroventricular (ICV) of the mouse brain in time- and dose-dependent manner, we measured levels of CSF, blood plasma, and aqueous humor A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) to examine if A&#x003b2; is transported from CSF to the aqueous humor. To further investigate the surrogate biomarker role of aqueous humor A&#x003b2;, we used the 5XFAD TG mouse model expresses human A&#x003b2; in its central and peripheral nervous system. We collected brain, CSF, blood plasma, and aqueous humor samples of adult and aged 5XFAD in both male and female genders and compared changes of A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals models</title><p>Transgenic mouse (strain name; B6SJL-Tg(APPSwFlLon,PSEN1*M146L*L286V) 6799Vas/Mmjax) carrying five mutations associated with early onset familial Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (FAD) was used in the experiment.

Thus, transgenic mice with human APP mutation genes are useful models to investigate amyloid cascade and related pathology of AD patients.

The tendency of the aqueous humor was different with that of CSF or plasma, both of which showed decreasing trend along the ages. It can be presumed that the amount of A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) in the aqueous humor is more derived from APP peripheral cleavage in the ocular tissues than that from the CSF or plasma [<xref rid="pone.0227618.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227618.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In female TG mice, A&#x003b2;(1&#x02013;42) levels of the aqueous humor were more closely associated with the amyloid plaque burden in the brain rather than those of the CSF, independent of the migration that occurs. Unlike the clear tendency in females, no significant differences between adult and aged mice were identified in males.

They show increased levels of Ab42 in AHF of dTG mice at 12 and 24 months of age, they also report a slight increase between the age group. Using ICV model the author show that injected A&#x003b2; reaches the AHF in a time- and dose-dependent manner.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>This could have been a very interesting paper if the authors have had executed the experiment in whole and presented all their data. Currently it appears they just show a selection of the data that support their claim. The data on CSF A&#x003b2; and the A&#x003b2; deposits in the brain of TG animals is missing. They hence do not show if A&#x003b2; is accumulated in AHF in relation to CSF and the brain A&#x003b2; (levels/deposits), allowing them to examine if AHF A&#x003b2; can be useful as a surrogate marker for AD diagnosis. The ICV experiment is also not complete as they should have tested iv injection of A&#x003b2; in circulation to perhaps be able to substantiate the route of A&#x003b2; to AHF. These shortcomings allow the authors to make just one single conclusion that ICV injected A&#x003b2; can reach the AHF. This is insufficient however to establish that AHF A&#x003b2; can be used or is useful as a surrogate biomarker for CSF A&#x003b2; for AD diagnosis.</p><p>Thus many of conclusions and statements of the authors are either misgiving and or unjustified, as follows below:</p><p>1)- in 230-232, as this sentence gives a generalized expression rather than what the authors can claim in this particular experiment. Rephrase perhaps as follows: &#x0201c;This specific animal model showed that ICV injected A&#x003b2; reaches the AHF fluid&#x0201d;. You cannot rule out other sources at all as the ICR animals are not TG and your A&#x003b2; ELISA is human specific. Even if the animals were TG the experiment could not rule out peripheral sources by mere ICV injection and concentration changes, since even in TG there should be a pre-established equilibrium and ICV A&#x003b2; injection just add to this level.</p><p>2)- Also the conclusion in line 240-241 has to be carefully revised as it is, it is greatly misgiving. If you inject A&#x003b2; in circulation and then measure it in AHF vs CSF, you could perhaps make such a conclusion but as it is this claim is just one of several possibilities. In addition, such an information is useless (in the context of your manuscript) unless you can show that it is accumulated in AHF. Otherwise, why measure A&#x003b2; in AHF or CSF (for that matter) if you can measure it in plasma?</p><p>3)- The sentence in line 242-244 (&#x0201c;It is assured &#x02026; TG mice&#x0201d;) is also not correct/justified in the present study. CSF A&#x003b2; is a biomarker of AD because of its altered levels in AD vs control and its inverse association with the amount of A&#x003b2; deposits in the brain but not merely because A&#x003b2; can be measured in CSF (as control subjects have much higher levels of A&#x003b2; in the CSF than AD).</p><p>4)- Also consider the following shortcoming of the study: You might have been able to provide some clues if you had measured changes in AHF A&#x003b2; in relation to CSF A&#x003b2; and the A&#x003b2; deposits in the brain of the TG animal to establish that levels of A&#x003b2; in AHF like that in CSF reflect the extend of A&#x003b2; deposits in the brain. Thus currently, the Fig 1 results does not really say much as the comparison between TG vs WT has limited value since your A&#x003b2; ELISA can only measure human A&#x003b2;. The main interesting point in Fig. 1 is the A&#x003b2; level at 12 vs 24 months but since you do not show the levels of plaques and the levels of A&#x003b2; in CSF you cannot establish a proper relationship to point out AHF A&#x003b2; as a surrogate biomarker.</p><p>5)- In Abstract, line 26-28. The author claim that they &#x0201c;&#x02026; investigated whether the A&#x003b2; in the aqueous humor in AD models is directly correlated with the misfolding protein of the central nervous system.&#x0201d; You did not do such an investigation in this study as far as I can deduct from your experiment. As a matter of fact your ICV model reject your statement as you cannot claim (and it is very unlikely) that the synthetic A&#x003b2; monomers were all misfolded (not to mention that even in TG or human, one cannot claim that the soluble A&#x003b2; peptides are misfolded even though many believe so mainly because of confusion that aggregation can only occur due to misfolding of A&#x003b2; peptides and neglect that aggregation may also occur simply because of an excessive accumulation in e.g. parenchymal fluid in the brain.</p><p>Other issues:</p><p>1. ICR (mice) is not defined in abstract or the rest of the text.</p><p>2. Is the Age-dependent increase in AHF A&#x003b2; significant? Provide p-values!</p><p>3. Why didn&#x02019;t you measure A&#x003b2; in serum, CSF and brain extracts of dTG?</p><p>4. To ascertain route of A&#x003b2; to AHF, why not also inject A&#x003b2; iv in circulation, which is much easier to do and would provide additional information?</p><p>5. In Fig 3, plasma A&#x003b2;42 at 4 nmole ICV injection is missing.</p><p>6. In Fig 3, it is difficult to appreciate the importance/significant of the comparisons with the highest conc group (i.e. 4 nmol group), particularly since there is no difference between 0.5 vs 1 nmol-groups or 2 vs 4 nmol groups (in 3B)? It is important here that direct correlation graphs plus their r- and p-values are shown, as well.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Reviewer Comments to Editor:</p><p>Recommendation: Accept after major revision.</p><p>Reviewer Comments to Author:</p><p>Globally, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is a growing health and economic challenge that has no effective cure. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and pathological hallmarks include presence of hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid protein deposition. Currently, these pathological biomarkers are detected either through cerebrospinal fluid analysis or brain imaging. Though effective, these methods are not widely available due to issues such as the difficulty in acquiring samples, lack of infrastructure or high cost associated.</p><p>The authors have previously reported a direct correlation of A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;42) levels between CSF and plasma in AD mouse model by injecting monomeric A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;42) directly into the intracerebroventricular (ICV) region of normal adult mouse brains to induce AD-like phenotypes. In this manuscript, Kwak et al. reported that presence of A&#x003b2; (1-42) in the aqueous humor can be used as a surrogate bio-marker of perturbed A&#x003b2; levels in central nervous systems of AD.</p><p>This manuscript is well written, concise, easy-to-follow and provides a new insight on the potential bio-markers for AD patients.</p><p>I support its acceptance provided the major revisions as noted below are adequately addressed:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>&#x02022; Well-organized and well written.</p><p>&#x02022; Since the word limit is 300, I would suggest authors to include few sentences of background information.</p><p>&#x02022; Preferable to be consistent with either A&#x003b2; (1-42) or amyloid beta.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>&#x02022; In the first paragraph, few sentences are written without any citations. Citations would strengthen use point of emphasis.</p><p>&#x02022; It is advisable to revise last paragraph where the author&#x02019;s discuses about the experiment protocol instead of focusing on the importance of their study.</p><p>&#x02022; Please include one sentence showing the novelty and importance of your study.</p><p>Materials and Methods:</p><p>&#x02022; In experiment 2, please elaborate how the aqueous humor at different time point from the same mice were collected.</p><p>Results:</p><p>&#x02022; The authors have used male transgenic mice in their experiments whereas several studies (refer to the journals: PMID: 30820070, PMID: 26987699, PMID: 20442496) have reported that the incidence of AD is higher in females. So, I would suggest to repeat the experiments in female mice model to make the data more authenticate to the clinical data.</p><p>&#x02022; Since hyperphosphorylated tau has been found in both AD and Glaucoma, suggesting a possible pathophysiologic link between the two diseases (PMID: 26425322), but no attempt was made to quantify hyperphosphorylated tau in this study.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors measured the A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;42) concentration in CSF by injecting different concentration of A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;42) into the ICV region of normal adult ICR mice by following their previous study. But, the result showed significant differences (around 5-folds higher in this study compare to the previous result) between two studies. Why this discrepancy.</p><p>&#x02022; In the description of figure 1 results, the authors claimed that human A&#x003b2; (1-42) was not found in the aqueous humor of WT mice, but in figure 1 bar data, it clearly showed the presence of some amount A&#x003b2; (1-42) in WT.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors claimed that A&#x003b2; transport from the central nervous system to the eye is through blood. So, I would recommend to perform the experiment for A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;42) concentration in plasma also to see how much A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;42) transported to the aqueous humor through the blood.</p><p>&#x02022; In figure 2B, the authors measured the half-time of A&#x003b2; efflux from CSF to blood and their finding is consistent with the work done by Shibata M. et al. (2000). In addition, Shibata M. et al. (2000) also mentioned that there was also a slow, time-dependent retention of A&#x003b2; in brain parenchyma with a t1/2 of 164.5 minutes. But, figure 2B shows after 34.63 minutes, release of A&#x003b2; is suddenly stopped from the brain which is not consistent with the Shibata study, i.e. there is no time-dependent retention of A&#x003b2; in brain.</p><p>&#x02022; For figure 2B &#x00026; 3C, the authors followed the same procedure (injecting monomeric A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;42) directly into the intracerebroventricular (ICV) region of normal adult mouse brains), used same concentration (4nmole), same time point (30 minutes). But, why two different A&#x003b2; (1-42) concentrations.</p><p>&#x02022; More labels are necessary in Figs 2A &#x00026; 3A.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>&#x02022; The authors should discuss more about how the A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;42) is transported into the aqueous humor through blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This is a generally well written and interesting paper about the significantly increased levels of A&#x003b2; in the aqueous humour of transgenic AD mouse model in comparison to WT, and the ability to measure acutely perturbated levels of CSF A&#x003b2; in both the plasma and the aqueous humour of ICR mice, demonstrating that A&#x003b2; introduced to CSF is transported into aqueous humour.</p><p>There are some grammatical errors, as well as some questions regarding the statistics and presentation of your data that I have listed in the sections below.</p><p>In general, where you say central nervous system, please change to CSF for better clarity, as you are referring to soluble A&#x003b2;(1-42).</p><p>Abstract</p><p>&#x02022; Line 25: &#x0201c;Based on the clinical evidence&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Line 27: Please clarify what specifically is correlated; i.e. presence/concentration of A&#x003b2; in aqueous humour is positively correlated with the presence/concentration if A&#x003b2; in CSF</p><p>&#x02022; Line 31: Consider changing wording, i.e. &#x0201c;To investigate the correlation between A&#x003b2; levels in CSF and aqueous humour, we&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Line 37: Consider changing conclusion wording, i.e. &#x0201c;Our results indicate that A&#x003b2; peptides are elevated in the aqueous humour in AD mice.

Please include the statistical test for normality, and provide a table summarising the numerical mean &#x000b1; SD for each group</p><p>&#x02022; Please include the F-value, and degrees of freedom, for each p-value you have given for Figure 1</p><p>&#x02022; Line 153: Please perform a statistical analysis to determine whether levels of A&#x003b2;(1-42) are significantly different between TG 12 months and TG 24 months</p><p>o If all datasets are normally distributed with equal variance, consider doing a one-way ANOVA for all 4 datasets, and then perform a Tukey post hoc test to determine which means are significantly different from each other amongst all 4 groups</p><p>&#x02022; Line 154: Please change &#x0201c;subjects&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;in ageing TG mice&#x0201d;; also, please reword this sentence, the logic is not clear.</p><p>&#x02022; Line 157: Please change &#x0201c;the eye&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;aqueous humour&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x02022; Line 187: In the caption for Figure 2, please change &#x0201c;central nervous system&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;CSF&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;eye&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;aqueous humour&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Line 195: please change &#x0201c;central nervous system&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;CSF&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;eye&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;aqueous humour&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Line 209: please change to &#x0201c;&#x02026;that acute changes in the concentration of A&#x003b2;(1-42) in the CSF&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Line 212: This sentence needs a citation</p><p>&#x02022; Please perform a correlation between levels of A&#x003b2;(1-42) in CSF and A&#x003b2;(1-42) in aqueous humour to show how strongly these are related, include the resulting r2 value and statistics to support statements regarding the &#x0201c;significant correlation&#x0201d; e.g. line 222, and generate a figure showing this data</p><p>&#x02022; Please include the sample size for each time point as a legend, and state in the figure caption whether you have plotted mean &#x000b1; SD or mean &#x000b1; SEM</p><p>&#x02022; In Figure 2, the level of A&#x003b2;(1-42) in aqueous humour after 4 nmole ICV injection was approx. 6000 pg/mL, however in Figure 3, the level of A&#x003b2;(1-42) in aqueous humour after 4nmole ICV injection appears to be half of this, at approx. 3000 pg/mL. Can you comment on why you think this may be the case, as the protocol was the same?</p><p>&#x02022; For Figure 3, you state you have plotted mean &#x000b1; SEM, however it appears you have used box plots. Please clarify what you have plotted. If they are box plots, this is a good indication of the spread of your data, but please also provide mean &#x000b1; SD values in a table.</p><p>&#x02022; You have used a one-way ANOVA to determine whether the levels of A&#x003b2;(1-42) in CSF, aqueous humour and plasma are significantly different following different injection concentrations, which assumes that datasets are normally distributed and have equal variances. Please include the statistical tests for normality.</p><p>&#x02022; For the data provided in Figure 3, please report the F-values and degrees of freedom from your one-way ANOVA. Also, please clarify which pairwise comparison was significantly different, either on the figure with brackets, or in a table.</p><p>&#x02022; Please include the data for level of A&#x003b2;(1-42) in plasma when 4 nmole of A&#x003b2;(1-42) was injected, or provide details regarding why this data point was excluded from Figure 3D</p><p>Discussion</p><p>&#x02022; Line 228 should read &#x0201c;A&#x003b2; levels in CSF and aqueous humour&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Line 230: Is this statement accurate? To my understanding, although ICR mouse does not specifically express human APP, this mouse model still expresses endogenous murine APP which may produce A&#x003b2; which may be detected by ELISA. In addition to this, your WT control had detectable levels of A&#x003b2; in aqueous. Better evidence of the movement of A&#x003b2; from CSF to aqueous humour would be the change in A&#x003b2; concentration over time, as well as the significant changes in A&#x003b2; levels in aqueous when you alter injected CSF A&#x003b2; concentrations.</p><p>&#x02022; Line 239: You may also wish to add, to further support your argument, that it is known that aqueous humour is composed of blood plasma (REF), and it is believed that aqueous humour proteins are derived from blood plasma, rather than synthesised locally inside the eye (REF).</p><p>&#x02022; Line 240: &#x0201c;Thus, it is possible&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Line 242: Consider discussing results in the order that they have been presented e.g. WT vs. TG, then ICV injection to ICR mice</p><p>&#x02022; Line 245: &#x0201c;known to precede other processes like the&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>References</p><p>&#x02022; Line 280 should be &#x0201c;References&#x0201d;</p><p>Minor Comments</p><p>&#x02022; In my version, the figures look pixelated (e.g. text is hard to read in Figure 3).
