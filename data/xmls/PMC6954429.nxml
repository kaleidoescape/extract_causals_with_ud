The determinants that mediate IRF-specific enhancer selection are not fully understood. To uncover regions occupied predominantly by IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;or IRF9, we performed ChIP-seq experiments in activated murine dendritic cells. The identified regions were analysed with respect to the enrichment of DNA motifs, the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and ISRE half-site variants, and chromatin accessibility. Using a machine learning method, we investigated the predictability of IRF-dominance. We found that IRF5-dominant regions differed fundamentally from the IRF3- and IRF9-dominant regions: ISREs were rare, while the NFKB motif and special ISRE half-sites, such as 5&#x02032;-GAGA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GACA-3&#x02032;, were enriched. IRF3- and IRF9-dominant regions were characterized by the enriched ISRE motif and lower frequency of accessible chromatin. Enrichment analysis and the machine learning method uncovered the features that favour IRF3 or IRF9 dominancy (e.g. a tripartite form of ISRE and motifs for NF-&#x003ba;B for IRF3, and the GAS motif and certain ISRE variants for IRF9). This study contributes to our understanding of how IRF members, which bind overlapping sets of DNA sequences, can initiate signal-dependent responses without activating superfluous or harmful programmes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Hungarian Scientific Research Fund</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003549</named-content></funding-source><award-id>NN125613</award-id><award-id>PD 124843</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Hungarian Academy of Sciences</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003825</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Economic Development and Innovation Operational Programme</named-content></funding-source><award-id>3Z5SBKC0FUNO119</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family is comprised of nine members (IRF1&#x02013;IRF9) in mammals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). IRFs play important roles, not only in interferon (IFN) induction, but also in cell development, cell-intrinsic antiviral responses, inflammation, and oncogenesis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Within the IRF family, IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 have been identified as key regulators of various antiviral and inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Upon stimulation by specific pathways, IRF3 and IRF5 undergo posttranslational modifications (mainly phosphorylation), resulting in activation, nuclear translocation, dimerization or complex formation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). IRF3 and IRF5 are phosphorylated by protein kinases, which are activated by signalling pathways of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that signal via TRIF (TLR3 and TLR4) and MyD88 (e.g. TLR7 and TLR9), respectively (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The binding of type I IFNs to their receptors results in the activation of a heterotrimeric transcriptional activator known as IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which consists of IRF9 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition to the canonical ISGF3, complexes containing IRF9 and either STAT1 or STAT2, but not both, also control gene expression (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Notably, the IRF association domain (IAD) of IRF9 lacks the autoinhibitory element, explaining previous notions that activation by signal-induced phosphorylation may not be necessary for association of IRF9 with STAT2 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, an early study suggested that IRF9 could be phosphorylated constitutively within the DNA-binding domain (DBD) in the absence of IFN stimuli (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 regulate overlapping but distinct sets of target genes. IRF3 induces the production of many antiviral cytokines, including IFN-&#x003b2;, CCL5, CXCL9&#x000a0;and CXCL10 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). IRF5 is involved in inflammatory responses, as demonstrated by impaired inflammatory cytokine production in <italic>Irf5</italic>-deficient mice (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Besides these prominent roles, IRF3 and IRF5 contribute to other biological processes as well (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>). In the ISGF3 complex, IRF9 is an essential mediator of IFN signalling and a transcriptional regulator of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) involved in the establishment of the so-called antiviral state (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Notably, a subset of ISGs, such as <italic>Ifit1</italic> and <italic>Isg15</italic>, is also regulated directly by the TLR3 pathway via IRF3 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). IRFs frequently co-bind with other TFs at the promoter regions or at distal enhancers of the regulated genes. The co-binding of IRFs and members of AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B families has been well documented (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Human IFNB activation by Sendai virus infection demonstrates the central role of co-operative binding and synergy between NF-&#x003ba;B, IRF3/IRF7&#x000a0;and ATF-2/c-Jun in selective transcriptional activation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). ChIP-seq analysis revealed an extensive collaboration of IRF3 and RelA in the antiviral responses (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). During viral infection, IRF3 and NF-&#x003ba;B drive both <italic>de novo</italic> polymerase recruitment and mediate the release of paused Pol II at their target sites (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). IRF5 binding also co-occurs frequently with RelA binding, at the promoter of genes that are strongly induced by LPS in macrophages (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Selectivity in gene activation is a well-documented phenomenon for IRFs, and gene-targeting studies performed on IRFs have revealed the markedly diverse roles played by these transcription factors (TFs) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Selective gene activation is critical for limiting potential superfluous or harmful transcriptional events. For example, after activation by inflammatory agents, IRF5 induces inflammatory cytokines, without activating antiviral ISGs. Similarly, type I IFN-activated ISGF3 establishes an antiviral state without activating the production of type I IFNs, because this would lead to an &#x02018;IFN storm&#x02019; (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>Dimers or trimers formed by IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 regulate gene expression via indirect mechanisms or direct DNA binding (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The indirect mechanisms and their relative contribution to gene regulation are not completely understood. In contrast, the mechanism of direct DNA binding and IRF-bound DNA sequences have been extensively investigated using protein binding microarrays (PBM), electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and protein crystallization methods (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref>). DNA motifs, which are enriched in the binding regions, have been identified by ChIP-seq for many IRFs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The canonical binding sequence for IRF dimers is called the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE, 5&#x02032;-GAAANNGAAA-3&#x02032;) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref>). ISREs are occupied by IRF homo- or heterodimers, or by the ISGF3 complex, while a single molecule of IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 binds to the ISRE half-site (5&#x02032;-GAAA-3&#x02032;).</p><p>Many DNA sequences have been identified, which are bound more efficiently by one IRF than another. Bases, which have been associated with IRF-specific binding, are localized in the 4-bp ISRE half-sites, in the 2-bp spacer between half-sites, or in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; flanking regions (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref>). The existence of shared and IRF-specific binding sequences provides a potential mechanism for the IRFs to regulate both common and dimer-specific genes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, the contribution of these sequences to IRF-specific binding has not been evaluated by genome-wide ChIP-seq studies. In the current study, our starting assumption was that DNA sequences that play a role in enhancer selection by these IRFs and their dimerization and trimerization partners are enriched in the binding regions occupied dominantly by IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;or IRF9. We also postulated that if chromatin accessibility and collaborating TFs contribute to IRF-specific binding, the binding regions would differ from each other in terms of chromatin status and the presence of co-binding TF DNA motifs. To test these hypotheses and to determine which features contribute to IRF-specific binding, we identified and characterized binding regions for IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 in stimulated dendritic cells (DCs). Our analysis indicates that IRF-specificity in enhancer selection is mediated by DNA sequences occupied directly by IRFs, and additional features in a combinatorial fashion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cells and ligands</title><p>A wild-type CD8<sup>+</sup> dendritic cell line (MuTu1940) was established and cultured as described previously (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). For ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR experiments, CD8<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) were treated for 90 min with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml of high molecular weight polyinosinic&#x02013;polycytidylic acid (pIC, InvivoGen), 1 mM class B CpG oligonucleotide 1826 (CpG, InvivoGen)&#x000a0;or 100 U/ml interferon-&#x003b2; (IFN-&#x003b2;, Millipore) or a combination of these ligands. The binding sites of IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 were determined in DCs stimulated by pIC, CpG and IFN-&#x003b2;, respectively. The binding of cRel and Junb was determined in CpG-stimulated and unstimulated DCs. For gene expression qPCR experiments, CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs were treated for 1.5, 3, 6&#x000a0;or 12&#x000a0;h with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml pIC, 1 mM CpG or 100 U/ml IFN-&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments were performed as previously described (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;42</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, 10&#x02013;20 million DCs were crosslinked with 2 mM disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, ProteoChem) for 40 min and 1% methanol-free formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M for 10 min followed by addition of ChIP lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS with protease inhibitors (cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). Chromatin was sheared with sonication (Diagenode Bioruptor Standard) and immunoprecipitated overnight using antibodies against IRF3 (D83B9, Cell Signaling), IRF5 (ab21689, Abcam), IRF9 (AF5629, R&#x00026;D Systems), cRel (sc-71x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Junb (sc-46x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chromatin-antibody complexes were washed and eluted after being pulled down with magnetic beads (Protein A or G Dynabeads, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eluted complexes were de-crosslinked overnight and purified using a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Nagel). ChIP-DNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer. For ChIP-seq experiments indexed cDNA libraries were prepared from 1 to&#x000a0;10 ng ChIP-DNA using a TruSeq ChIP Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 or HiSeq 2500 platforms. For ChIP-qPCR experiments primers were designed for amplifying the promoter regions of the nine paradigm genes and enrichment was determined by qPCR relative to input using the ready-to-use hot start reaction mix, LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche) and the LightCycler 480 Instrument (Roche).

Briefly, Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Tool (bwa, (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>)) was used to align the reads with the mm10 genome assembly, and Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq 2 (MACS2, (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>)) was used for predicting peaks (binding regions) with the following specific parameters: qvalue cut-off (<italic>q</italic>) = 0.001 and subpeaks deconvolved within each peak (&#x02013;call-summits). Artifacts were removed using the ENCODE blacklist (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The identified peak summits were extended by &#x000b1;100 bp to obtain binding regions. Consensus peak sets for each IRF contain the common peaks of the duplicates. By merging binding regions of IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9, a &#x02018;unified IRF3/IRF5/IRF9 cistrome&#x02019; was generated. Coverage of predicted peaks (expressed as Reads Per Kilobase Million, RPKM) was calculated using bamtools, bedtools (coverageBed), and awk. For clustering, occupancy values were normalized by the median of values of each IRF. Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, Broad Institute) was used for data browsing and creating representative snapshots (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Genome coverage files (BedGraphs) were converted into tdf files using igvtools with the &#x02018;toTDF&#x02019; option. Normalized tag counts for read distribution (RD) histograms and heat maps were generated by HOMER (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and then visualized by R or Java TreeView.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-4"><title>IDR analysis</title><p>Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) analysis&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>)&#x000a0;was used to quantify the consistency between replicates.

<italic>De novo</italic> motif discovery, PWM enrichment analysis, and the search for DNA sequences</title><p>200 bp long regions were used for motif enrichment analyses, performed by findMotifsGenome.pl (HOMER). <italic>P</italic>-values were calculated by comparing the target region enrichments with those of background sets generated by HOMER. Position weight matrices (PWMs) for ISRE, EICE, AICE1, NFKB, TRE, CRE and GAS motifs were obtained from the HOMER database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). PWMs for IECS, AICE2&#x000a0;and TISRE were not available in the database; therefore, PWMs were generated by re-analyzing publicly available ChIP-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The threshold values (cut-offs) for each motif were determined based on a set of randomly selected, size-matched genomic regions (random set). The 95th percentile value of each motif was used as a cut-off. Mapping of PWMs in the genome was performed by scanMotifGenomeWide.pl (HOMER). Calculation of motif scores in IRF binding regions was performed by annotatePeaks.pl (HOMER). For searching special DNA sequences in the clusters, lists of 6-mers and ISRE variants were generated. The DNA sequence of each binding region was obtained from the mouse genome (GRCm38/mm10) using bedtools (fastaFromBed). Using grep command, we searched for all 6-mers and ISRE variants and their reverse complements in all binding regions. The position of the GAANNGAAA sequence was determined genome-wide using the R package Biostrings.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-6"><title>ATAC-seq experiments and data analysis</title><p>Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) was carried out in biological duplicates as described earlier with minor modifications (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Cells were scraped and counted to achieve 10 000&#x02013;15 000/ml in ice-cold PBS. Nuclei were isolated with ATAC lysis buffer (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000a0;and 0.1% IGEPAL). Nuclei were used for tagmentation from two biological replicates using a Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). After tagmentation, DNA was purified with a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN). Tagmented DNA was amplified with Kapa Hifi Hot Start Kit (Kapa Biosystems) using nine PCR cycles. Amplified libraries were purified again with MinElute PCR Purification Kit. Fragment distribution of libraries was assessed with Agilent Bioanalyzer and libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Similarly to ChIP-seq analysis, primary analysis of the ATAC-seq raw reads was carried out using an analysis command line pipeline. Briefly, bwa was used to align the reads with the mm10 genome assembly using default parameters and MACS2 was used for predicting ATAC-seq peaks (<italic>q</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.001). Artifacts were removed using the ENCODE blacklist. Genome coverage files (BedGraphs) for visualization purposes were generated with makeUCSCfile.pl and then converted into tdf files using igvtools with the &#x02018;toTDF&#x02019; option. IGV was used for data browsing and creating representative snapshots. For calculating the ratio of ATAC-positive regions, the overlap between the IRF binding regions and ATAC-seq peaks was determined using &#x02018;bedtools intersect&#x02019;. For the identification of ATAC-positive IRF-binding regions by &#x02018;bedtools intersect&#x02019;, we used the ATAC sample, which contained more identified ATAC-seq peaks.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-7"><title>Ternary diagrams</title><p>An R software package, &#x02018;ggtern&#x02019;, was used to create the ternary diagrams that show the ratios between the three variables (median normalized IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 occupancy values). A given point on the ternary diagram represents one binding region, and the three input variables for a given point are the median-normalized occupancy values of the IRFs in the given region. Colour gradients for NFKB, TRE, CRE, GAS and ATAC are based on motif similarity scores or RPKM values.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-8"><title>PCA and machine learning</title><p>For Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the scikit-learn Python library was used, and two principal components were computed.

PCA was run on the three IRFs&#x02019; occupancy values for one plot, and on 11 enhancer features for the other.&#x000a0;PCA was visualized with matplotlib, a Python library for 2D plotting. The Random Forest machine learning method was applied in Python using the RandomForestClassifier from the scikit-learn package. The motif scores for ten PWMs, ATAC-seq signals, and occurrence data concerning 37 variants of ISRE and 30 selected 6-mers were used as attributes of the binding regions. Various sets of these values were used as input variables for Random Forest, while cluster names were used as &#x02018;class labels&#x02019;. The Random Forest method not only provided prediction accuracy, but also reported the relative importance of the features (&#x02018;feature importance&#x02019; or &#x02018;predictive power&#x02019;). For selecting 6-mers with high predictive power, we performed nine Random Forest classification using the occurrence data of all 6-mers (<italic>n</italic> = 535) and running three analyses for each comparison (TLR3-dom. versus TLR5-dom., TLR3-dom. versus TLR9-dom. and TLR5-dom. versus TLR9-dom). The 6-mers were ranked based on their cumulative importance scores calculated from the nine scores. Based on additional test runs, we decided to use the &#x02018;Top 30&#x02019; 6-mers, because accuracies were not increased significantly, when more than thirty 6-mers were used for the predictions.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-9"><title>ROC curves and AUC values</title><p>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the ability of different motifs to separate two datasets with the Random Forest classifier algorithm. The algorithm performed binary classification using the IRF dominant and IRF cistrome datasets pairwise, with the given motifs scores as its input features. The dataset was split into training and test sets. The analysis uses the scikit-learn Python library for both running the machine learning algorithm and calculating and visualizing the ROC curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) value. The classifier gives a probability estimate for both of the class labels, which shows what the probability of a given record from the test set is in that class. The ROC curve shows how the classifiers perform with different cutoff values of the prediction probabilities.

If the occupancy values for IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 on a given binding regions were similar (0.5 &#x0003c; ratio &#x0003c; 2), the region was considered to be a common binding region for IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 (referred to as a &#x02018;Common cluster&#x02019;).

Consistent with previous IRF5 ChIP-seq studies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery failed to detect an ISRE motif in the IRF5-dominant cluster. However, an ISRE half-site motif and a weak IRF-Ets composite sequence (IECS) (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), were enriched in this cluster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In addition to these IRF-binding motifs, several other motifs were identified, including the NF-&#x003ba;B-binding motif (&#x003ba;B or NFKB), the TPA response element (TRE), the cAMP response elements (CRE)&#x000a0;and the gamma IFN activation site (GAS). These motifs are binding sites for TFs that are co-activated with IRFs in a pathway-specific manner. Upon TLR ligation, IRF3 or IRF5 are activated together with activating protein 1 (AP-1) members, which bind TRE or CRE (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and members of the NF-&#x003ba;B family, which bind to &#x003ba;B sites (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). I-IFNs induce the formation of the ISGF3 complex together with STAT1 homodimers, which bind to GAS (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59&#x02013;61</xref>).

Moreover, a direct comparison of motif enrichment in different clusters is not feasible. Our second approach compared the enrichment of the same PWMs in the clusters side-by-side. We obtained PWMs from the HOMER database or from reanalysed ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In addition to ISRE, EICE, IECS and the motifs for co-activated TFs, we investigated three longer motifs. Two composite elements for AP-1 and IRF (AICE1 and AICE2) were identified as binding sites for IRF4 and/or IRF8 and their co-binding TFs (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62&#x02013;66</xref>). A tripartite form of ISRE (called hereafter as &#x02018;TISRE&#x02019;), which was previously identified as binding sites for IRF1, IRF2&#x000a0;and IRF8 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) was also included in the analysis. We determined the threshold (cut-off) values for each motif systematically, based on a set of randomly selected size-matched genomic regions (random set) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). We then calculated the PWM enrichment relative to the random set (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>). We made the following four observations. First, as expected, ISRE was the most enriched motif in the IRF3- and IRF9-dominant cluster, while it was poorly enriched in the IRF5-dominant cluster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Second, TISRE was especially frequent in the IRF3-dominant cluster. Third, the enrichment of the EICE motif was similar to the ISREs&#x02019; in the investigated clusters. These results do not imply necessarily that IRF3-dimers and ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9) bind EICE motif with a high frequency. More likely, IRF3-dimers and ISGF3 show a preference for accessible genomic regions that are primed by PU.1 and IRF8. These two TFs are lineage-determining TFs in this DC subtype (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), and together they bind EICE and IECS (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Last, <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery results and the enrichment analysis of PWMs for co-activated TFs agreed in most cases. Most co-activated TF motifs, which were detected with the low <italic>p</italic>-value by the <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery, were enriched in the IRF dominant clusters; NFKB, TRE, and CRE motifs in the IRF3-dominant cluster, NFKB in the IRF5-dominant cluster, and GAS in the IRF9-dominant cluster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The only discrepancy was observed in the IRF5-dominant cluster, where TRE and CRE motifs were enriched by <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery, but not by PWM analysis. The differences in the enrichments are coming from the fact that <italic>de novo</italic> determined PWMs are similar but not identical to the PWMs obtained from the HOMER database (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>), and only <italic>de novo</italic> determined PWMs were enriched. We also investigated the distribution of binding regions, which contained sequences with high motif scores for co-activated TFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Since motif scores signify similarities between the identified DNA sequences and the used PWMs, these sites typically represent high affinity binding sites. We found that NFKB motifs with high scores were polarized in the IRF3- and IRF5-dominant clusters, while regions containing GAS motifs with high scores were specially enriched in the IRF9-dominant cluster. In the case of TRE and CRE motifs, a modest IRF3- and IRF5-biased polarization was detectable. PWM enrichment analysis for the other four clusters is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>. Previous studies demonstrated that many genes are co-regulated by I-IFN and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). The low frequency of the NFKB motif in the IRF9-dominant cluster raised the question of what types of binding regions could be responsible for the cross-talk between I-IFN and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways. By analysing the frequency of NFKB motifs in the clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>) and the binding regions associated with genes co-regulated by I-IFN and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways, we concluded that binding regions occupied by IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 (Common Cluster) play a prominent role in the cross-talk. (The list of co-regulated genes by I-IFN and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways was obtained from the study of Wienerroither et al. (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).

Of note, the special sequence requirement for ISGF3 does not necessarily imply that these sequences are bound more efficiently by IRF9 than other IRFs. Notably, we found that 5&#x02032;-GAAANNGAAA<underline>CT</underline>-3&#x02032; (fourth on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), but not GGAAANNGAAA (first plot on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) or <underline>WBV</underline>NGAAANNGAAA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>), were enriched in the IRF9-dominant cluster. The binding regions with the entire detailed consensus for ISGF3 (5&#x02032;-<underline>WBVG</underline>GAAANNGAAA<underline>CT</underline>-3&#x02032;) were also enriched, but less than 1% (55 out of 7373) of IRF9-dominant binding regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>) contained these ISRE variants.</p><p>ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) analysis is frequently used for assessing a classification model's performance (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). We determined ROC curves, and calculated AUC (Area Under the Curve) values in pair-wise comparisons for the three IRF-dominant subsets and three IRF cistromes. The following three types of input features were used: (i) motif strength of the ISRE motif (similarity score for the ISRE PWM from HOMER database), (ii) occurrence data of selected 6-mers (<italic>n</italic> = 13), which were most frequent in the IRF5-dominant cluster and (iii) occurrence data of selected ISRE variants (<italic>n</italic> = 7), which were most frequent in the IRF3-dominant cluster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3C, D</xref>). Because AUC represents the degree or measure of separability, the higher the AUC, the better the machine learning model is at predicting the class label in pair-wise comparisons. We found that ISRE motif scores could not separate IRF3-dominant vs. IRF9-dominant clusters or IRF3 versus IRF9 cistromes (low AUC values). In contrast, ISRE motif scores could separate IRF5-dominant and IRF5 cistrome from the other clusters/cistromes (higher AUC values, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>). These data are consistent with the enrichment analyses: the frequency of ISRE is higher in the IRF3- and IRF9- dominant clusters, and IRF3 and IRF9 cistromes compared to the IRF5-dominant cluster and the IRF5 cistrome. As expected, the occurrence data of 6-mers most frequent in the IRF5-dominant cluster could not separate IRF3-dominant vs. IRF9-dominant clusters and IRF3 versus IRF9 cistromes (low AUC values). In contrast, these 6-mers could separate IRF5-dominant clusters from the other clusters (higher AUC values, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). When occurrence data of selected ISRE variants (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were used for AUC analysis for the comparison of IRF3-dominant vs. IRF5- or IRF9-dominant clusters AUC values were higher (0.69 and 0.63). The AUC value was lower (0.59) in the IRF5-dominant vs. IRF9-dominant comparison. These results mirror the differences in the frequencies of these ISRE variants (e.g. IRF3-dominant &#x0003e; IRF9-dominant &#x0003e; IRF5-dominant cluster.</p><p>Collectively, certain 6-mers and ISRE variants were distributed differently in IRF-binding clusters; therefore, these DNA sequences most likely contribute to IRF-specific binding. None of the ISRE variants occurred exclusively in IRF-specific clusters. Thus, these sequences alone could not determine specificity.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Prior to stimulation, many IRF3- and IRF9-dominant binding regions have low accessibility</title><p>Previous studies revealed that a majority of the binding of stimulus-regulated TFs occurs at pre-existing enhancer-like accessible regions (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>).

IRF3 can promote nucleosome remodelling and/or the opening of previously inaccessible genomic regions in LPS-stimulated macrophages (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Chromatin opening by ISGF3 has also recently been studied (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Au-Yeung and Horvath found that stimulation with I-IFN decreased promoter-associated histones (e.g. H2A.Z), consistent with the observed nucleosome reorganization identified at ISG promoters. To our knowledge, the ability of IRF5 to reshape the chromatin landscape has not been investigated in genome-wide studies. Because different signaling pathways activate both overlapping and unique sets of &#x02018;latent&#x02019; or &#x02018;<italic>de novo</italic>&#x02019; enhancers (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), chromatin accessibility could be an important determinant for IRF-specific enhancer selection. Therefore, we investigated the accessible chromatin regions by performing ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high- throughput sequencing (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>)) experiments in un-stimulated (UT) DCs. Based on these results, we calculated the percentages of accessible regions in the IRF cistromes and clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), and we determined the position of accessible regions relative to IRF peaks and motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>).

Notably, the finding that ATAC-negative regions were especially enriched in the IRF3- and IRF9-dominant regions suggests that the &#x02018;chromatin barrier&#x02019; contributed to IRF3- and IRF9-specific, but not to IRF5-specific, enhancer selection, by inhibiting the binding of other IRFs.

Using Random Forest, we investigated how accurately the IRF-dominance could be predicted using different sets of features. We performed pairwise comparisons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), using the cluster label (e.g. IRF3-, IRF5-, or IRF9-dominant) of each binding region as &#x02018;class label&#x02019;.

The analysis revealed that IRF-specific binding regions associated with specific gene-sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, right panel) had patterns similar to the entire cluster in most cases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, left panel) with respect to the following seven key features: ISRE, TISRE, NFKB, TRE, CRE, GAS and ATAC-signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, based on their biological significance, we selected genes, which were associated with IRF3, IRF5-&#x000a0;or IRF9-dominant peaks in their promoter regions (TSS &#x000b1; 1&#x000a0;kb; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). Using qPCR, we investigated whether they were induced most efficiently by ligands and pathways that favoured the corresponding IRFs. We found that selected antiviral cytokines, inflammatory genes, and antiviral ISGs were regulated most efficiently by pIC, CpG and IFN-&#x003b2;, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Because genes could be regulated by several enhancers and signalling pathways could activate several TFs simultaneously, the dominance of the given pathway is not necessarily mediated dominantly or exclusively by these regions and/or these IRFs. However, in many cases their contribution was certain. For example, in the case of antiviral ISGs, their TSS &#x000b1; 10 kb window contained very few other enhancers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). Collectively, our results suggest that the identified and characterized regions, which were occupied by predominantly IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;or IRF9, are important sites for signal specific transcriptional responses.</p><p>To investigate the interactions (competitions and co-operations) between IRFs or signaling pathways in our system, we performed a series of ChIP-qPCR experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). In these experiments, the DCs were stimulated with either single agonists or a combination of ligands. We found that IRF3 binding to the IRF3-dominant regions of antiviral cytokines was inhibited by all combined treatments. The IRF5 binding to the IRF5-dominant regions of inflammatory genes was increased when the pIC&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;CpG combination was used. However, in other combinations, the IRF5 binding was inhibited. Because IRF5 was activated by both TLR3 and TLR9 agonists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>), the increased IRF5 binding may be caused by cooperation between the two pathways for IRF5 activation, and not by interaction between IRF3 and IRF5. Finally, the binding of IRF9 to IRF9-dominant regions of antiviral ISGs was similar when IFN-&#x003b2; was used alone or in combination with CPG, suggesting that the TLR9 pathway cannot inhibit IRF9 activation or binding. In all other ligand combinations, IRF9 binding was inhibited. Collectively, these results suggest that competition/cooperation between IRFs (and/or other TFs) and cross-talk between signalling pathways markedly influence the binding of IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>IRF3, IRF5&#x000a0;and IRF9 play distinct but partially overlapping roles in the regulation of antiviral cytokines, inflammatory responses, and cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. The first premise for this &#x02018;division of labour&#x02019; is that IRFs differ from each other in their DNA-binding domain (DBD) and IRF-association domains (IADs), which are responsible for interactions with other TFs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The second premise is that cis-regulatory elements of IRF-regulated genes contain features that differentially affect IRF binding. Recent high-throughput studies have highlighted the features beyond primary DNA sequence motifs that modulate binding specificity (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). The same TF and external stimulus regulate overlapping but distinct sets of genes in different cell types. For example, some NF-&#x003ba;B target genes are induced to a similar extent in both macrophages and B cells, while many others are preferentially activated in one cell type or the other (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Similarly, responses induced by I-IFN are cell type-dependent (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). These cell type-specific responses are due to several phenomena, e.g. differentially expressed receptors, differences in the signalling pathways and in the repertoires of inducible enhancers (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Our study suggests that DNA motifs occupied directly by IRFs and additional features (e.g. binding of co-activated TFs and chromatin accessibility) are involved in mediating IRF-specificity. Of note, the regions within IRF-dominant clusters were diverse, and not all regions shared the &#x02018;prototypic pattern&#x02019; of features (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). The diversity of the regions and the fact that none of the features occurred exclusively in the clusters indicate that a series of features in a combinatorial fashion, rather than exclusively highly polarized DNA sequences, mediate IRF-specific binding.</p><p>In this study, we identified and compared the IRF3-, IRF5-, and IRF9-dominant regions. From the three clusters, the IRF5-dominant cluster fundamentally differed from the IRF3- and IRF9-dominant clusters. IRF5 could occupy genomic loci via three potential mechanisms: (i) binding as a homo- or heterodimer to ISREs, (ii) binding as a monomer and (iii) indirect binding. The fact that ISRE motif was enriched in the &#x02018;IRF3 and IRF5&#x02019; and Common clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>) suggests that at least a subset of IRF5 proteins binds as dimers occupying canonical ISREs. The observations that an ISRE half-site (but not ISRE) was identified by our <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery in the IRF5 cistrome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>) and the IRF5 logo from PBM study resembles a half-site logo with a single core 5&#x02032;-GAAA-3&#x02032; element (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) do not necessarily mean that IRF5 binds dominantly or exclusively as monomers. As suggested by Andrilenas et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) the shorter logo represents a true dimer site but results from an IRF5 preference to engage more strongly to one ISRE half-site. In other words, in PBMs, IRF5 binds as a dimer with an asymmetric half-site preference (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The last mechanism suggests that IRF5 does not bind DNA directly, and its binding site is determined by other TF(s). This has been shown for IRF3, which can function as a signal-specific cofactor to activate the transcription of a set of NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent genes, without binding to an ISRE (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). The contribution of indirect binding for IRF5-mediated gene regulation awaits further experimental confirmation.</p><p>We found that IRF5-dominant cluster had three characteristic features. First, most of the IRF5-dominant regions do not contain ISRE motifs. A recent study demonstrated that bases other than C at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; positions relative to the half-site (5&#x02032;-<underline>C</underline>GAAA<underline>C</underline>-3&#x02032;) could prevent IRF5 binding to the virus response elements of IFN promoters (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our analysis revealed that not only ISRE variants, which contained bases other than C at these positions (e.g.&#x000a0;GAAAN<underline>G</underline>GAAA), but all ISRE variants were underrepresented in the IRF5-dominant cluster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Second, special ISRE half-sites, such as 5&#x02032;-GAGA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GACA-3&#x02032;, were enriched in the cluster. Further studies are needed to reveal the premise and molecular mechanism by which IRF5 binds to special 6-mers and whether IRF5 proteins could bind these ISRE half-sites as monomers. Last, the high frequency of the NFKB motif in the IRF5-dominant cluster was consistent with the observation that IRF5 binding appears to rely in large part on its interactions with NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>IRF3- and IRF9-dominant regions were more similar to each other, and the IRF3 versus IRF9 dominance was less predictable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). There are several potential reasons for the lower accuracy in prediction by machine learning. Clustering itself may be inaccurate due to differences in ChIP efficiency or other reasons. Certain non-characterized features may also be required for accurate predictions. Such &#x02018;missing features&#x02019; may include the number of motifs in a given region, the distance between the different types of motifs, the occupancy values of TFs, the presence of additional motifs, or other variants of ISRE and 6-mers. A more complex analysis in the future may reveal other features that are needed for more accurate predictions. However, we uncovered patterns, which favour either IRF3-dominant or IRF9-dominant binding (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p><p>In the IRF3-dominant cluster, we found that many of the binding regions had low accessibility prior to stimulation. The presence of higher frequency NFKB, AICE (which may serve as the binding site for IRF and AP-1), TRE and CRE motifs in the cluster suggests that IRF3 requires the collaborative binding of other co-activated TFs to &#x02018;open&#x02019; the chromatin. Alternatively, tandem binding of three or four IRF3 or other IRF(s) to TISRE, which are also enriched in the cluster, may be sufficient for nucleosome removal. The IRF3-dominant binding regions are not bound by IRF9 with high affinity, most likely because NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 are not induced in the I-IFN pathway.</p><p>We found that many IRF9-dominant regions contain both ISRE and GAS motifs, without other motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Although the consensus sequence of 5&#x02032;-<underline>WBVG</underline>GAAANNGAAA<underline>CT</underline>-3&#x02032; (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and its variants were enriched in the IRF9-dominant cluster, their frequencies were low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). However, the enrichment of the GAS motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">E</xref>) suggests that the STAT1 homodimers activated by I-IFN signalling are important determinants for IRF9-dominant binding.</p><p>Collectively, this research highlights the need for integrated analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> binding data, as well as computational analysis to understand specific enhancer selection by members of IRFs or other TF families. This study contributes to our understanding of how IRF members can initiate tailored responses to viral particles, inflammatory agents, and type I interferons without activating superfluous or harmful transcriptional programs in cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq datasets have been deposited in GEO under accession number GSE125340.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1112_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="gkz1112_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Karen Uray, Ivan Uray, L&#x000e1;szl&#x000f3; Huzsvai, Szilvia Benk&#x00151;, Szil&#x000e1;rd P&#x000f3;liska and Istv&#x000e1;n Szatm&#x000e1;ri for discussions, technical supports and comments on the manuscript.
