However, computational analysis of the sequencing data still represents a bottleneck for many laboratories. Further, specific pipelines for quality control and statistical analysis of ribosome profiling data, providing high levels of both accuracy and confidence, are currently lacking. In this study, we describe automated bioinformatic and statistical diagnoses to perform robust quality control of ribosome profiling data (RiboQC), to efficiently visualize ribosome positions and to estimate ribosome speed (RiboMine) in an unbiased way. We present an R pipeline to setup and undertake the analyses that offers the user an HTML page to scan own data regarding the following aspects: periodicity, ligation and digestion of footprints; reproducibility and batch effects of replicates; drug-related artifacts; unbiased codon enrichment including variability between mRNAs, for A, P and E sites; mining of some causal or confounding factors. We expect our pipeline to allow an optimal use of the wealth of information provided by ribosome profiling experiments.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id>TU5371-1</award-id><award-id>SPP1784</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Cancer Research</named-content></funding-source><award-id>NCT3.0_2015.54</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The translation of genetic information into polypeptide sequences is a cellular process common to all kingdoms of life, involving a multitude of orchestrated interactions between mRNAs, translation factors, ribosomes and tRNAs. Translation is a highly regulated and fine-tuned process, which enables a fast response to metabolic and environmental changes and its regulation balances the pool of proteins actively translated from mRNAs (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). While mRNAs and proteins can be measured by RNA-seq and mass spectrometry, respectively, ribosome profiling allows to directly measure protein synthesis by detecting the position of ribosomes on mRNAs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As a result, Ribo-seq provides a quantitative profile of the translatome at high resolution, i.e. the set of mRNA species under active translation. More specifically, Ribo-Seq is based on the isolation and retrieval of mRNA fragments (footprints)&#x000a0;when they are protected by a ribosome, followed by deep sequencing-based identification of ribosome footprints. Adequate alignment of these footprints allows to determine the position of translating ribosomes on mRNAs at single-codon resolution (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This method has quickly been adopted by many laboratories, but at present, data analysis requires computational expertise (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and the analysis so far has used visualization methods but few dedicated statistical estimates or quality diagnostics. Bioinformatics tools like Rqc (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) centered on quality assessment of reads (data structure, contaminants, etc.) can be used to assess the quality of sequencing but are not informative on the artifacts and batch effects detected on ribosome profiling datasets (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In this study we compared the performance of RiboVIEW with other existing tools dedicated to ribosome profiling analysis, like Gwips-viz (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), RiboProfiling (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and riboSeqR (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This comparison is presented in Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and also includes tools with some quality control capabilities like RiboViz (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), mQC (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), RiboTools (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and Ribo-TISH, (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) though none of these methods provides the full array of controls and visualization that we propose.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Artifacts and batch effects in ribosome profiling experiments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Category</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Impact</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ref</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Replicate concordance</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single codon-level analysis (ORF, etc.)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drugs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leakage, ribosome run-off, biased codon occupancy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental conditions</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ligation-digestion: end base bias, ambiguous FP location, loss of periodicity</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hybridization-subtraction: bias on codon enrichment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">EDTA: loss of information from large RPFs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">RiboZero: loss of rRNA-like mRNA segments</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drop-off due to unwanted amino acid starvation, monitoring with metagene</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNAse digestion</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Organismal specificities</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Footprint loss through size selection in s.cerevisiae</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CHX leakage in <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.&#x000a0;pombe</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PCR, seq., post-treatment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sequence preference, Biased counts due to inefficient alignment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Information loss</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other batch effects</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-relevant variability for one or all estimates</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Comparison of ribosome profiling tools</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

A template workflow is provided in the Supplementary Information. In this template, the user can define the addresses of the input files and the experimental conditions. Then, a set of commands generates results including the two HTML pages Results-QC.html and Results-MINE.html where the results can be viewed. All is coded as custom R and Python scripts. As a general rule, replicates of a same condition are either integrated or all shown. In some cases, this would have been impractical; the resulting plots are then saved to the output folder and only one replicate is shown in the HTML pages.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-3"><title>Calculating periodicity</title><p>The number of footprints which align close to the start of the annotated sequence of an mRNA are counted (regardless of codon identity). Tables of this coverage, stratified by footprint length and by position in a window of 20nt 5&#x02032; of the A in AUG-codon to 20nt on the 3&#x02032; side, are generated. Those tables are used to display periodicity using a recurrence plot (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), R function recurr from R package tseriesChaos, adapted for RiboVIEW). Recurrence plot usually represents time autocorrelation in dynamical systems, while it is used here to represent spatial autocorrelation. The recurrence plot is generated for each footprint length, alongside with a barplot, which shows the coverage achieved for each footprint length.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-4"><title>Selecting adequate footprint lengths</title><p>Recurrence plots per footprint length are displayed one at a time (function selectFPlen), after which an interactive dialog prompts the user to select a minimum and maximum footprint length which comply with recurrence every 3nt, starting at&#x000a0;&#x02212;12nt.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-5"><title>Metagene</title><p>A metagene is generated using the coverage in A site for each available position along each mRNA in one sample, which is calculated in enrichment.py and stored in output files *.metagene. Positions are normalized to the following metagene coordinates: [&#x02212;1; 0] for the 5&#x02032; UTR, [0; 1] for the CDS and [1; 2] for the 3&#x02032; UTR. Coverage counts are normalized so as to add up to unity, and binned at 0.1 resolution (option <italic>res1</italic> in function &#x02018;metagene.all&#x02019;). These normalized and binned values constitute the metagene profile. The percentage of reads in the UTRs relative to the CDS is calculated and informs possible selection artifact (indicative cutoffs of 1% and 10% are used). The percentage of reads in the first 15 codons stretch at CDS start, including the AUG codon, is calculated and compared to an indicative threshold of 1% for possible inflation around AUG. Leakage is examined at AUG and STOP codon. For AUG, a robust linear fit is applied to the metagene profile at and after AUG (metagene coordinates [&#x02212;0.1; +0.3]). If the slope from this fit is positive and has a significant <italic>P</italic>-value at 0.05 level (respectively, 0.1), this yields an indication of strong (respectively, mild) leakage after AUG. Similarly, leakage at STOP is calculated as the percentage of metagene coverage after the STOP codon relative to shortly before (segments [1; 1.3] and [0.9; 1] in metagene coordinates). A percentage larger than 5% (respectively, 1%) triggers strong (mild) indication of STOP leakage.</p><p>Ligation biases if any are highlighted in logoplots at the nucleotide and codon level. These plots are automated from coverage counts at nucleotide and codon level as derived from enrichment.py and from adapted scripts from the R package ggseqlogo. A significant nucleotide or codon sequence bias is here indicated not by a <italic>P</italic>-value, but by the information content, measured in bits. Cutoffs of 0.2 (or 0.4) are used to indicate possible (or strong) bias on a sequence.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-6"><title>Correlation between replicates</title><p>Counts per mRNA per replicate are displayed in an RPKM plot for each set of replicates of the same condition, along with the Spearman correlation at gene level. Additionally, stretches of 3&#x02013;100 codons are scanned for Spearman correlation higher than 0.4, or better, 0.6 between replicates. The relevant stretch, or 100 if none fulfills this criterion, is used to display a codon-level RPKM plot.</p><p>A heatmap with hierarchical clustering is produced for the full set of samples. Hierarchical clustering is compared to the actual experimental conditions and replicates using a Spearman correlation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-7"><title>Codon enrichment, relative codon enrichment and codon occupancy</title><p>As a rationale for unbiased codon enrichment calculation, we considered the pool of mRNA actively translated, from which footprints derived. Focusing on a codon with identity <italic>c</italic>, we look for footprints where this codon appears at a certain offset <italic>i</italic> from the A-site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). For example, this offset <italic>i</italic> could be four codons away, downstream (5&#x02032; side) of the A-site. If there is no specific pausing or acceleration of this codon <italic>c</italic> at offset <italic>i</italic>, then one would expect codon <italic>c</italic> at offset <italic>i</italic> to appear in ribosome footprints at a frequency, which simply reflects its codon usage. Based on this rationale, unbiased codon enrichment is calculated as the observed codon usage relative to the expected codon usage. In practice, in the Python script dedicated to enrichment calculation sums first the observed codon usage at mRNA level and second over mRNAs, using weights. Weight<strike>s</strike> by mRNA are defined as the number of reads per mRNA. Furthermore, we make the assumption that the expected codon usage is independent of the position, except in domains near AUG and STOP codons, which are excluded (15 codons near AUG, 5 codons near STOP codons). This yields equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref>), where in particular weights are simplified out when one sums over all mRNAs:<disp-formula id="M1"><label>(1)</label><tex-math id="M5">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Cytoplasmic extracts from these cells are then treated with RNase to digest regions of mRNAs not protected by ribosomes. 80S monosomes, that mainly protect a &#x0223c;30-nucleotide footprint, are purified using a sucrose gradient or alternatively with a sucrose cushion.

We chose Bowtie because it is fast and dedicated to short read alignments up to 50 bp, which is compatible with the length of a ribosome footprint, for which it is faster and/or more sensitive than Bowtie2 that was developed for reads longer than 50 bp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net">http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net</ext-link>).

RiboQC offers a collection of tools to scan own data for the most relevant aspects of ribosome profiling quality control.</p><sec id="SEC3-2-1"><title>Periodicity</title><p>For any given mRNA, ribosome footprint sequences should mainly correspond to the protein coding portion of the transcript, extending from the start codon to the stop codon. Footprint-allocated position of the A-site should also show a strong preference for the first nucleotide position within each codon, in agreement with the reading frame. In order to monitor these aspects, we propose both the classical coverage representation (barplot, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), which represents well the coverage obtained from different footprint lengths, and a recurrence plot, which is an unsupervised way to display recurring patterns in a series (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Recurrence plot was previously developed for dynamical systems and can be adapted in a straightforward way to ribosome profiling data. A recurrence plot is robust to non-periodic coverage variations, and preserves the positional information, whereas a Fourier transform would yield a summary value over all positions, and methods based on coverage in 0, +1 or +2 frames lose positional information and could be biased for outlier peaks. Sufficient periodicity is attained if a peak at &#x02212;12nt is present on the recurrence plot (&#x02212;12nt corresponding to AUG initiation in P-site), and distinct recurrence patterns occur every 3nt, at &#x02212;9nt, &#x02212;6nt, etc. We call &#x02018;distinct&#x02019; a recurrence black band centered around &#x02212;12, &#x02212;9, &#x02026;, &#x02212;18 nt and separated of the next band by grey to white bands. In our demonstration dataset, the peak at AUG initiation is clearly visible as a dark band at &#x02212;12nt and recurrence starting at &#x02212;12nt is shown by dark bands at &#x02212;12nt, &#x02212;9nt, &#x02026;, +18nt, each well separated by a lighter band (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> left panel). This was the case for footprints of length 27&#x02013;30nt. By contrast, footprints of length 32nt possess a diffuse peak at &#x02212;12nt (encompassing positions &#x02212;13nt and &#x02212;12nt), and lack recurrence at positions &#x02212;9, +3, +9, +12, +15, +18 nt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> right panel).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2-2"><title>Metagene</title><p>A metagene profile is an average of quantitative ribosome density of all mRNAs, along a normalized transcript. In our examples the metagene profile showed the restriction of footprints to the genes coding region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), indicating sufficient monosome selection, and absence of drop-off. Further, there were no indication of inflation around AUG or leakage either at AUG or STOP codon, as indicated by detailed zoom and diagnostic values around AUG and STOP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2-3"><title>Ligation</title><p>We assess the frequency of specific nucleotide or codon sequences at the 3&#x02032; end and 5&#x02032; end of ribosome-protected fragments likely resulting from ligase specificity, or due to PCR amplification of cDNA that may selectively amplify certain sequences, thus distorting the relative abundance of reads. To this aim, we propose a logo nucleotide and codon analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). The reduction of last a and over representation of a, c, u, further signaled by an information content larger than 0.4, suggests a bias. However, this corresponds to adapter trimming which leads to the systematic removal of a terminal a in the footprint. This distortion is seemingly not functional, since codon logo shows no bias at footprint 3&#x02032; end (this includes a-terminated codons, whose identity is recovered through the alignment), as well as no codon bias both at 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2-4"><title>Reproducibility</title><p>We assess reproducibility between replicates in several diagnostic tools, tailored for different experimental aims.

Codon-level reproducibility, important for ORF finding or local analyses, is shown in a codon-level RPKM plot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We also indicate the stretch length needed for codon-level reproducibility, corresponding to a strong Spearman correlation between replicates.

Further, a heatmap with hierarchical clustering on codon enrichment provides an objective way to assess if replicates cluster together as should be expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

For example, slower codons can be detected based on the fact that they are covered by ribosomes for longer periods of time, resulting in a higher number of reads, as ribosomal densities inversely reflect ribosomal speed (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><sec id="SEC3-3-1"><title>Bulk codon occupancy (BCO)</title><p>BCO reveals ribosome positions at single nucleotide resolution, and thus has the potential to identify translational defects affecting single codons. Ribosome dwell time at specific codons is determined as follows. The positions of the A, P and E site codons within ribosome footprints of various lengths (25&#x02013;31nt) is determined by examining the 5&#x02032; ends of footprints mapping to start codons, where initiating ribosomes are expected to contain start codons in their P sites.

If a codon is found more frequently in the ribosomal A site in comparison with the frequency of the same codon in the observable segment of the coding sequence, then there is enrichment higher than unity. The calculations aim at providing an improved estimate for ribosome acceleration or stalling. By comparison to BCO and relative codon enrichment, we applied a rigorous normalization, which yields unbiased estimates of codon stalling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Similar to BCO, a high enrichment reveals ribosome pausing or acceleration at single codons.

We demonstrated the application using data from human cells (control and cells with queuosine deficiency (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)) and in c.elegans (control and tut1 mutant worms (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)). Monitoring of quality parameters using RiboQC and exploitation of unbiased codon estimates using RiboMINE will allow users to control and explore their own data in a comprehensive and handy manner.</p><p>The analysis highlights relevant aspects revealing the quality of ribosome profiling datasets. In particular, we suggest an unsupervised way to display periodicity using recurrence plots, which has the advantage relative to other methods based on a Fourier transform to provide offset information about &#x02212;12nt for initiation in P site, and to determine if the main peaks are in the main reading frame, or offset by +1nt, +2nt. In addition, the relative codon enrichments described by Hussmann for S. Cerevisiae samples (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) as well as other artifacts should be easier to catch. Further, comparisons between several species should be facilitated, and mining might reveal additional ways to approach the data.</p><p>We also propose an unbiased estimate of codon enrichment as part of RiboVIEW. Codon enrichment provides the ratio of the observed frequency of a certain codon in comparison with its expected frequency. In contrast to traditional codon occupancy, unbiased enrichment provides direct quantification of codon-specific translation speed in each sample or across replicates. Together with mRNA footprint tracks, we expect that this improved analysis of codon pausing will open new interpretation possibilities of ribosome footprint data.</p><p>A limitation of RiboVIEW is that it focuses solely on ribosome footprints, not providing translation efficiency estimates, or ORF finding, however these aspects are covered elsewhere (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and can be easily integrated into RiboVIEW outputs. Another limitation is a focus on footprint sizes 25&#x02013;35nt, not considering shorter or longer footprints, which may be relevant in some application (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>While computational and web tools for ribosome profiling exist (a summary is provided in (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, for example Riboviz or GWIPS-viz (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), few resources focus on checking quality measures or discovering authentic new information from ribosome profiling data. RiboVIEW specifically addresses these two points. The user can further select interesting aspects for adapting data processing, or to setup further analyses. The variety of new applications dedicated to ribosome profiling and the wide array of new tools developed for data analysis and quality control calls for a rigorous testing ensuring that claimed properties are effectively attained in various experimental conditions. Thus, a benchmark approach, separated from the developing of tools, would be useful to clarify the respective qualities of the different methods.</p><p>In conclusion, RiboVIEW permits to setup and verify ribosome profiling analyses, which can be further used for integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>We used publicly available datasets GSE102315 and GSE67387.</p></sec><sec id="SEC6"><title>SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY</title><p>RiboVIEW is available as a source R package at&#x000a0;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/carinelegrand/RiboVIEW">https://github.com/carinelegrand/RiboVIEW</ext-link>&#x000a0;and as supplementary material (Supplementary_software_Riboview.zip).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1074_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz1074_supplemental_file.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Frank Lyko for his extensive support and Ann Ehrenhofer-Murray and Martin M&#x000fc;ller for constructive discussions, which seeded some aspects of this project.&#x000a0;FT was supported by the Institute of Genetics and Biophysics &#x0201c;A.
