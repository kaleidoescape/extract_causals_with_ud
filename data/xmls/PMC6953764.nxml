It is not clear whether a similar linkage can be drawn between obesity and parasitic diseases. To evaluate the effect of obesity in the immune response to cutaneous <italic>Leishmania major</italic> infection, we studied the ability of C57BL/6 mice fed a hypercaloric diet (HSB) to control leishmaniasis. Mice with diet-induced obesity presented thicker lesions with higher parasite burden and a more intense inflammatory infiltrate in the infected ear after infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. There was no difference between control and obese mice in IFN-gamma or IL-4 production by auricular draining lymph node cells, but obese mice produced higher levels of IgG1 and IL-17. Peritoneal macrophages from obese mice were less efficient to kill <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> when infected <italic>in vitro</italic> than macrophages from control mice. <italic>In vitro</italic> stimulation of macrophages with IL-17 decreased their capacity to kill the parasite. Moreover, macrophages from obese mice presented higher arginase activity. To confirm the role of IL-17 in the context of obesity and infection, we studied lesion development in obese IL-17R-/- mice infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> and found no difference in skin lesions and the leukocyte accumulation in the draining lymph node is redcuced in knockout mice compared between obese and lean animals. Our results indicate that diet-induced obesity impairs resistance to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> in C57BL/6 mice and that IL-17 is involved in lesion development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Obesity is a serious and increasing public health problem, and also induces a spectrum of metabolic disorders. Some diseases are known to be more severe in the presence of obesity. However, the interactions of obesity with the immune response to infectious agents have not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated the response of obese mice to infection with <italic>Leishmania major</italic>. C57BL/6 mice were fed a hypercaloric diet (HSB) and infected afterward with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. In obese mice, lesions were ticker and more ulcerative, and cells from draining lymph nodes produced more IL-17 when compared with cells from lean mice fed a control diet. Macrophages from obese and lean mice were infected <italic>in vitro</italic> and stimulated with IL-17 to test the role of this cytokine in effect produced by obesity. Macrophages from obese mice were more infected by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> than the macrophages from control mice and the number of parasites was increased by treatment with IL-17. IL-17R deficient mice treated with hypercaloric diet showed no difference in lesion size when compared to mice fed control diet. Our findings suggest that diet-induced obesity decrease the resistance to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection of C57BL/6 mice and the IL-17 cytokine may be involved in the lesion formation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7538-3208</contrib-id><name><surname>Maioli</surname><given-names>Tatiani Uceli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004901</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7538-3208</contrib-id><name><surname>Maioli</surname><given-names>Tatiani Uceli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007375</institution-id><institution>Pr&#x000f3;-Reitoria de Pesquisa, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7538-3208</contrib-id><name><surname>Maioli</surname><given-names>Tatiani Uceli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schoolarship</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CNPq) #446409/2014-6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cnpq.br/">http://cnpq.br/</ext-link>); Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa de Minas Gerais # APQ-01564-14 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fapemig.br/">http://www.fapemig.br/</ext-link>); Pr&#x000f3; Reitoria de Pesquisa da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (PRPq-UFMG) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ufmg.br/prpq/">https://www.ufmg.br/prpq/</ext-link>).

It is associated with a metabolic syndrome that includes insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and also leads to respiratory diseases, hepatic steatosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, infertility, cancer, stroke, osteoarthritis [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Metabolic syndrome and co-morbidities associated with obesity occur in an environment characterized by the presence of chronic low-grade inflammation [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The link between obesity and inflammation started in the early 1990s when researchers demonstrated that TNF-alfa expression was elevated in adipose tissue from obese individuals and it was related to insulin resistance [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since then, many studies have correlated obesity with inflammation, characterized by macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] decrease in dendritic cell (DC) and natural killer cell (NK) functions [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, obesity alters the profile of T cells in adipose tissue [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While T helper 1 (Th1) and CD8+ T-cells are increased in the adipose tissue of obese animals [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], regulatory T cells are reduced [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These alterations in immune cells may cause alterations in immune responses in obese individuals. However, it is unclear whether inflammation associated with obesity impacts in the immune response to infectious diseases.</p><p>It has been shown that obesity increases the susceptibility to infection by different agents such as influenza virus (H1N1) [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Karlsson and coworkers showed that obese mice infected with the H1N1 virus had increased inflammation, characterized by higher production of TNF-alfa and IL-6. Nevertheless, these animals had a poor memory CD8+ T-cell response and were more susceptible to infection [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Overweight and obese individuals also had a defective immune response to H1N1 viral infection [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Other studies have addressed the effect of obesity on parasite infections. There is a positive correlation between obesity and increased incidence of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, diet-induced obesity in C57BL/6 mice was protective in a model of cerebral malaria [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hypothalamic obesity in C57BL/6 mice infected with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA resulted in decreased parasitemia, but exacerbated inflammation, and increased mortality rate[<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Leptin-deficient obese mice (ob/ob mice) are also more susceptible to <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Sarn&#x000e1;glia showed that diet-induced obesity promoted susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis followed by higher production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased parasite load [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In spite of these studies on obesity and parasite infection, the interactions of obesity with leishmaniasis are still poorly understood. Resistance to <italic>Leishmania major</italic> infection is well characterized in C57BL/6 mice. Induction of an early Th1 response is necessary to induce resistance. Initial activation of dendritic cells leads to the production of IL-12 [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] that promotes a Th1 response with high levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alfa production, and low levels of IgG1 antibody secretion. The establishment of this polarized inflammatory environment activates the expression of iNOS and NO production in macrophages, which has leishmanicidal activity [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is a well-established model of resistance to infection. Therefore, we decided to investigate if obesity would interfere in the outcome of cutaneous leishmaniasis in C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>Our results showed that obesity did not affect the development of a Th1 response, nor trigger a Th2 response. However, obese mice were more susceptible to infection. Moreover, the increased IL-17 production found in obese mice in response to infection was not able to control <italic>Leishmania</italic> growth, suggesting that this cytokine could be one reason for parasite growth. Our findings with mice that lack the receptor for IL-17 (IL-17R-/-) indicate that this interleukin is important for the inflammation and control of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection C57BL/6. The increased inflammation with higher IL-17 production provides one mechanism for the increased susceptibility of obese mice to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection. Our results bring new insights into the interactions between immune response and obesity in animals facing a parasite infection with possible implications for the clinical outcome of leishmaniasis during obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals and diet-induced obesity</title><p>All experiments were performed using six-eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice, weighting approximately 18g, and obtained from the Animal Facility at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (CEBIO, UFMG&#x02014;Belo Horizonte, Brazil).

Our results showed that C57BL/6 mice with diet-induced obesity present larger lesions than control lean mice, and these lesions contained more parasites. We observed no difference in IFN-gamma, IL-4 and TNF-alfa production by cells from the auricular draining lymph nodes of these mice, but there was an increase in the levels of IL-17. Moreover, peritoneal macrophages from obese mice were less efficient in killing amastigotes than macrophages from control mice, and addition of IL-17 to macrophage cultures decreased their ability to control infection compared with ones stimulated with IFN-gamma. To further clarify the role of IL-17 in this process, we fed IL-17 receptor-deficient C57BL/6 mice with either hypercaloric HBS or control AIN93G diet, and infected them with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. Interestingly, obese IL-17R-/- did not have augmented lesions, but presented high parasite load, and no difference in infection was observed between HBS fed or AIN93G fed mice.</p><p>There is a gap in understanding how obesity affects the course of intracellular infections, including parasite infections. In accordance with the negative association between obesity and infectious diseases already described [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], our study showed that obese mice had higher parasite burden than lean mice, failing to control parasite growth. In addition, lesions in obese mice were larger and more ulcerative than the lesion in the control group. Adipose tissue produces cytokines, adipokines, and chemokines which alter the immune response, affecting the recruitment of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is known that obesity also affects T cell differentiation and function, increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Considering that obesity is associated with a &#x0201c;low-grade&#x0201d; inflammation, one reasonable hypothesis could be that in the specific case of cutaneous leishmaniasis, where macrophages require an inflammatory environment to control parasites, obesity would improve the immune response against <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. However, our data do not support this hypothesis. The histological data also detected a higher parasite burden in obese C57BL/6 mice when compared to mice from the control group further indicating that obesity interferes with control of parasite growth. Interestingly, lesions in obese mice showed increased cellular infiltration; however, the inflammatory cells had poor ability to eliminate the parasites.</p><p>We also measured the antibody response to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> in sera and found higher levels of IgG and IgG1 in obese C57BL/6 mice than control mice after eight weeks of infection. As described in previous studies, susceptibility to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection is associated with isotype switching to IgG1 [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Antibody levels are directly related to parasite number, as antibodies may form immune complexes that bind to Fc&#x003b3; receptors (Fc&#x003b3;R), inhibiting the proinflammatory activity of macrophages, without impairing phagocytosis [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, despite favoring phagocytosis, IgG fails to protect against <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>, and even worse, contributes to the pathogenicity itself [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Indeed, it has been reported that phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized amastigote forms induces the activation of signaling pathways leading to the production of IL-10 by macrophages [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>To understand why obese C57BL/6 mice had more severe lesions than control mice, we also evaluated cytokine production. Obesity did not affect the production of IL-4 in C57BL/6 mice. This result differs from previous data that associate obesity with susceptibility to asthma and allergies, driven by higher IL-4 secretion and Th2 differentiation [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We also showed no difference in TNF-alfa and IFN-gamma levels at the time points measured. Obese mice did not show overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines by cells from the draining lymph nodes. In response to parasite antigens, it was expected a higher production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by obese mice, as it was observed for infection with <italic>Plasmodiun berguei</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and also for infection with <italic>Leishmania chagasi</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The role of IL-17 in leishmaniasis has been a subject of debate. We found a higher IL-17 production by lymph node cells of obese mice, which presented a more severe lesion with higher parasite burden than the control group. Classically, IL-17 production is associated with neutrophil recruitment and often is related to pro-inflammatory response in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], fungal [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and bacterial infections [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, recent studies have questioned whether IL-17 function is restricted to pro-inflammatory action [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. IL-17 is produced mainly by Th17 cells, which could be stimulated by a different combination of cytokines, including TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-23 and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Obesity alters the cytokine profile in adipose tissue and in serum, and IL-17 seems to have a significant role in obesity. Previous studies have shown that production of this cytokine is elevated in obesity, both in humans and mice [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In line with these reports, our results showed that cells from draining lymph nodes from infected obese mice secrete higher levels of IL-17. Studies on cutaneous leishmaniasis have correlated IL-17 release with increased pathogenicity in cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Results obtained using mice IL-17R-/- showed that these mice had less severe lesions then wild type mice with lower numbers of leukocytes in the draining lymph nodes; however the parasite burden was as high as in obese WT mice, with no difference between HBS fed or AIN93 fed mice. Therefore, IL-17 seems to play a critical role in lesion and ulcer formation in obese mice during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection.</p><p>We also performed <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of macrophages with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> to assess the efficiency of macrophages from obese C57BL/6 mice to kill the parasites. There was an increased frequency of infected cells among macrophages from obese mice 4 hours post infection, and a larger number of amastigotes/cell in macrophages from obese mice 4 and 72 hours post infection. These results are in line with higher arginase activity detected in macrophages from obese mice. Interestingly, Sousa and coworkers found that IL-17 increases arginase activity, and favor parasite growth in BALB/c mice infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Arginase activity is increased in mice susceptible to cutaneous leishmaniasis, and this enzyme utilizes arginine as a substrate to induce polyamine production instead of NO [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Interestingly, studies on inflammatory bowel disease have demonstrated that IL-17 induces an alternative activated macrophages response. Moreover, IL-17KO C57BL/6 mice expressed lower levels of mRNA coding for molecules associated with alternative activated macrophages activity, including arginase 1 [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Another study showed that IL-17 induces arginase 1 production in a model of human Papillomavirus [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In this case, arginase 1 would be active in the macrophages in our experiments. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results showed an environment where IFN-gamma would still be inducing the parasite control in obese macrophages. However, IL-17 production decrease, even a little, the leishmanicidal activity of macrophages from obese mice and could further facilitated parasite growth by increasing arginase activity.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that IL-17 would impair leishmania killing by macrophages, we infected macrophages stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> with IL-17. IL-17 interfered with parasite elimination by macrophages from control and obese mice. Moreover, addition of this cytokine decreased parasite killing by control macrophages activated with IFN-gamma.</p><p>To further confirm our hypothesis, we performed an experiment with IL-17 receptor deficient mice. These mice did not show weight gain when fed HSB diet and no difference was observed between lean and obese mice infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. It was reported before that IL-17R-/- mice did not gain weight when fed a high fat diet because they developed an inflammatory reaction in the small intestine that allowed bacterial translocation [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>It was already observed that IL-17-deficient BALB/c mice developed smaller lesions despite only a modest reduction in parasite loads [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] when infected with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>, the same profile we observed in obese IL-17R-/- mice that controlled lesion sizes but not parasite burdens. It is not in the literature that the wound induced by <italic>Leishmania ssp</italic>. is not always related with parasite burden [<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006596.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, we propose IL-17 as an alternative cytokine that may determine the fate of the lesion formation in response to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> in mice that received hypercaloric diet. We showed that diet-induced obesity, a condition associated with IL-17 production, increased the susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice, a mouse strain genetically resistant to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection. Therefore, IL-17 could be a potential candidate to explain diverse comorbidities associated with obesity and its role in models of infection and ulcerated wound.</p><p>Taken together, our results showed that diet-induced obesity in C57BL/6 mice decreased their capacity to control infection by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. This might be related to the induction of IgG1 secretion, IL-17 production and impaired capacity of macrophages to control parasite growth. The present results provide novel clues about the relationship between obesity and leishmanial infection in a time when infection is now being added to the list of health risks associated with obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006596.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Metabolic evaluation in mice fed HSB diet before and after <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection.</title><p>(A) Fasting glycaemia.
