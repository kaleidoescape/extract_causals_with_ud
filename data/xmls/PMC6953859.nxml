For example, CNTs have high stiffness with a Young&#x02019;s modulus of approx. 1 TPa [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225589.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which makes them suitable for applications such as structural materials for cars and space ships. The toughness of CNTs has attracted interest in the field of orthopedics for their use as biomaterials for bone regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potentials to self-renew and differentiate into the multilineage phenotypes derived from mesoderm, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225589.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During osteogenic differentiation, MSCs differentiate into pre-osteoblasts, which become mature osteoblast and later on osteocytes [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, MSCs has been originally isolated from the bone marrow, but it was reported over the last decades that they can be isolated from the adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood, placenta, dental pulp, and many other adult tissues, and thus are an attractive cell source for tissue engineering that supports autologous cell-based therapies in the field of regenerative medicine [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225589.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Strategies to control proliferation and differentiation of MSCs and direct their fate are present challenges in tissue engineering. In recent years, some biophysical factors such as material stiffness as well as biochemical factors that can affect MSC behaviors (proliferation, differentiation and migration) have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Understanding their factors and the extracellular environment that provides them is essential to create new technologies that control the growth and differentiation of MSCs.</p><p>CNTs have a cylindrical nanostructure consisting of carbon atoms, and are classified as single-walled (SWNT) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT). While CNTs have excellent mechanical properties, their low dispersity in water derived from their hydrophobic character gives rise to intractable disadvantages. Although detergents and alcohols are generally applied to disperse CNTs, the density limitation for the dispersion is not very high [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To get high dispersity, CNTs conjugated with hydrophilic functional groups and molecules have been developed [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However the water dispersed CNTs are cytotoxic to human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0225589.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the surface with densely immobilized CNTs also reported to be less biocompatible [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The functionalized CNTs immobilized on a base material may exfoliate and resuspend in the medium.</p><p>4-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-&#x003b1;-d-glucuronoxylan (GX) solution is a remarkable dispersant of CNTs and enables us to disperse them at high concentration without chemical modification [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The dispersion method using GX is a very attractive for high-density intact CNT coating and film preparation. In the following, we describe the preparation of glass densely coated with intact CNTs using GX solution and their application as substrates to stimulate MSC incubated on these surfaces. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of a surface coating with high-density CNTs on cell adhesion and the osteogenic differentiation of rat MSCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Preparation of CNT-coated glass</title><p>Single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) were provided by Unidym (Sunnyvale, CA) and multi-walled CNTs (MWNTs) were provided by Nitta (Osaka, Japan). SWNTs and MWNTs were dispersed in 0.2% (w/v) GX solution (IPE Inc., Sakai, Japan) at 0.4 mg/ml. CNT-dispersed solutions (100 &#x003bc;l) were dropped and dried onto 12-mm glass disks (Matsunami, Kishiwada, Japan). After washing in distilled water a few times, the CNT-coated glass disks were dried and sterilized at 180&#x000b0;C. When glass disks are employed as cell culture substrates, poly-l-ornithine (PLO; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) coating is often used to promote cell adhesion to the glass surface [<xref rid="pone.0225589.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

After reaching confluence, MSCs were trypsinized using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin/EDTA solution (Nacalai Tesque), and a cell suspension was prepared to achieve a cellular concentration of 50,000 cells/ml.
