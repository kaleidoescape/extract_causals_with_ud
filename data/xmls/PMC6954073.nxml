Although previous research using two-dimensional gel-based proteomics to assess the proteins related to the rice blast resistance <italic>had been done</italic>, few proteins were identified. Here, we used the iTRAQ method to detect the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the durable resistant rice variety Gangyuan8 (GY8) and the susceptible rice variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) in response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryza</italic>e invasion, and then transcriptome sequencing was used to assist analysis A total of 193 and 672 DEPs were specifically identified in GY8 and LTH, respectively, with only 46 similarly expressed DEPs being shared by GY8 and LTH.39 DEPs involved in plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, fatty acid metabolism and peroxisome biosynthesis were significantly different between compatible interaction (LTH) and incompatible interaction (GY8). Some proteins participated in peroxide signal transduction and biosynthesis was down-regulated in GY8 but up-regulated in LTH. A lot of genes encoding pathogenesis-related gene (PR), such as chitinase and glucanase, were significantly up-regulated at both the transcriptome and proteome levels at 24 hours post-inoculation in GY8, but up-regulated at the transcriptome level and down-regulated at the proteome level in LTH. Our study reveals that the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity defense system may be activated at the transcriptome level but was inhibited at the protein level in susceptible rice varieties after inoculation. The results may facilitate future studies of the molecular mechanisms of rice blast resistance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571993</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8692-7090</contrib-id><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Wenjing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31772107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8692-7090</contrib-id><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Wenjing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31772107 and 31571993)</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="20"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All the MS raw data are available from the ProteomeXchange database and iProX database (ProteomeXchange ID: PXD016645, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016645">http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016645</ext-link>; iProX ID: IPX0001903001).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All the MS raw data are available from the ProteomeXchange database and iProX database (ProteomeXchange ID: PXD016645, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016645">http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD016645</ext-link>; iProX ID: IPX0001903001).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice blast, caused by <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> L., is the most destructive disease in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and reduces global yields annually by 10%&#x02013;15% [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227470.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].Knowledge on the broad-spectrum resistance mechanism to rice blast is of great significance for the disease resistance breeding and diseases control.</p><p>To combat <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, rice has formed two immune system, named pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227470.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PTI was considered the first line of defense and conferd durable and broad-spectrum resistance. In this system, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize PAMPs which are widely conserved in pathogens trigger a weakly immune response [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Plant PRRs contained transmembrane receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and receptor-like proteins (RLPs). Previous identified PAMPs included flagellin, peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and chitin [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ETI, as the second layer of the plant innate immune, is initiated by archetypical resistance (R) proteins that directly or indirectly recognize effectors secreted into the plant cells by the pathogen. Unlike PAMPs, effectors are highly variable, and the disease resistance mediated by ETI is generally race-specific [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Although PTI and ETI use different receptors, they share similar molecular processes, and both ETI and PTI can activate the expression of downstream response proteins. Between compatible and incompatible interactions, the expression profile of response proteins differs significantly [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Proteomic studies on the expression patterns and regulatory networks of these proteins are important for understanding the mechanisms of plant resistance.</p><p>Previous proteomics-based profiling studies on the rice response to rice blast fungus and elicitors have been performed using two-dimensional gel (2-DE) [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These studies identified diverse proteins responsive to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, and some elicitors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) responses and the cellular protection of ROS production, NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase B lactoylglutathione lyase and uridine ribohydrolase 1 [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], receptor-like protein kinases (RLK), glucanases, peroxidase (POX 22.3), probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1), and rice pathogenesis-related proteins (PR), were induced or increased in the inoculated leaf [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although 2-DE is able to separate thousands of different proteins and provide visual information relating to the proteome, including under blast fungus invasion, it is not suitable for the detection of low-abundance proteins or high-accuracy quantification [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, many low-abundance differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) associated with blast resistance remain to be explored.</p><p>iTRAQ is a mass spectrometry-based quantitative approach that has become prevalent in rice proteomics [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

When attacked by pathogens, receptor genes and MAPK cascade genes in rice cells are activated rapidly [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Many previous studies have confirmed that the expression of disease-resistant proteins and disease-resistant genes was up-regulated in both disease-resistant and susceptible varieties, but the up-regulated expression was earlier and higher in disease-resistant varieties [<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227470.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

More specifically, many disease-resistant proteins were highly expressed in the susceptible variety before inoculation, but were inhibited after inoculation, while the basic expression of such proteins in the resistant variety was not high, but the expression was significantly up-regulated after induction by pathogens. Thus, in researching disease-resistance mechanisms, we should not only focus on the proteins that induce up-regulated expression but also on the proteins that are down-regulated in the susceptible varieties but maintain the same expression level in the resistant varieties.
