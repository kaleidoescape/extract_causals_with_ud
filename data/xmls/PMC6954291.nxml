Recently, it has been found to target UbcH5s by covalently bonding with Cys85 specifically, but the exact molecular basis remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the structural specificity of the catalytic site of UbcH5s by comparing them with other E2 proteins. Molecular dynamics was performed to detect the structural stability of the catalytic site. Docking method was then used to predict conformations of ligand docked at the catalytic site of UbcH5s. The electrostatic surface and charge distribution of ligand and proteins were analyzed by quantitative calculation. Molecular dynamics was used to detect the stability of docking complexes of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone and UbcH5s, the covalently bonded intermediates and the products. The QM/MM methodology was used to calculate the free energy barrier of hydrogen transfer and formation of covalent bond between 15-position carbon of ligand and Cys85. Results revealed that the structure of the catalytic site is stable, and 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone can dock at the catalytic site with correct conformation. Molecular dynamics further demonstrates that 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone can steadily combine with UbcH5s. Intermediate and product of catalytic reaction are also certified to be stable. Besides, Asp112 and Asn114 function as anchors to fix ligand, ensuring it steadily docked at catalytic site to complete covalent reaction. More importantly, we have found that Cys85 of UbcH5c is more efficient to form a covalent bond with the ligand in comparison with UbcH5a and UbcH5b. Our results successfully explained the mechanism of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone covalently bonding with UbcH5s. Such molecular mechanism may provide a better insight into the molecular development or modification for ubiquitin-related drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biochemistry</kwd><kwd>Computational biology and bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Molecular biology</kwd><kwd>Structural biology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Recent studies have indicated that medicinal herbs have been gradually widely used despite insufficient information correlating with their mechanism of action. At present, research institutions or companies are devoting themselves to discovery a class of bioactive compounds, their valuable target proteins and mechanisms of action against diseases. Sesquiterpene lactones are plant-derived bioactive constituents, which have subjected numerous studies. Researches revealed that they could be used in medicines against inflammation, cancer, malaria, and viral and bacterial infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Pharmacodynamic studies further reported that sesquiterpene lactones might exert therapeutic effects by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathway activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of sesquiterpene lactones targeting protein on NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathway is unknown.</p><p id="Par3">1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone that belonged to sesquiterpene lactone has been found to possess anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. From the data of its discovery, studies reported almost the same pharmacological effects of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone and its derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, of which they can covalently bond with Cys38 of p65, further influencing NF-&#x003ba;B signal pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, these results failed to explain whether 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone has specific selectivity for Cys38, nor can it explain the mechanism of action between the ligand and the protein. Recently, Zhenlin Hu and Weidong Zhang team&#x02019;s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> found that 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone can specifically establish covalent bonds with Cys85 of Ubiquitin-conjugating Enzyme H5 (UbcH5), preventing catalytic reaction and inhibiting effectively activation of TNF-&#x003b1;/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (the pathway is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although preliminary docking simulation in their research has been performed, the exact molecular basis remains unclear. To modify the structure of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone and better develop this leading compound against UbcH5 in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, the specific mechanism of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone interacting with UbcH5s is needed to explore in-depth.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The cell signal pathway of TNF-&#x003b1;/NF-&#x003ba;B.

Then UbcH5s carrying Ub will mark NF-&#x003ba;B essential modulator (NEMO) with multi-step. IKKs phosphorylates the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor I&#x003ba;B and induce proteasomal degradation.

UbcH5s belonged to E2 enzymes are involved in TNF-&#x003b1;/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, consisting of three homologs&#x02012;UbcH5a, UbcH5b, and UbcH5c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

These simulations can capture a wide variety of important biomolecular processes, including conformational change, ligand binding, and protein folding. Importantly, such simulations can also predict how biomolecules will respond&#x02014;at an atomic level&#x02014;to perturbations such as mutation, phosphorylation, protonation, or the addition or removal of a ligand. MD simulations are often used in combination with experimental structural biology techniques, including X-ray crystallography, cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). During MD simulations, a variety of properties, such as the flexibility of ligand or residues, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic property, can be analyzed through successive trajectories of molecular dynamics. According to these properties, explaining the mechanisms of ligand-protein interactions becomes possible. Up to now, this approach is widely applied in biomolecules and drug discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, the limitation for this force-field based simulations is the chemical reactivity, such as bond break or formation, which cannot be simulated during MD. To solve this problem, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods have been developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. QM/MM methods combine a quantum mechanical treatment of the subset of atoms involved in the chemical reaction with a molecular mechanics description of the surroundings. Partitioning the system is based on the idea that the apparent redistribution of the electron is often limited to a small subset of the atoms, while the effects of the majority atoms in the system can be described adequately by a classical treatment of intermolecular interactions. Therefore, QM calculation with higher accuracy is applied to treat the formation of a covalent bond at the catalytic site, and a classical (MM) treatment is used for the surroundings in this research.</p><p id="Par6">In this research, we utilized MD simulations and QM/MM calculations to describe comprehensively the reaction process of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone catalyzed by UbcH5s. Here, Cys85 is a conservative catalytic site and activated when thiol hydrogen transfers to Asp117. The activated Cys85 will undergo a nucleophilic attack on the carbon atom of &#x003b1;-methylene of the ligand and form a covalent bond with it. Asn114 and Asp112 are found to form stable hydrogen bonds with substrate to guarantee it combining firmly with protein at the active site. Besides, Cys85 of UbcH5c is more efficient to be activated and form a covalent bond with the ligand in comparison with UbcH5a and UbcH5b. 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone might be more selective for UbcH5c. In this research, we explain the reaction mechanism of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone interacting with UbcH5s for the first time, hoping the information that could assist the modification of molecule and drug development against inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sequence alignment and structure superposition analysis</title><p id="Par7">Human UbcH5s (UbcH5a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, UbcH5b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and UbcH5c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>) sequence alignment and structural superposition were performed using CLUSTALW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, ESPript 3.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and PyMol 1.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,B</xref>).

TNF-&#x003b1;/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway has been reported to correlate with inflammatory diseases. UbcH5s are supported to play a pivotal role in TNF-&#x003b1;-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation by growing evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone since discovered is rarely reported about its pharmacological action, and only a few of literature indicated that it has anti-inflammatory effects. Apart from this, there is not a description in detail about its pharmacological mechanism. Although 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone is discovered to form a covalent bond with UbcH5s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> effectively blocking the TNF-&#x003b1;/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, molecular mechanism about it combined with UbcH5s was just preliminarily explored by docking method. In this research, we first elaborate how 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone is covalently bonded to UbcH5s through hybrid methods including docking, MD simulations, and QM/MM calculations, which can provide the interaction mechanisms at the molecular level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Previous researches reported that Cys85 is the E2 active site residue, and it is able to form thiol bond with Ub from E1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, this residue participates in transducing the structural changes at the E3-binding site to the active site of UbcH5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Consistent with these findings, 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone has been proved to covalently bond with cys85 of UbcH5s effectively suppressed protein activation. Therefore, we focused our attention on this residue in order to find out the mechanism of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone, specifically interacting with UbcH5s. In UbcH5s family, the sequences of UbcH5a/b/c are highly similar, and the 3D structure of these proteins almost coincide with each other. Therefore, we can assume that these proteins could perform similarity in behavior of catalysis. However, compared with other proteins such as Ubc1, Ubc7, UbcH7, UbcH8, Ube2b, Ube2j2, Ube2s, Ube2w, CDC34 and so forth, not only are there differences in sequences, but the protein structures are also vastly different. During analyzing the residues around Cys85 of UbcH5s, we found that Asp117 can form catalytic diad with Cys85. However, no Asp corresponding to Asp117 of UbcH5s is not detected in these proteins, in other word there is not Asp assisting Cys to complete catalytic reaction. This difference might be one of the reasons that 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone can specifically target UbcH5s.</p><p id="Par26">Because there are no obvious pocket areas on the protein surface for ligands docking, the binding poses to proteins are particularly important. Direct covalent docking experiment without judgment will make an unreasonable conformation. The research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> confirmed that 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone can covalently modify the active site cysteine (Cys85) of UbcH5s. Therefore the ligand that could dock toward for Cys85 with correct conformation or not will determine the success or failure of the simulation experiment. We successfully obtained the pose of 15-position carbon of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone docked to Cys85 with proper orientation and distance. Moreover, the subsequent electrostatic surface analysis and energy decomposition further demonstrate the electrostatic interaction between sulfur atoms and carbon atoms. Such noncovalent interactions might serve as an initial site-recognition step when the ligand binds with UbcH5s. Then the probability of the covalent reaction and stability of the covalent adduct between ligand and Cys85 of UbcH5 should be raised.</p><p id="Par27">Although molecular docking method successfully generated the suitable pose of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone interacting with UbcH5s, the conformation obtained by molecular docking is only a static result. Whether the structure can stably bind to the catalytic site over time requires further confirmation by molecular dynamics. In order to guarantee the scientific rationality of the simulation, we pay more attention to the stability of structures, residues and distances. In UbcH5s, a stable hydrogen-bond distance between the thiol of Cys85 and the carboxyl oxygen of Asp117 is beneficial to the deprotonation of Cys85 and activated Cys85 can attack the substrate nucleophilically. Therefore, we need to first evaluate the stability of the hydrogen bond distance between these two residues at the beginning of the entire simulation. Subsequently, activated Cys85 forms a covalent bond with the 15-position olefin carbon of the ligand, and the negatively charged ligand as an intermediate should form a hydrogen bond with Asp117 by 14-position oxygen atom. This hydrogen bond not only strengthens the intermediate but also to equilibrate the charge. Only stable intermediates can ensure the smooth progress of the catalysis, and it is also able to prove the correctness of our speculative reaction mechanism. When the catalytic process is completed, the 14-position carbonyl oxygen should be converted to a hydroxyl group and remains hydrogen bonding with Asp117, which can facilitate the stability of the covalently bound ligand at the catalytic site. In addition, Asp112 and Asn114 are found to form hydrogen bonds with 13-position epoxy and 16-position hydroxyl. These two hydrogen bonds are stable throughout the molecular dynamics. Since there are no obvious pockets or recessed areas on the surface of UbcH5s, hydrogen bonding plays a particularly important role in the process of ligand binding protein, and these hydrogen bonds are beneficial to fix ligand in the process of Michael addition. Molecular dynamics help us to confirm our assumption about the catalytic reaction mechanism further and dynamically describe the catalytic process in comparison with the direct covalently docking method.</p><p id="Par28">Since molecular dynamics can only simulate the trajectories of atoms but not bond break or formation, therefore this problem is needed to be explored by quantum chemistry. The issue we are concerned about is whether the sulfur atom of Cys85 and the 15-position olefin carbon of ligand can form a covalent bond at such stable distances from 3.45 to 3.80&#x02009;&#x000c5;. According to calculated results, the free energy barriers for the covalent attachment of Cys85 to the substrate are respectively 83.22, 79.55 and 73.86&#x02009;kJ/mol. In comparison with UbcH5a and UbcH5b, UbcH5c with lower free energy barrier can effectively form the covalent bond. The energy barriers of the carboxyl hydrogen of Asp117 transferring to the 14-position carbonyl oxygen of ligand are 30.21, 29.20 and 27.50&#x02009;kJ/mol respectively. Compared with UbcH5a and UbcH5b, the hydrogen of UbcH5c with lower free energy barrier transfers from Asp117 to 14-position carbonyl oxygen. According to the above analysis, the order of activation efficiency and effectiveness of covalent reaction can be sorted as UbcH5c&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;UbcH5b&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;UbcH5a. Cys85 of UbcH5c is more efficient to be activated and form a covalent bond with the ligand. The result is consistent with Zhenlin Hu and Weidong Zhang team&#x02019;s research which has reported selectivity of among UbcH5a, UbcH5b, and UbcH5c with apparent dissociation constants (KD) of 5.189&#x02009;mM, 3.578&#x02009;mM, and 2.577&#x02009;mM, respectively. Therefore, we infer that 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone is more selective for UbcH5c.</p><p id="Par29">In summary, we provide an interpretation for the mechanism of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone covalently bonds with UbcH5s. During this research, several residues including Asp112, Asn114 and Asp117, are particularly important, not only assisting in fixing ligand but also ensuring completion of the catalytic reaction. We confirmed that the molecular geometry of 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone and the chemical environment around the target thiol group is the essential factors determining the reactive selectivity of ligand toward Cys85 of UbcH5s. 1&#x003b2;-hydroxy alantolactone represents the basis for a potential new class of therapeutics for anti-TNF-&#x003b1; interventions.
