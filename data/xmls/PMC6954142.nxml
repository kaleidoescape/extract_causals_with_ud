Therefore, to predict positional changes of the target and indicators based on MRI and US, it is essential to confirm the mammary gland distribution, lateral border line, and boundary surface between lobes.</p><p id="Par15">When the body is in the supine position, the major pectoral muscle side of the breast, more so than the skin side, is displaced along the curve of the chest wall to the outside. This is because the fixation of the adipose layer of the retro-mammary space and breast (LAFS: lubricant adipofascial system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) is extremely loose compared with the fixation of the breast and the skin by Cooper&#x02019;s ligaments. Because the degree of displacement does not correlate with the composition and size of the breast, it is necessary to confirm the mammary gland distribution and lateral border line as a whole image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Image for understanding fat and mammary gland distribution in breast image. i The fibroglandular zone is distributed to the periphery.

Confirming whether the target and/or indicators are in the front or back lobe of the breast is important for predicting their positional changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the boundary surface between the front and back lobes (lobular interface). In MRI, the lobular interface can be confirmed from high-resolution transverse images and visualized as a continuous linear structure running from below the nipple to the outside. In US, at the time of sweep observation, the interface is detected as a boundary surface that differs from the &#x0201c;TDLU-duct-surrounding stroma pattern&#x0201d;; it is occasionally confirmed as a partial sheet-like hyperechoic image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In cases where it is difficult to confirm the interface, it can be detected as a lateral deviation of approximately 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;mm by changing the angle of pressure applied with the probe. Because lateral deviation is easier to recognize in breast sites with more fibrous components and stroma matrix components, in most breasts, it is easier to identify the lobular interface beneath the nipple and in the upper lateral area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Identification of targets by second-look US</title><p id="Par17">A Canon Ultrasound Diagnostic System Aplio500 (Tochigi, Japan) attached to a probe (PLT-1204BX; center frequency 14&#x000a0;MHz) was used for all US examinations.

Moreover, because body position differs between examinations, it can be difficult to accurately match lesions depicted by MRI with second-look US findings.</p><p id="Par36">In reports where second-look US was performed with reference to the location, shape, and size of MRI-determined lesions, the identification rates are typically quite low at 23&#x02013;71% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Candelaria et al. have performed second-look US with reference to MRI findings using the distance of the lesion from the nipple and its depth. However, because these values are greatly affected by posture, the identification rate was only 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, in a Korean study, Hong et al. have reported a high identification rate of 86.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The authors suggested that their superior identification rate is attributable to the better suitability of smaller breasted Asian women for US exams or recent advances in US devices. In addition to the conventional identification method, Hong et al. have noted that they used subcutaneous fat, glandular tissue, and subglandular fat as breast landmarks in second-look US, which could have contributed to their superior identification rate.</p><p id="Par37">In the present study, we added the positional relationship of targets with the surrounding vascular routes as a new landmark and achieved an identification rate of 99% in Asian women. This identification rate is higher than that reported by Hong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] for a similar population. Of note, approximately 15% of breast lesions were identified using vascular routes as landmarks, regardless of MRI findings. The use of vascular routes enabled the identification of lesions even in breasts where the characteristic adipose tissue, mammary gland distribution, and Cooper&#x02019;s ligaments could not be detected. Therefore, this method contributed to our extremely high identification rate.</p><p id="Par38">In the published literature, the mean size of lesions on MRI was 8.5&#x02013;10.1&#x000a0;mm for masses and 22&#x02013;32.6&#x000a0;mm for non-masses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our study, the mean sizes were 8.0&#x000a0;mm for mass lesions and 17.8&#x000a0;mm for non-mass lesions, indicating that we were able to detect smaller lesions. Furthermore, we achieved an extremely high identification rate even for focal lesions &#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;mm. In previous reports, when stratifying lesions based on MRI findings, mass lesions often have a higher identification rate than non-mass lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our study, the identification rate was high irrespective of MRI findings, indicating that using the surrounding anatomical structures as indicators can enable reliable identification of even slightly pale lesions that do not exhibit malignant properties on US. In summary, these results highlight the importance of considering anatomical breast structures, including vascular routes, surrounding the target when performing second-look US examinations for MRI-detected breast abnormalities.</p><p id="Par39">The method used for pathological diagnosis is also important. In reports to date, lesions found by second-look US have been diagnosed by CNB, VAB, and even open biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">We performed FNAC diagnosis of all lesions identified as targets in this study. Thereafter, we compared our FNAC results with those generated by the analysis of 10,890 cases at 12 facilities compiled by the Japan Society of Clinical Cytology Working Group (WGJSCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">It is impossible to compare the sensitivity in detail, because the WGJSCC did not study lesions with a US diameter&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;cm. Regarding false negatives, the WGJSCC study reported a rate of 15.5% (46/297) for tumors or hypoechoic lesions with a US diameter&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;cm. Our false-negative rate of 15.4% (8/52) was similar for lesions with a US diameter&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;cm (5.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.0&#x000a0;mm). All ten false-negative cases in our study were low-malignancy DCIS, and there were no invasive carcinoma false negatives. Moreover, we reviewed three false-positive cases. The histopathological results showed mastopathy-type fibroadenoma, mastopathy accompanied by apocrine metaplasia, and various findings of mastopathy, consistent with the WGJSCC report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">In previous post-MRI second-look US studies, 70&#x02013;80% of the lesions examined were found to be benign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and in some cases, the targets were plural sites. FNAC is superior to CNB for puncture of lesions proximal to the skin and nipple, lesions at thin mammary gland sites (particularly on the internal side in small-breasted East Asian women), lesions proximal to thick blood vessels, and lesions in breasts with high-density fibrous components in MMG. In addition, FNAC is safe for patients undergoing oral anticoagulant therapy and for puncturing most lesions. Furthermore, FNAC allows faster diagnosis and is an economical inspection method.</p><p id="Par43">Taken together, our findings support that FNAC is useful as an initial pathological diagnostic tool, even in cases of post-MRI second-look US. The finding that lesions difficult to diagnose by FNAC tend to be lobular carcinomas, sclerosing adenosis, low-malignancy DCIS, or mastopathy-type fibroadenomas should be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, by carefully considering the image findings, it is crucial to decide whether CNB or surgical resection is required or if the case should simply be observed.</p><p id="Par44">Finally, the limitations of this study must be noted. First, this was a retrospective study and was thus biased in that all decisions, such as whether or not to perform second-look US, were made by the physician. Second, although excellent results were obtained when FNAC was combined with post-MRI second-look US using the new anatomical landmark as the indicator, enabling this technique at other institutions would not be simple because it is necessary to develop a uniform MRI protocol, standardize the image quality of US, and improve the series of techniques for FNAC.</p><p id="Par45">Furthermore, we found that accurate diagnostic results could be obtained by FNAC, which is a minimally invasive technique. In the future, a multicenter reproducibility test should be performed to confirm our findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains
