The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of FE<sub>NO</sub> among infants and toddlers with recurrent wheezing, using both a flow-controlled method under sedation and an awake tidal-breathing method, for the development of school-age asthma and exacerbations and lung function at age 6 years. We found that among wheezy infants and toddlers FE<sub>NO</sub> measured using a flow-controlled technique was predictive of school-age asthma and associated with lung function measures at age 6 years. These results will inform future efforts to develop feasible point-of-care FENO testing methods in wheezy infants and toddlers at risk for asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0002"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 50% of school-age children with persistent asthma developed their first symptoms, typically recurrent episodes of wheezing, between birth and age 3 years.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Recurrent wheezing affects up to a third of infants and toddlers, yet resolves in at least half of these children by school age. Clinicians generally cannot confidently differentiate preschool-age children with transient wheezing from those children with persistent asthma, and an accurate clinical test to predict asthma among infants and toddlers does not currently exist. Current national and international clinical guidelines recommend initiating daily use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for children under age 5 years with &#x0003e;3 prior episodes of wheezing and epidemiologic risk factors for asthma.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These guidelines are based primarily on the Asthma Predictive Index (API) proposed by Castro-Rodriquez et al<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> which is limited by the fact that when validated in a large independent population-based cohort<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the API was found to have a high negative predictive value yet a sensitivity ranging from 28% to 37% and positive predictive value of only 40&#x02013;48% for asthma at school age.</p><p>Clinicians and parents are often reluctant to initiate infants/toddlers on inhaled steroid therapy unless confident about the diagnosis of asthma, a concern heightened by some trials suggesting that treatment of viral-induced wheezing with oral or inhaled steroids in preschool children is ineffective<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and that treatment with inhaled steroids may be associated with reduced growth velocity in children.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, a biomarker able to predict atopic asthma among preschool-age children with recurrent wheezing or other chronic respiratory symptoms would be useful to clinicians as well as investigators testing potential asthma early intervention therapies in infants and toddlers. The fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FE<sub>NO</sub>) is a biomarker for which an extensive body of clinical data support its use in adults and school-age children to identify eosinophilic airway inflammation, support the diagnosis of allergic asthma, and to determine the likelihood of steroid responsiveness in patients with chronic respiratory symptoms.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, there is limited prospective data assessing FE<sub>NO</sub> prospectively among wheezy infants/toddlers who were followed into their school-age years to determine associations with persistent asthma,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and to our knowledge, there are no prospective data assessing associations between FE<sub>NO</sub> measured in wheezy infants and toddlers with asthma exacerbations or lung function at school age among those children. Because the majority of infants and preschool children with recurrent wheezing who go on to develop persistent childhood asthma can be characterized as having an atopic phenotype of asthma,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> FE<sub>NO</sub> may be well suited as a biomarker to separate infants/toddlers with evolving atopic asthma from those with wheezing due to other etiologies.</p><p>In a prospective study Singer et al reported that offline FE<sub>NO</sub> collected during tidal breathing among 166 preschool-age children (median age 36 months, interquartile range 24&#x02013;42 months) was associated with an increased risk for asthma at school age; however, there was considerable overlap between enrollment FE<sub>NO</sub> levels among children with and without asthma at school age, and the association was no stronger than the association between the API at enrollment and asthma at school age in this cohort.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Unsedated tidal-breathing FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements can be technically challenging to measure in infants/toddlers.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Additional limitations of tidal breathing-FE<sub>NO</sub> in infants include: mixing of nasal and lower airway NO sources, and variable expiratory flow which is problematic due to the high flow-dependent nature of FE<sub>NO</sub>.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Despite these potential limitations, it is easier to measure FE<sub>NO</sub> in infants/toddlers during tidal breathing than to measure FE<sub>NO</sub> using a flow-regulated exhalation method.</p><p>We have previously reported that single-breath flow-regulated FE<sub>NO</sub> (SB-FE<sub>NO</sub>) in a cohort of infants and toddlers (mean enrollment age 15.6 months) with a history of recurrent episodes of physician-diagnosed and treated wheezing measured at enrollment was associated with the persistence of wheezing at age 3 years.<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We now report follow-up of this cohort through age 6 years. In a cohort of infants and toddlers enrolled at &#x0003c; age 2 years with recurrent wheezing, our aims were to assess associations between FE<sub>NO</sub> (both SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> measured during sedated infant pulmonary function testing and mixed expired exhaled nitric oxide concentration measured during awake tidal breathing) measured at enrollment and: 1) active persistent asthma at age 6 years, 2) severe asthma exacerbations during the year prior to age 6 years, and 3) lung function measured at age 6 years. We hypothesized that enrollment FE<sub>NO</sub> would be associated with persistent asthma, asthma exacerbations, and/or lung function age at 6 years.

Furthermore, higher concentrations of SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> measured in these infants and toddlers was associated with modestly lower lung function at age 6 years. Finally, subjects with BDR during spirometry at age 6 years had higher enrollment SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> than subjects without BDR at age 6 years. In contrast to flow-controlled sedated SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements, awake tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements at enrollment were not associated with active asthma, a history of severe exacerbations, lower lung function, or BDR at age 6 years.</p><p>Our SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> results are generally consistent with the only other published longitudinal study that we are aware of that attempted to study the predictive power of flow-controlled FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements in infants and toddlers for subsequent asthma during the school-age years. Chang et al reported that in their prospective cohort of infants with atopic dermatitis but without prior wheezing, SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> measured at enrollment (mean age 10.7 months) was predictive of asthma as well as airway reactivity at age 5 years.<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, we believe that our study is the first to perform SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements in a cohort of infants and toddlers with recurrent physician-diagnosed wheezing that were then prospectively followed into the school-age years to determine the predictive value of SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> for school-age asthma, exacerbations, and lung function. Furthermore, we found that an elevated SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> (concentration &#x02265;31.5 ppb) in wheezy infants and toddlers predicted active asthma at age 6 years with a high degree of accuracy (AUC of 0.92, sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value of 81%, negative predictive value of 95% and a relative risk of 16).</p><p>Although the prevalence of recurrent wheezing among infants/toddlers is high, this group of children is heterogeneous. Approximately two thirds of wheezy infants/toddlers will not go on to develop persistent school-age asthma, but rather they wheeze for a variety of anatomic and/or pathophysiologic reasons, including but not limited to small airway caliber, post-viral airway inflammation and injury, dysphagia, or tracheobronchomalacia.<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> For most of these young children, episodic wheezing resolves between ages 3&#x02013;5 years. However, discriminating between infants/toddlers with transient wheezing and young children with evolving asthma is a major challenge for clinicians.<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Prospectively identifying atopic asthma in infants and toddlers with recurrent wheeze using an objective test such as FE<sub>NO</sub> could greatly facilitate more targeted use of asthma therapies, prevent under- and over-treatment with corticosteroids, and be potentially very useful in selecting young children that would be appropriate candidates for future early intervention therapeutic trials targeting children at high risk for atopic endotypes of asthma.</p><p>Although not directly related to our assessment of FE<sub>NO</sub> in this cohort, we observed that parental report of environmental tobacco smoke exposure was not associated with active asthma at age 6 years; however, was associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation between ages 5 and 6 years (<xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Our observations are consistent with recent studies in the literature reporting a lack of association between early life tobacco smoke exposure and the development of asthma by school age,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> yet multiple studies over the past decade have found that environmental tobacco smoke exposure is associated with an increased risk of asthma exacerbations in children with existing asthma.<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> A weakness of our study is that we did not collect objective markers of environmental tobacco smoke exposure (e.g. cotinine levels) at study enrollment or during follow-up. However, the subjects in whom parents reported tobacco smoke exposure at enrollment also reported tobacco smoke exposure at age 6 years. Our findings, in the context of published literature, support the concept that although early life environmental tobacco smoke does not appear to be a causal factor in the development of asthma, it is a risk factor for asthma exacerbations in children with asthma.</p><p>Our observed lack of an association between enrollment tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> measured while subjects were awake and active asthma or a history of severe exacerbations at age 6 years is consistent with several other studies of FE<sub>NO</sub> measured during tidal breathing in young children with recurrent wheezing.<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> There are several potential explanations for the lack of associations between tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> and asthma and lung function measures at age 6 years. First, given that during tidal breathing the soft palate is not closed and nasal NO concentrations are frequently at least 100-fold greater than lower airway NO concentrations there is significant contamination of sampled lower airway NO by nasal NO when measurements are performed during tidal breathing.<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Contamination of measurements by nasal NO therefore would therefore tend to obscure inter-individual differences in lower airway FE<sub>NO</sub> and bias towards a lack of association between tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> and our clinical outcomes. Second, expiratory flow is often quite variable during tidal-breathing measurements conducted in awake young children, which is problematic due to the highly flow dependent nature of FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In contrast, Singer et al demonstrated in a cohort of 391 pre-school age children that FE<sub>NO</sub> measured during tidal breathing was modestly predictive of asthma at age 5 years (AUC of 0.62).<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Despite the limitations of the tidal breathing FE<sub>NO</sub> method, they did demonstrate an association between preschool tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> and school-age asthma, likely due in part due to their larger sample size. However, the relatively weak predictive value of tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> in the Singer study limits the potential utility of tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> as a practical point-of-care clinical test in preschool-age children. Unfortunately, the lack of an association between tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> and asthma at school age dampens enthusiasm for FE<sub>NO</sub> as practical biomarker that could be used clinically on a large scale in wheezy infants and toddlers given that SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements in this age range require that children undergo sedation using a drug that is increasingly difficult to obtain (chloral hydrate) and require highly specialized equipment as well as technical expertise available in a small number of centers worldwide. Although prior studies have demonstrated general associations between FE<sub>NO</sub> and atopy,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and some studies have reported that FE<sub>NO</sub> is associated with atopy but not with asthma,<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> a recent comprehensive comparative effectiveness review of the utility of FE<sub>NO</sub> in asthma management that included 43 studies in adults and children found that although FE<sub>NO</sub> is associated with atopy, FE<sub>NO</sub> concentrations increased the odds of correctly diagnosing asthma between 5.9 and 17-fold, demonstrating that elevated FENO levels are also associated with asthma.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We observed that enrollment FE<sub>NO</sub> was not correlated with total IgE level or positive RAST specific IgE tests in subjects at age 6 years, or with a history of eczema at age 6 years; however, it is possible that with a sufficiently large sample size there might have been an association between FE<sub>NO</sub> and other atopic features that our study was underpowered to detect. Although an association between FE<sub>NO</sub> and atopy is well accepted,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> our data support the concept that FE<sub>NO</sub> is not simply a marker of generalized atopy, but rather a marker of lower airway allergic inflammation that is associated with, and predictive of, atopic asthma in infants and toddlers with recurrent wheezing.</p><p>There are several additional limitations to this study. First, seven subjects were lost to follow-up between enrollment and age 6 years, thus we obtained clinical follow-up in 36 of the 44 subjects (82%) who completed enrollment FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements. Second, although total IgE levels and RAST specific IgE to selected aeroallergens were measured at age 6 years, we did not perform skin or RAST testing of subjects to food or inhalant allergens at study enrollment. Kulig et al demonstrated in a birth cohort that the development of allergic sensitization to inhalant allergens occurs mostly beyond age 2 years,<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> however, ideally we would have characterized the sensitization status of our subjects at both enrollment and age 6 years. Finally, although by study design none of the subjects were using inhaled corticosteroids at enrollment, nine subjects in our study were using inhaled steroids either on a sustained basis or intermittently at age 6 years. All nine subjects who reported sustained or intermittent ICS use at age 6 years were classified as having active asthma, however, ICS use could have decreased the incidence of asthma exacerbations between ages 5 and 6 years. This effect could have biased our results toward weaker associations between enrollment FE<sub>NO</sub> and asthma exacerbations between ages 5 and 6 years or lung function at age 6 years.</p></sec><sec id="S0006"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have demonstrated that higher concentrations of SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> measured in infants and toddlers with a history of recurrent episodes of physician-diagnosed wheezing accurately predicted active asthma at age 6 years, a history of severe asthma exacerbations between ages 5 and 6 years, and lower lung function at age 6 years. Furthermore, enrollment SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> was associated with the presence of BDR during lung function testing at age 6 years. In contrast, tidal-FE<sub>NO</sub> in wheezy infants/toddlers were not associated with asthma, asthma exacerbations, or lung function measures at age 6 years. Unfortunately, SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> measurements require sedation and complex equipment only available in a small number of centers worldwide. Therefore, SB-FE<sub>NO</sub> is not a feasible point-of-care test to predict asthma in wheezy infants and toddlers. However, observations from this cohort strengthen our understanding of NO biology in early childhood asthma and the association of this biomarker with a common endotype of early childhood asthma. Hopefully, our findings will inspire current and future respiratory physiologists and bioengineers to develop new technologies that might allow for point-of-care testing methodologies feasible in awake young children that leverage the associations between airway NO biology and asthma risk to predict atopic asthma in wheezy infants and toddlers.
