In the past decade, previously well-accepted concepts have been continuously challenged by new experimental discoveries. For example, it had previously been widely believed that chromatin is folded into 30-nm fibers (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>), which are assembled into discrete higher-order structures. However, this regular folding hierarchy has been highly debated [see recent review (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>) and references therein] and was not observed in the state-of-the-art electron microscopy tomography (ChromEMT) experiment (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), which instead revealed a highly disordered chromatin polymer that is heterogeneously packed even down to the level of single nucleosomes in situ. This structural heterogeneity of chromatin has been suggested by partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>), a label-free technique, to have a profound regulatory impact on the global transcriptional profile of live single cells (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). At the population-average level, because of the development of chromosome conformation capture (3C) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>) and related techniques, it is becoming well established that chromatin has frequent genomic contacts inside topologically associating domains (TADs) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). A loop extrusion hypothesis based on CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and cohesin proteins was proposed to explain many TAD features at the ensemble level (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). However, the importance of this putative mechanism at the single-cell level has been questioned by recent superresolution fluorescence microscopy experiment (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>), which found chromatin segments to be rich in TAD-like clusters (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>) that are persistent even after cohesin knockout. Together, these new experimental findings remind us of the complexity of chromatin folding, which requires the cooperation of a large family of architectural chromatin-regulatory proteins, as well as the interplay between multiple folding mechanisms such as supercoiling (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>), phase separation (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>), molecular binding (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>), crowding effects (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>), and loop extrusion (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>), all under the feedback control of transcription to be responsive to external stimuli. They also raise many important questions such as (i) what are the functional units of chromatin, (ii) what is the hierarchy of chromatin folding hidden in the disordered morphology, and (iii) what are the inner workings of TADs at the single-cell level. Among these questions, perhaps the most fundamental one is whether there are abstract yet universal folding principles of our genomic code independent of the known molecular and mechanistic complexity.</p><p>To investigate the existence of these principles (mathematical rules) without the burden of accounting for all the physical interactions and biological mechanisms that are far from fully understood, one could search for an abstract folding algorithm that aims to recapitulate the major experimental observations with minimal adjustable parameters and computational complexity, the success of which would suggest a positive answer. Among the chromatin features known to date from experimental results, the most important two are (i) the frequent self-interactions (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>) that link promoters and enhancers for transcriptional regulation and (ii) the heterogeneous packing (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>) that disperses local DNA accessibilities, making room for transcription and nuclear transport. However, there is an apparent conflict between these two major chromatin properties from a polymer physics point of view. For example, it has been hypothesized that chromatin resembles a fractal globule (FG) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>), which is a self-similar polymer in a fully collapsed state. While the FG model predicts the observed high contact frequency, it cannot explain the spatial heterogeneity of chromatin packing. One can prove that it is impossible for any 1D chain to be simultaneous self-similar, rich in self-contacts, and diverse in packing density (see the Supplementary Materials for more details). This trilemma rules out the possibility of chromatin being any kind of fractal chain (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig. S1) and means that chromatin must have distinct folding modes at different length scales. Despite the unknown folding details, this scale dependence has manifested itself in the mass scaling measured by small-angle neutron scattering (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>) and small-angle x-ray scattering (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>), which undergoes a transition from slow to fast as the length scale increases (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Because slow mass scaling is associated with polymer decondensation and therefore less intrapolymer contacts, one would expect chromatin contact frequency to decay faster at a smaller scale. However, high-throughput 3C (Hi-C) experiments indicate a contact scaling transition from slow to fast as the genomic scale increases (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), opposite to the expected result from mass scaling. Moreover, at the small length scale where mass scaling is not even close to 3 (i.e., space filling), chromatin exhibits a remarkably slow power-law decay of contact frequency with a scaling exponent around &#x02212;0.75 inside TADs (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). These abnormal behaviors make chromatin folding not only an intriguing biological question but also a fascinating puzzle for polymer physics.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The paradox of chromatin folding and the basic ideas of SRRW.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chromatin structure cannot be explained by a fractal chain that has anticorrelated contact frequency and density heterogeneity.

The decondensed backbone segments isolate the topological domains and allow them to form larger compartments with high folding variation. We carry out nanoscopic imaging using chromatin scanning transmission electron microscopy (ChromSTEM) and live-cell PWS microscopy to demonstrate DNA packing heterogeneity across different scales, visualizing chromatin domains and compartments at the single-cell level as predicted by our model. Our results support the hypothesis of local DNA density being an important transcriptional regulator and provide a new picture of genomic organization in which chromatin is folded into a variety of minimally entangled hierarchical organizations across length scales ranging between tens of nanometers to micrometers, without requiring a 30-nm fiber. We discuss the quantitative predictions of this folding picture and how they explain a wide range of existing experimental observations. Using heat shock as a model system, we further reveal couplings between chromatin properties during stress response. The strong agreement between our model and experiments on this structural perturbation sheds lights into the structure-function relationship of interphase DNA and suggests the existence of higher-order folding principles and substantial reduction of dimension during genomic landscape exploration. We end the paper by discussing possible molecular mechanisms and biological consequences of this novel organizational paradigm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Self-returning random walk</title><p>Given the enormous size of our genome, coarse graining is necessary in chromatin modeling. Typically, polymer models coarse-grain at least a few kilobases of DNA into one monomer bead to study chromatin structures above 10 Mb. This implicitly restricts the basic repeated unit of the coarse-grained chromatin to be of 30 nm or larger in diameter, incompatible with the recent ChromEMT observation where chromatin is predominantly a heterogeneous assembly of 5- to 24-nm fibers (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). Therefore, instead of large beads of one size, we use steps with a continuous spectrum of step sizes to cover the conformational freedom (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>) of a 10-nm fiber at the kilobase level (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We choose each single step to correspond with 2 kb of DNA, roughly an average of 10 nucleosomes. To capture the frequent genomic contacts, we introduce stochastic, self-returning events (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The return probability is assumed to decay with the length of the current step size <italic>U</italic><sub>0</sub> by a power law<disp-formula id="E1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mtext>return</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x003b1;</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x003b1;</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where &#x003b1; &#x0003e; 1 is the folding parameter for the modeled chromatin. Here, a smaller &#x003b1; leads to a higher return frequency and vice versa. According to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1">Eq. 1</xref>, large steps have a lower probability of returning than small steps do. Therefore, the decondensed and more accessible DNA segments are more likely to be found outside of loops. Once a step is returned, a further return is possible based on the same probability function. With a probability of 1 &#x02212; <italic>P</italic><sub>return</sub>, a jump from the current position can be issued to explore a new point. The jump takes an isotropic direction and a step size <italic>U</italic><sub>1</sub> that follows a power-law distribution<disp-formula id="E2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mtext>jump</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x0003e;</mml:mo><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x003b1;</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>u</italic> is larger than 1, with the resulting smallest step size in reduced units corresponding to roughly 30 nm in the end-to-end distance of the 2-kb nucleosome segment. Likewise, we eliminate unrealistically long step sizes, which correspond to 0.1% of the jumps. To model the confinement effect inside nucleus, we also introduce a global cutoff of 2&#x003b1; times the local cutoff during the conformation generation, which results in a DNA density of ~0.015 bp/nm<sup>3</sup>, comparable to that of an average diploid human eukaryotic nucleus. An accumulated stack of steps (both jumps and returns) tracks the overall conformation of chromatin, while a subset of steps (only the unreturned jumps that are, on average, more stretched) results in the formation of a chromatin &#x0201c;backbone.&#x0201d; With respect to the model, the stochastic jumps and returns thus biologically represent the conformations of 2-kb DNA segments in 3D space where (i) large steps without returns are akin to elongated segments of DNA, (ii) large steps with large returns are branches of loops and supercoiled plectonemes, and (iii) small steps with small returns are compacted clusters. By adding returning to jumping, the model thus turns a nonbranching topology into a branching one, with the degree of structural hierarchy controlled by the folding parameter &#x003b1;. As schematically shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, the overall topological architecture of SRRW is a string of random trees, with the branches formed by the low-frequency returning of long steps and the nodes formed by the clustering of high-frequency returning of short steps. Isolated by the unreturned long backbone segments, the trees integrate nested loops and clusters into domains for co-regulation. One possible realization of these hierarchical structures can be the combination of passive nanoscale phase separation with active supercoiling driven by DNA transcription, as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>. Nested loops formed by molecular binding or extrusion could also contribute to the effective branching of chromatin. In the rest of the paper, we use 50,000 steps to model 100 Mb of DNA, roughly the average genomic size of one entire human chromosome. We use an &#x003b1; around 1.15 to generate structures that resemble interphase chromatin, and we will discuss the implication of this parameter on higher-order chromatin folding.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Chromatin structure and scaling at the single-cell level predicted by SRRW</title><p>At a negligible computational cost, SRRW is able to stochastically generate chromatin-like conformations at 2-kb resolution of high case-to-case variations in spatial organization, but with consistent topological and statistical characteristics controlled by the global folding parameter &#x003b1;. Because of the hierarchical folding, a typical conformation generated by a free SRRW is much more compacted than that generated by a free random walk (RW), as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>. Because we are modeling one single interphase chromosome confined by the surrounding genome, we will focus on a confined SRRW (we keep the generic term SRRW for simplicity) as our chromatin model in the rest of the paper. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and fig.

To better illustrate the spatial organization of the modeled chromatin, we calculated the physical distance matrices at different scales as shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 (I to K)</xref>. The TAD-like domains at the kilobase-to-megabase scale are seen without requiring ensemble averaging, which is in consistence with recent superresolution observations of heterogeneous domains in single cells (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). To allow a more direct comparison between our predicted structures and the state-of-the-art imaging results (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>), we have adapted the experimental resolution of 30 kb by coarse-graining our chromatin model 15-fold. A collection of typical structures of 2-Mb modeled chromatin segments in both 2- and 30-kb resolutions and their physical distance maps are shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, which demonstrates how 3D chromatin clustering leads to various TAD-like 2D patterns. Our model predicts that these clustered contacts at the sub-megabase scale transition into plaid-like patterns at the multi-megabase scale (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>), reminiscent of the AB-compartment patterns (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>) found in Hi-C contact maps. Our distance matrices imply that the 3D genome modeled at the single-cell level is compartmentalized across many scales, which is visualized in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2O</xref>. The compacted yet minimally intermixed 3D packing below 10 Mb is reflected in the root mean square end-to-end distance (<italic>R</italic>) scaling with slope between <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in the corresponding regime (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>). At the genomic scale above 10 Mb, the slope drops to below <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, in line with experimental observation (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>) and signifying a strong intermixture of large compartments. Nevertheless, at this scale, the modeled chromatin intermixes as clumps rather than wires, which would be expected to result in strong internal friction rather than entanglement.</p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Typical local chromatin structure predictions.</title><p>Five examples of 2 Mb of DNA at 2- and 30-kb resolutions and their physical distance maps (in micrometers) at the single-cell level predicted by the SRRW model.

Comparing intra- and intertree contacts, our model predicts that, in single cells, the genomic isolation across tree domains can be as large as 10-fold near the 1-Mb range, much higher than the puzzlingly small twofold isolation across TADs at the population-average level observed in Hi-C experiments (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>). The sufficient isolation at the single-cell level predicted by our model is provided by the elongated intertree backbone segments (~5% of the modeled chromatin), which are expected to be openly accessible and transcriptionally active. This prediction naturally explains the experimental finding that TAD boundaries are active in transcription (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>). Because tree domains can further cluster and a large tree domain itself has a structural hierarchy, the contact pattern at the TAD (megabase) scale is therefore hierarchical (fig. S3). Whether this hierarchy extends to large scales is a matter of debate (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). While SRRW predicts compartmentalized organizations at different scales, the arrangement of the compartments at the largest scale (&#x0003e;10 Mb) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>) is nonhierarchical and can be unraveled to a polymeric string of tree domains (represented by beads), as shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2P</xref>. This &#x0201c;secondary&#x0201d; structure of our modeled chromatin highlights the functional importance of the tree domains, which exert strong topological constraints on the genomic organization at the single-cell level.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tree domains and larger compartments in a 3D forest</title><p>The SRRW model predicts that the topological domains at the single-cell level have random tree structures. These tree domains are amalgams of chromatin nanoclusters and loops (likely supercoiled) at the kilobase-to-megabase scale and serve as building blocks of larger packing domains, i.e., the compartments of tree domains at the single-cell level. Collectively, these tree domains form a &#x0201c;3D forest&#x0201d; within a chromosome territory. A 3D map of tree domains of a typical chromatin structure predicted by SRRW is shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, with the color corresponding to the genomic size of each tree domain. The physical sizes of the tree domains measured by their radius of gyrations (<italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub>) are positively correlated with their genomic sizes but with considerable dispersion (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The peak <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> of tree domains is around 70 nm, as shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. The genomic size distribution of the tree domains is shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, featuring a broad spectrum and an abundance of small domains. The average genomic size is around 50 kb, while most of the DNA is packed in tree domains around 300 kb, resembling the typical size of TAD at the Hi-C level (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>). Recent high-resolution TAD analyses revealed a large population of small TADs of tens of kilobases (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>), which aligns well with our tree-domain analysis at the single-cell level. Note that the genomic size distribution of tree domains is predicted to be strongly non-Gaussian with a heavy tail. As a result, the median size is much smaller than the average size. It is interesting that significant median-average discrepancy has also been reported for TADs whose median size is about 185 kb (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>) and average size is about 800 kb (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). While the values would depend on the Hi-C resolution, the heavy-tailed domain statistics has been shown in recent sub-kilobase Hi-C analysis (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>). Our model suggests that this non-Gaussian statistics is a general feature of chromatin, in contrast to normal polymer behavior (fig.

We have observed a positive correlation between the genomic size of tree domains and the local packing density walking along the modeled chromatin sequence (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), suggestive of a size-dependent domain activity that is in line with recent finding that active domains are small in genomic size (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). The more condensed packing of larger tree domains is reflected in a decrease of the <italic>R</italic> scaling factor in the sub-megabase regime (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>). Using a dichotomy of low (red) and high (blue) packing densities (low density defined as below 80% of mean), we found a quasi&#x02013;self-similar density pattern (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, top</xref>) along the sequence of our modeled chromatin. Resembling the experimentally observed AB-compartment activity alternation (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>), this pattern reflects an emergence of higher-order compartmentalization above tree domains as implied by the plaid-like matrix in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>. These multitree packing domains emerge because of the L&#x000e9;vy flight&#x02013;like statistics of the secondary structure of SRRW (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2P</xref>), which is non-Gaussian and inhomogeneous at large length scale. The higher-order compartmentalization, however, does not compromise the physical identities of individual tree domains. As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 (F to H)</xref>, the tree domains (randomly colored) are physical entities with minimal intermixing. Their hierarchical inner structure also lowers the risk of self-entanglement and knotting at the sub-megabase level. These structural properties make tree domains good candidates for the functional modules of chromatin at the single-cell level. The similarities between our single-cell predictions and the population-level Hi-C observations suggest that TADs are the statistical consequence of chromatin folding into tree-like topological domains (fig. S3).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A quasi&#x02013;self-similar heterogeneous packing picture of chromatin</title><p>One natural yet important structural consequence of SRRW is that the packing density is highly nonuniform across many length scales. To highlight the multi-megabase compartments, we calculated a 3D density map with the nanoscale density fluctuations filtered out. In <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, the compartments are demonstrated in a colored particle representation, with larger and darker particles corresponding to higher compartmental DNA density. The cross sections of the filtered 3D density map in all three directions are displayed in density heat maps (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, top). Zooming into a local fraction of the modeled chromatin (without an applied filter) reveals nanoscale domains that are interconnected by physically extended backbone segments (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, bottom left) and rich in high-density tree nodes, as highlighted by golden particles in the second bottom panel of <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>. Our results are consistent with the experimental observation of widespread chromatin nanoclusters or clutches interspersed by nucleosome-depleted regions (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>) and further suggest that large clutches as large tree nodes host higher-order interactions. Our structural prediction of the spatial separation of open and condensed chromatin domains, with the latter being larger clumps, is also remarkably in line with recent superresolution observation where active and repressive histone marks have little colocalization and correlate respectively with small low-density and large high-density DNA regions (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><italic>44</italic></xref>). Our prediction of the ubiquitous alternation between open and condensed chromatin domains suggests that transcriptional activation and repression are highly coupled, similar to the two sides of a coin. In particular, the model predicts that segments with higher transcriptional propensity tend to serve as stronger isolators between neighboring domains (fig. S3). The granular packing structure depicted by SRRW registers large surface area and rich porosity, resulting in a similarly heterogeneous encompassing media that could serve as a nuclear channel system (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>). Such a unique space-filling property of SRRW sets it apart from normal disordered polymers, by greatly widening the local DNA density spectrum as shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>.

Because the scattering experiments do not distinguish nuclear molecules, we carried out a ChromSTEM method that focuses on the DNA mass distribution. Combining electron microscopy and DNA staining, ChromSTEM captures nucleosome-level chromatin nanostructure (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>). Consistent with recent ChromEMT observations, no 30-nm fibers were observed. The DNA mass scaling readout of ChromSTEM (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>) confirmed the biphasic behavior predicted by the SRRW model. Despite the slow mass scaling at the small length scale, the tree topology predicted by our model enables high contact frequency within the nanoscale chromatin domains (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2N</xref>), reconciling the contact-structure conundrum present in nonbranching polymer models of the higher-order chromatin organization. A DNA density map based on ChromSTEM reveals a granular and porous packing of DNA as shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>, in line with our prediction. Notably, the peak radius of the chromatin domains revealed by ChromSTEM is around 70 nm (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>), which is consistent with recent single-cell fluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>) and coincides with the peak <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> of tree domains predicted by SRRW (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The excellent agreement between our model and nanoscopic imaging strongly suggests the existence of functional chromatin modules with minimal intermixing at the sub-megabase level in single cells. From the nanoclusters (clutches) to the tree domains, and to the larger-scale compartments (packing domains), our model predicts that chromatin has persistent packing heterogeneity across many length scales, hence resembling mass fractals (granular and porous in a quasi&#x02013;self-similar way) at the single-cell level. To further investigate chromatin packing in live cells, we next performed optical imaging using PWS microscopy (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). As a label-free technique, PWS microscopy noninvasively measures the intracellular macromolecular arrangement and detects mass fractal&#x02013;like structures.

At the tree domain level, a small &#x003b1; promotes the formation of large tree domains and concomitantly more nanoclusters or clutches (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>) as tree nodes, whereas a large &#x003b1; reduces the branching and clustering of the modeled chromatin.

As schematically shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, a global architecture rich in large tree domains (small &#x003b1;) has more polarized local DNA accessibility and hence transcription activity. While there is more DNA densely packed in large tree domains with more condensed tree nodes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and fig.

Numerical analyses of the average tree domain size and backbone openness (physical extent) as functions of &#x003b1; have confirmed this picture and are shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>. Our analysis also shows that polarization of chromatin accessibility is coupled with DNA packing heterogeneity (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). To study the local contact-structure relation, we analyzed the contact frequency scaling and the <italic>R</italic> scaling for the modeled chromatin segments of 100 kb to 1 Mb. We fitted the scaling curves to power laws and extracted scaling factors (fig. S6). An effective mass scaling factor <italic>D</italic> defined as the inverse of <italic>R</italic> scaling factor measures the mass scaling based on consecutive DNA mass with definite segment length. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref> shows that <italic>D</italic> decreases as &#x003b1; goes up, anticorrelated with the contact scaling <italic>s</italic>, but correlates with the local packing heterogeneity. The coupling between mass scaling and structural heterogeneity suggests, again, that chromatin compartments or packing domains can be approximated as a mass fractal with its structural heterogeneity quantified by a fractal dimension <italic>D</italic>. Note that our prediction of higher chromatin heterogeneity fostering more genomic contacts contrasts the behavior of a fractal chain (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The reason why chromatin resembles 3D mass fractal rather than 1D fractal chain is due to the prevailing clusters and branches that lead to a heterogeneous and porous structure.</p><p>The above theoretical analysis suggests that during chromatin structural alternation, which could happen when cell responses to stress, the perturbations of many chromatin properties are coupled. Here, we test this prediction using heat shock as model experimental system. We analyze the contact maps (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, G and H</xref>) and contact probability curves (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K</xref>) at normal temperature and exposed to heat shock using the publicly available Hi-C data on hESCs (human embryonic stem cells) [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) access code GSE105028] (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr"><italic>46</italic></xref>). We noticed a decrease in contact probability scaling with the heat shock compared to the control condition, which signifies an increase in long-range contacts in hESCs subjected to heat shock. A similar trend has been observed in previous literature for heat shock experiments on <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><italic>47</italic></xref>), signifying that this increase in long-range contacts may be an evolutionarily conserved part of the heat shock response. We have carried out live-cell PWS measurements on HCT116 cells to study the effect of heat shock on the packing heterogeneity of chromatin. As shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 (I and J)</xref>, we observed that temperature stress led to a higher PWS signal that means more heterogeneous packing of live-cell chromatin.

We performed additional PWS experiments on A549 lung adenocarcinoma and differentiated BJ fibroblast cell lines and observed the same trend of increased fractal dimension upon heat shock stimulation (fig. S9). Our model also suggests that the formation of long-range genomic contacts is coupled with promotion of high-density chromatin clusters, in line with the Hi-C report that chromatin forms more polycomb-silenced heterochromatin while increasing its self-interaction frequencies during heat shock (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><italic>47</italic></xref>). Moreover, upon treatment of both A2780 and A2780 m248 ovarian cancer cell lines with 100 &#x003bc;M valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, we observe a significant decrease in mass fractal dimension <italic>D</italic>, which we would expect to result in an increase in contact probability scaling <italic>s</italic>, demonstrating the importance of histone markers in determining chromatin-chromatin interactions and altering global structural properties of chromatin (fig. S10). Together, our theoretical and experimental results suggest that structural hierarchy, packing heterogeneity, genomic interaction, and transcriptional polarization are intimately coupled during epigenetic reconfiguration.</p><p>As schematically shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6N</xref>, transcription could play an important role in these couplings. The divergent transcriptions are expected to generate overwound DNA flanked by promoters, facilitating nucleosome deposition and plectonemic supercoils. The merging of small plectonemes and the branching of large plectonemes can lead to tree-like structures. On the other hand, convergent transcriptions between tree domains can generate underwound DNA, which tends to evict histones and stiffen the chromatin fiber, resulting in open backbones. In this case, part of the torsion can be stored in small tree domains, which can be easily activated as transcription proceeds. The activating and repressing factors are expected to concentrate at different domains and facilitate their phase separation at larger scales. In this picture, transcription shapes the packing of remote DNA, while chromatin packing, in return, regulates the local activity of transcription. Because chromatin packing can be globally affected by physiochemical factors such as temperature, pH, and ionic strength, macrogenomic engineering (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>) that regulates the global gene expression pattern through chromatin packing control can be useful to treat systems biology diseases such as cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion|conclusions" disp-level="1"><title>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</title><p>In this paper, we asked the question of how chromatin folds to achieve simultaneously high self-interacting frequency and high space-filling heterogeneity.

Here, we integrated modeling and imaging to understand 3D genome at the single-cell level. We have carried out ChromSTEM and PWS measurements to quantify the heterogeneity of chromatin packing across different length scales. At the nanoscale, concurring with recent study (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), we did not observe the 30-nm fiber and instead revealed a granular packing structure with prevailing nanodomains of a peak radius around 70 nm (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). To characterize chromatin packing at larger scales and in live cells, we have conducted PWS microscopy to reveal that heterogeneous packing domains exist throughout the nucleus (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Our multiscale imaging suggests a quasi&#x02013;self-similar picture of chromatin packing. Using heat shock as an example, we demonstrated that the average heterogeneity characterized by a mass fractal dimension is sensitive to environmental change and could serve as an indicator of chromatin folding state (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, I and J</xref>).</p><p>There is a subtle yet important topological difference between a fractal chain and a mass fractal, as the former does not branch. For 1D chain, there is a trilemma between high packing heterogeneity, high contact frequency, and self-similarity. This means that the presumed nonbranching topology and the strict scale invariance of chromatin must be broken to unify high packing heterogeneity and contact frequency, hence necessitating distinct folding modes at different scales. In this light, we carried out ChromSTEM to find a transition in the mass scaling near 100 nm (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), close to the peak domain radius. Note that the scale-dependent power laws have also been reported in literature for chromatin contact frequency (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>) and mean square distance (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><italic>48</italic></xref>). To understand the scale-dependent packing modes, we introduced an SRRW model, which generates tree-like topological domains with hierarchical structures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The tree domains pack local genomic DNA into nested loops and nanoclusters with high contact frequency at the sub-megabase scale and constitute mass fractal&#x02013;like compartments at the multi-megabase scale (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We predict that an open chromatin backbone connects and isolates the tree domains, rendering highly porous chromatin structure, flexible higher-order folding, and irregularly shaped chromosome territory (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A to C</xref>). Our model agrees well with our experiments demonstrating a heterogeneous chromatin structure across many length scales (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D to I</xref>). Moreover, the model predicts an anticorrelation between contract frequency scaling and packing heterogeneity, consistent with our experimental observation of heat shock response (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting that our model predicts TAD-like and AB compartment&#x02013;like patterns on a distance matrix at the single-cell level (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, I to K</xref>), resembling the Hi-C contact patterns (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>) at the population level. This resemblance becomes more intriguing, because the model further predicts a counteraction between the two single-cell organizational modes (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>), reminiscent of the similar phenomenon at the population level reported in Hi-C experiments (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). This suggests that well-organized 3D structures such as domains and compartments are intrinsic chromatin characteristics at the single-cell level rather than merely statistical patterns of large population (fig. S3). Furthermore, our model predicts that the 3D genome is more structured than that suggested by population-level contact patterns. Beyond the average twofold isolation associated with TADs (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>), tree domains allow single-cell chromatin structure to realize 5- to 10-fold probability difference between the intra- and interdomain contacts at the 100-kb to 1-Mb level (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2N</xref>). This apparent contradiction between our single-cell level prediction and the population-level observation of genomic contacts can be resolved by noting that the cell-to-cell variability of genomic organization is high (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). Compared to the diffuse and intermixing loops predicted by the loop extrusion hypothesis (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>), our model depicts more compacted and isolated physical entities in single cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), rich in spontaneous higher-order interactions as revealed by recent superresolution experiment (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). In line with recent Hi-C reports (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>), statistical analysis of our modeled chromatin suggests that there are prevailing small domains at the single-cell level, followed by a heavy tail of larger ones (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Our model further predicts a correlation between local DNA density and domain size (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), which lends explanation to the experimental finding that small domains are, on average, more active than large ones (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). Last, our prediction that tree domains are isolated by easily accessible chromatin backbone segments (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2P</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) is consistent with the observation that TAD boundaries are enriched in active genes (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>).</p><p>It is remarkable that by resolving the contact-structure paradox (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), a minimal model is able to pivot a wide array of chromatin features including untangled compaction (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>), disordered morphology (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), nonglobular territory (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>), porous nuclear medium (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>), biphasic chromatin mass scaling (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>), abundance of nanoclusters or clutches (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>), non-Gaussian domain size distribution (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>), size-dependent domain activity (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>), active domain boundaries (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>), higher-order interactions (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>), and multiple layers of chromatin organization (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). This suggests an emerging picture that, on top of the first-order genomic structure, namely, the linear DNA double helix for data reproduction, our genome has evolved to physically adopt virtual tree data structure (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) for its higher-order functional modules to better organize the enormous genomic information. In this regard, functional optimization may be a better perspective to understand chromatin folding than polymer physics. In particular, we argue that forming a string of tree-like topological domains connected by open backbone segments has functional advantages in (i) proper organization of genomic contacts, (ii) packing-based regulation of transcription, (iii) transport and accommodation of nuclear proteins, and (iv) transition between interphase and mitosis.</p><p>Proper genomic contacts based on chromatin folding are critical to cell function. In stark contrast to the equilibrium globule reference (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F to H</xref>), we have shown that our model promotes short-range contacts and suppresses long-range (multi-megabase and above) contacts. Because longer-range contacts have more combinatorial possibilities, this suggests that chromatin folding can significantly lower the information entropy of genomic interaction, despite the observed &#x0201c;disordered&#x0201d; polymer structure (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). This ordered genomic organization not only enhances the local regulatory contacts within hierarchical domains but also restricts random long-range contacts that could lead to aberrant functions.</p><p>The identity of cell often depends on the coordination of highly active and strictly silenced genes, which requires a polarized transcription pattern. As shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, compared to a confined RW globule, our chromatin model has a broader spectrum of local DNA density with both boosted low-density and high-density regimes. In line with the emerging hypothesis that local chromatin packing density regulates the transcriptional activity, this packing heterogeneity predicted by our model provides a prerequisite physical environment for polarized gene expression. On the other hand, the quasi&#x02013;self-similar packing picture revealed by our experiments and model (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and fig. S2) is advantageous in supporting fast transport of nuclear proteins of varying sizes. This porosity across many length scales can also accommodate the experimentally observed clusters and condensates from tens of nanometer to micrometer scale that are composed of different transcription factors, DNA-processing enzymes, and chromatin architectural proteins.</p><p>It is worth noting that, in our model, most chromatin is packed into tree domains, whereas only about 5% of interphase DNA is exposed in the backbone segments that are physically extended and of high transcriptional competence. It is this minority of the heterogeneous biopolymer that creates most of the low DNA density regions in the porous chromatin structure. Recent in vitro experiment (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><italic>49</italic></xref>) confirmed a condensin loop extrusion mechanism (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><italic>50</italic></xref>) on naked DNA, which is strictly one-sided and has been argued (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr"><italic>51</italic></xref>) to be far from sufficient for mitotic condensation. Nevertheless, on the basis of our prediction that only about 5% of the DNA swells the porous chromosome territory, the one-sided condensin extrusion on this extended backbone of chromatin could have a considerable effect of collapsing interphase DNA into mitotic form. This backbone extrusion could preserve the folding memory of chromatin into the topological information of tree domains, although most of the Hi-C detectable spatial proximity information between loci is inevitably lost during the transition from interphase to mitosis. In this manner, our folding picture allows reconciliation between mitotic condensation and folding memory inheritance. Consistently, recent superresolution single-nucleosome tracking suggested the existence of chromatin domains throughout the cell cycle (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). The reported peak radius of the domains is about 80 nm, similar to our ChromSTEM measurement and model&#x02019;s prediction.</p><p>The formation of tree domains predicted by our model allows the functional modules of chromatin to have topological identities (a robust way to store information). However, these topological domains cannot be self-assembled without energy input (note that SRRW as a folding algorithm is not a memory-less Markov process and cannot happen at thermodynamic equilibrium). Nevertheless, a tree-like topology of chromatin segment is not totally unexpected because looping and supercoiling can effectively branch the biopolymer. Given the structural complexity and heterogeneity of tree domains predicted by SRRW, we expect the folding process to involve a diversity of molecular mechanisms to act in concert under the guidance of genetic (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr"><italic>52</italic></xref>) and epigenetic (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr"><italic>53</italic></xref>) codes. These could include transcription-induced supercoiling (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>), phase separation (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>), long noncoding RNA (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr"><italic>54</italic></xref>), DNA-mediated charge transfer (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr"><italic>55</italic></xref>), and the putative cohesive-CTCF loop extrusion (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). In particular, DNA-mediated charge transfer could enable fast long-range communication between responsible architectural proteins in a transcription-sensitive manner, whereas long noncoding RNA could allow slow but more specific loci communication and recruitment of folding agents. Given the hierarchical nature of the tree topology, we expect both the assembly and disassembly of the tree domains to be hierarchical processes, meaning that small tree domains can group into large ones where they become subdomains and vice versa similar to chemical reactions. During these grouping and ungrouping processes, backbone segments can be absorbed into new tree domains, and new backbone segments can be exposed. For a steady state when the cell is not preparing for division, we expect the overall statistics (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), i.e., the tree size distribution, the degree of structural hierarchy, and the portion of backbone segments, to be stable. Similar to the inheritance of noncoding DNA (&#x0003e;90% of genome), maintaining physically extended backbone segments (~5% of genome) and their low DNA density local environment inside the highly crowded nucleus may seem uneconomical, because energy needs to be consumed against the conformational entropy of chromatin that tends to homogenize the DNA concentration. This puzzle could be explained by recent experimental finding that droplet of nuclear proteins initialized by DNA binding mechanically dispels heterochromatin and promotes the formation of low DNA density region (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). This picture is consistent with another recent observation that the total euchromatin density including proteins is only 1.5-fold lower than that of the surrounding heterochromatin, despite the 5.5- to 7.5-fold DNA density difference (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr"><italic>56</italic></xref>). Together, the formation of both tree domains and chromatin backbone in vivo is not only functionally desirable but also mechanistically possible.</p><p>The fact that many major chromatin features can be explained by an abstract folding algorithm indicates the existence of universal principles for chromatin to functionally fold and efficiently explore the genomic landscape. Our results suggest a global coupling between different chromatin properties including domain hierarchy, nanocluster size distribution, backbone openness, packing heterogeneity, genomic interaction, and transcriptional polarization, which means a substantial dimensionality reduction during chromatin folding due to the emergence of collective folding parameters or susceptibilities (for example, &#x003b1; in SRRW). This folding picture sheds new lights into the physics of epigenetics and stresses the importance of understanding 3D genome from a data structure point of view (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) on top of polymer physics, because chromatin folding is optimizing biological functions rather than minimizing thermodynamic free energy. The unexpected positive correlation between genomic contact scaling and DNA packing heterogeneity of living chromatin under heat shock is one example.</p><p>In summary, we have combined theoretical and experimental efforts to understand chromatin topology, statistics, scaling, and their couplings at the single-cell level. Our multiscale results, from kilobase-level nanoclusters to 100 Mb&#x02013;level chromosome territories, provide an integrative view of higher-order chromatin folding as an alternative thinking to the classical 30-nm fiber&#x02013;based picture. Our prediction that chromatin folds into tree-like topological domains connected by an active backbone explains and reconciles a wealth of exotic properties of this living biopolymer that are alien to the common sense of polymer physics. It is remarkable that despite the distinct folding modes at different scales, chromatin is able to maintain alternation between active and inactive states across many scales both in space and on DNA sequence, in a quasi&#x02013;self-similar manner. The non-Gaussian folding statistics and global coupling between chromatin properties suggest that interphase DNA explores the great genomic landscape as a complex network rather than a simple polymer. The possibility of chromatin having tree data structures and universal folding principles opens an exciting new paradigm to understand genomic organization and presents many new questions, the answering of which would require collaborations between experimentalists and theorists from different fields. We hope that our insights in this paper could inspire future interdisciplinary efforts on this grand challenge of life science.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Model</title><p>The folding algorithm of SRRW is given in the main text. Here, we summarized some parameters we used in the model and data analysis. The smallest step size in the model is 30 nm. For local DNA density analysis, we used a probe of 150-nm radius. For contact frequency calculation, we chose a contact criterion to be two loci being within 45 nm. The single-cell level modeling and analyses were performed at &#x003b1; = 1.15. The local and global cutoffs in this case are 24.85 and 57.15 in reduced units. The local cutoff was chosen to cover the length of a fully stretched 2-kb DNA double helix. The global cutoff was chosen to render a reasonable size of chromosome territory with an average DNA density that is comparable to that of diploid human nucleus. Population-level modeling and analyses were performed over 1000 independent samples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and human skin fibroblast (BJ) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

The cells were fixed in 2.5% EM grade glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde (EMS, USA) in 1&#x000d7; sodium cacodylate buffer for 20 min at room temperature and 1 hour on ice. All the following steps were conducted on ice or a customized cold stage with temperature control, and the reagents used in the protocol were prechilled in the fridge or on ice. After fixation, the cells were stained with DRAQ5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) that intercalates double-stranded DNA and bathed in 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). An inverted microscopy (Eclipse, Nikon, Japan) was used for photobleaching. Each spot was photobleached for 7 min by epi-illumination with a 100&#x000d7; objective. Osmium ferrocyanide was used to further enhance contrast of the DNA, and standard Durcupan resin (EMS, USA) embedding was carried out. After curing for 48 hours at 60&#x000b0;C, ultrathin sections were prepared by an ultramicrotome (UC7, Leica, USA) and deposited onto plasma-treated TEM grid with formar-carbon film (EMS, USA). To investigate the CVC (chromatin volume concentration) and radius of the chromatin nanodomains, dual-axis STEM high-angle annular dark-field tomography was performed on the 100-nm ultrathin section of A549 cell nucleus with 10-nm colloidal gold fiducial markers. The sample was tilted from &#x02212;60&#x000b0; to 60&#x000b0; with 2&#x000b0; step along the two perpendicular axes. IMOD (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr"><italic>57</italic></xref>) was used to align the tilt series, and the tomography reconstruction was conducted in TomoPy (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr"><italic>58</italic></xref>) using a penalized maximum likelihood algorithm (PLM-hybrid) for each axis. The combination of tomograms was performed using IMOD to further suppress the influence of missing cone. Furthermore, to estimate the average cluster size for the whole nucleus across multiple cells experimentally, mass scaling analysis of TEM projection images on ultrathin sections of BJ cells was performed.
