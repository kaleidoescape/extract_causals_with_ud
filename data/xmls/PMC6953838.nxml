However, the effects of one specific type of social norms&#x02013;in-group norms about intergroup contact&#x02013;have not yet been extensively studied, especially among groups of different status or in different intergroup contexts. The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of three types of contact norms (peer, parental and school) on four intergroup outcomes (in-group bias, social distance, tendency to discriminate, prosocial behaviour towards the outgroup) among ethnic majority and minority adolescents from four different intergroup contexts of the Republic of Croatia, as well as to test for moderating effects of age, social status and intergroup context in the strength of these effects. The research was carried out on a sample of 1440 elementary and high school students, members of Croatian majority, and Serbian, Hungarian, Czech, and Italian minority. The results indicated that although all three types of norms predict most of the intergroup outcomes, their relative importance depends on the specific type of intergroup outcome (attitudinal or behavioural), group social status (majority or minority), intergroup context (history of a recent intergroup conflict or not), and for peer norms on the age of the adolescent.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004488</institution-id><institution>Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IP-2014-09-4499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biru&#x00161;ki</surname><given-names>Dinka &#x0010c;orkalo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The research for this paper was financially supported by the Croatian Science Foundation [grant no.

Some authors even argue that stereotypes and prejudices are predominantly the result of shared in-group norms [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The idea is based on the assumption that individuals belonging to subjectively meaningful social groups learn and share information about the appropriate treatment of relevant outgroups and that such information influences their intergroup attitudes and behaviours. A substantive body of research involving adults, children and adolescents has confirmed that in-group norms, as perceived by the group members, predict a wide range of intergroup outcomes, such as in-group favouritism [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], outgroup attitudes [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], quantity and quality of intergroup contact [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as well as positive and negative intergroup behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, in previous research, norms related to intergroup behaviours have been conceptualised in different ways, including norms about the expression or suppression of prejudices (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), norms regarding general attitudes towards outgroup members (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) and more recently norms about intergroup contacts (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). As intergroup contact in its various forms is one of the crucial factors determining the relationships between different social groups [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the present study focuses on the content and effects of norms about intergroup contact. Because adolescence is a developmental period in which intergroup attitudes, as well as awareness of and conformity to in-group norms become increasingly important [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we will explore normative influences on interethnic relations of adolescents.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>In-group norms about intergroup contact</title><p>In-group norms about intergroup contact can be thought of as perceptions of typicality or social approval of intergroup contact in one&#x02019;s immediate social context. They provide information if and to what extent the in-group members associate with the outgroups, and if they approve and encourage positive intergroup interactions. This information is important because if people perceive that in-group members prohibit or avoid cross-group relations, their own relations with the outgroup are likely to be negatively affected. Conversely, the perception of positive norms should lead to better personal contact experiences, and consequently to more favourable intergroup outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Research focusing on broader in-group contact norms (i.e. norms held by the whole in-group or by a range of referents within the in-group) has shown that perceiving positive norms about intergroup contact is related to more intergroup empathy and trust [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], positive outgroup attitudes and expectancies for future contact [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], as well as decreased intergroup anxiety and threat ([<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Study 1). Although general group norms are undoubtedly important, people are usually influenced by several specific normative in-group sources operating in their proximal social environment. For children and adolescents, the most important influences come from their parents, peers and school.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Parental norms</title><p>Parents as primary socialisation agents influence intergroup attitudes of their children considerably (for a review, see [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), and much of that influence is likely to be achieved through the perception of and adherence to parental norms. Parental intergroup behaviours (e.g. their own interactions with members of the outgroup) and other messages they send (e.g. explicit messages about acceptability of intergroup contact) can contribute to how their children perceive the norms about intergroup contact. Indeed, children&#x02019;s reactions to parental norms have been widely studied, which is not the case with adolescents.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are findings indicating considerable influence of parental norms on adolescents&#x02019; intergroup attitudes. For example, M&#x000e4;h&#x000f6;nen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] studied how perceived attitudes of family members towards immigrants relate to blatant and subtle immigrant attitudes of Finnish adolescents. They found that the perception of family norms regarding outgroup attitudes had a direct effect on adolescents&#x02019; attitudes, and a moderating effect on the relationship between quality of interethnic contact and subtle attitudes of boys. In addition, Edmonds and Killen [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found a strong relationship between perceived parental norms about cross-race relationships and adolescents&#x02019; intergroup contact. Although they did not measure normative effects on adolescents&#x02019; attitudes, we know that outgroup attitudes are generally related to personal contact experiences [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In other words, it is possible that parental norms influence adolescents&#x02019; attitudes both directly and indirectly, by influencing their willingness to engage in intergroup contact. The proposed direct effect was supported by Ata et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], who showed that perceived parental approval of intergroup contact was negatively related to adolescents&#x02019; social distance towards Muslims.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Peer norms</title><p>Children and adolescents are not influenced only by the norms conveyed by their parents. As they grow older, peers and friends become increasingly important factors in their social experiences. Indeed, research has shown that with transition from childhood to adolescence peer relations become more frequent and more salient, and adolescents attach great importance to perceived expectations and norms of their peer groups [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Perception of intergroup contacts of their peers and related norms the peers convey may influence adolescents&#x02019; relations with outgroup members regardless of their own attitudes towards intergroup contact. Unlike parental norms, effects of peer norms about intergroup contact have been studied more extensively. For example, De Tezanos-Pinto et. al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that perceiving norms against intergroup contacts among in-group friends is related to negative outgroup attitudes of adolescents. Furthermore, perceived peer norms supporting cross-group relations were also associated with higher perceived outgroup variability, both directly and through increased empathy towards the outgroup [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Finally, positive peer contact norms were also related to prosocial outgroup behaviour through increased quantity and quality of intergroup contact [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Although both peers and parents have significant roles in shaping adolescents&#x02019; behaviours in various domains, there is little research comparing their relative normative effects on intergroup attitudes and behaviours. Moreover, it has been suggested that the importance of parental and peer influences generally varies with the age of adolescent, though there are two contrasting views on the age-related changes in the strength of these influences. Due to the growing need for autonomy and increasing time adolescents spend with their peers, some authors have argued that peer influences strengthen in middle adolescence (i.e. 12 to 15 years), while parental influences decrease steadily with age [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Conversely, more recent research has shown that resistance to peer influence increases linearly throughout adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In one of the few studies examining simultaneously peer and family normative influences on intergroup attitudes during middle adolescence, M&#x000e4;h&#x000f6;nen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found that perceptions of family and peer attitudes towards immigrants have equally strong direct effects on intergroup attitudes of Swedish adolescents. In contrast, a longitudinal study of Miklikowska [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which focused on actual rather than perceived attitudes of parents and peers, showed that parental self-reported attitudes predicted changes in anti-immigrant attitudes of Swedish youth in both early and mid-adolescence, while the effects of peers were limited to early adolescence, suggesting that their normative impact diminishes over time. However, to our knowledge, no research has examined which of the perceived norms about contact with the outgroup&#x02013;those of parents or peers&#x02014;have a stronger influence on intergroup attitudes and behaviours of adolescents and whether the strength of these influences differs depending on adolescents&#x02019; age.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>School norms</title><p>In his influential contact hypothesis, Allport [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] proposed that support of intergroup contact from relevant authorities and institutions establishes a norm of acceptance, and thus increases the positive effects of intergroup contact on attitudes. The norms that adolescents perceive within their schools, as institutions in which they spend a significant amount of their time, may thus influence their intergroup attitudes and behaviours. If these influences are confirmed, school norms may have an especially important role in the development of positive intergroup relations, as rules, messages and values in the school context are generally more amenable to change then those in the peer and family environments.</p><p>The effects of perceived school norms have so far been mostly examined in relation to intergroup contact outcomes, and often in contrast to the effect of peer norms. For instance, Schachner and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found that positive contact norms in the classroom (i.e. perceived support for intergroup contact and cooperation from teachers and students) significantly predicted early adolescents&#x02019; intentions to socialise with the outgroup, as well as actual intergroup friendships. In a recent cross-sectional study comparing the effects of peer and school norms, Tropp et al. ([<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Study 1) showed that perceived norms supporting cross-ethnic relations among school staff and peers predicted greater interest and comfort in cross-ethnic relations, and higher contact quality among ethnic majority and minority students. Moreover, the effects of perceived peer norms were stronger than those of the school. However, in their longitudinal study perceived school contact norms predicted greater interest, comfort and quality of intergroup contact over time ([<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Study 2).</p><p>In addition to contact outcomes, experimental research with children suggests that intergroup attitudes can also be affected by perceived peer and school norms. For example, Nesdale and Lawson [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] observed that experimentally manipulated school and peer norms of inclusion lead to more positive attitudes towards outgroup members independently of each other. However, one of the few research studies looking at different roles of peer and school norms in explaining adolescents' intergroup behaviours, showed that perception of school norms about intergroup contact, unlike perception of peer norms, was not related to either positive or negative intergroup behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Although the studies so far did examine the relative influences of peer and school contact norms in adolescents of different ages, none of them have explicitly tested the potential age differences in the strength of those influences which could possibly explain inconsistencies in the findings in different studies. Moreover, the relative effects of three types of norms that are important for adolescents (parental, peer and school norms) are still unclear.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Normative effects in diverse social groups and intergroup contexts</title><p>Previous studies of in-group contact norms have focused primarily on normative effects among majority groups, thus neglecting how minority groups perceive and react to such norms. However, intergroup contact research has shown that the relationship between contact and intergroup attitudes depends on the social status of the group; the contact-attitude link is typically weaker for minority members [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It may be, as Tropp and Pettigrew [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] pointed out, that optimal contact conditions, including normative support for intergroup interactions, are perceived and their influence is exercised differently across the groups. Few studies that examined status differences in the effects of contact norms have produced mixed results.</p><p>First, some findings suggested that although majority and minority groups differ in their perception of contact norms, whereby minority perceives them to be less positive than the majority, their effects on intergroup outcomes are largely the same in both groups. For instance, Schachner et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that early adolescent immigrants in Germany perceived less support for intergroup contact and cooperation within their schools than their non-immigrant peers. However, there were no status differences in the strength of the association between school contact norms and intentions to socialise with the outgroup. Likewise, Gomez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found equally strong effects of perceived in-group norms on intergroup attitudes and expectations for future contact among Spanish majority and immigrant minority adolescents.</p><p>Second, there are studies showing differences between majority and majority youth with respect to the effects of different types of perceived contact norms. For example, a longitudinal study among German and Turkish preadolescents attending ethnically heterogeneous schools showed that although perceived peer norms about cross-ethnic friendships predicted preference for the same-ethnic friendships over time in both groups, the effects of peer norms were particularly strong for the majority [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, Feddes, Noack and Rutland [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] found that peer norms about intergroup friendships partially mediate the relationship between direct contact and outgroup evaluations only among ethnic majority children. Finally, Tropp et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] provided both cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence of different patterns of peer and school norm effects among majority and minority adolescents in two different majority-minority contexts. However, majority-minority differences in the effect of parental norms have not yet been studied.</p><p>In addition, previous research on intergroup contact norms has mainly neglected the role of wider social context in which these norms operate, thus raising issues of ecological validity. Group norms are context dependent and influenced by specific in-group and intergroup dynamics of the groups involved [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. According to the social identity perspective, an important contextual factor influencing social identities is the presence of intergroup conflict. Intergroup conflict is likely to make social identities contextually salient and heighten individual&#x02019;s identification with the in-group [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In turn, stronger identification with a contextually relevant in-group enhances adherence to in-group norms [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In line with this rationale, it can be assumed that intergroup behaviours of in-group members will be more strongly influenced by in-group norms in contexts with a more recent or intense history of intergroup conflict than in those with relatively harmonious relations between the majority and minority. However, to our knowledge, only two previous studies have explored the effects of intergroup contact norms in two different intergroup contexts [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and even those have used different norm measures across contexts, making contextual comparisons of normative influences difficult, if not impossible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>The present research</title><p>The studies so far indicate that in-group norms about contact with the outgroup have an important role in determining a range of intergroup outcomes. However, these norms have been operationalised inconsistently and not comprehensively. For example, most studies did not consider several important sources of normative influence for adolescents separately. Some have combined items involving different sources of normative influence (e.g. best friends, friends, family, school, larger society, whole in-group) into a single measure [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], making it difficult to evaluate the unique effects of norms coming from specific reference groups. Others sought to assess the normative effects of a single reference group such as in-group friends [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], classmates [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], parents [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and school authorities [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or have differentiated the effects of up to two sources of influence [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Given that adolescents are often exposed to different, even conflicting norms simultaneously, it is important to determine sources of normative influence which are most likely to affect their intergroup attitudes and behaviours. However, to our knowledge, no research has simultaneously tested relative effects of norms conveyed by peers, parents and schools. Moreover, although some authors hypothesise that the pressure to conform to norms of specific reference groups changes with age of the adolescent, age differences in the strength of different types of normative influences are still unclear. Finally, research of in-group contact norms among majority and minority groups, and in different intergroup contexts has been limited. It is crucial to examine the norms about contact in diverse social groups and environments because members of majority and minority groups may differ in the way they perceive and react to contact norms and because different intergroup contexts may alter the way these norms shape majority-minority dynamics.</p><p>In order to address challenges we have pointed out, we conducted a study among majority and minority adolescents in four different intergroup contexts in the Republic of Croatia. In each context we focused on Croats as the majority group and a specific minority group which exercises the right to education in its mother tongue due to its high representation in the local population. These minority groups are Serbs, Hungarians, Czechs and Italians. These four groups practise the schooling of their children completely in their minority language. This practice (i.e. separate schools for minority students or separate minority classes within the same school as majority students) was a criterion for the selection of participants in the study. Besides these shared educational practices regulated as a minority educational right in the Republic of Croatia, the four majority-minority groups differ in their histories and in their current dynamics of intergroup relations.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Social context of the study</title><p>The Croatian-Serbian context includes the city of Vukovar and its surroundings, located in the Vukovar-Sirmium County in which Croats make up 79.2%, Serbs 15.5%, and other minorities 5.3% of the total population. These are post-conflict communities with a strong ethnic division between Croats and Serbs due to recent war in the 1990s. During the 1991&#x02013;1995 war Vukovar suffered massive destruction and victimisation, and today also faces severe impoverishment and high unemployment rate [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Although Croatian and Serbian language, as well as many cultural traditions, are very similar, this intergroup context is considered as being ethnically divided, with only superficial contacts between the groups, and palpable interethnic tensions [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The Croatian-Hungarian context encompasses the Osijek-Baranja County with 85.9% Croats, 2.7% of Hungarians and 11.4% of other minorities. The Hungarian minority lives mostly in small, relatively ethnically homogenous villages, slightly separated from the Croatian majority. Hungarians and Croats lived in the same state for about 800 years, first in the unified kingdom and then within the Habsburg Empire and the last and only open conflict dated back to 1848. Though interethnic relations of Croats and Hungarians varied throughout history, they have been relatively positive and peaceful for a long time. However, some stereotypes related to historical antagonism and social distance between Croats and Hungarians still exist in Croatian society [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The Croatian-Czech context refers to the city of Daruvar and its surroundings located in Bjelovar-Bilogora County (84.8% Croats, 5.3% Czechs and 9.9% of other minorities). Czech minority has been present in this region for more than 150 years. They settled in Croatia during the 18th and 19th century when both Croatian and Czech territories were part of the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The Czechs and Croats have never had a history of intergroup conflict and their mutual relations in this region can be described as mostly harmonious. Due to their high level of integration in the local community, Czechs in this region even speak a unique form of the Czech idiom which is strongly influenced by Croatian language.</p><p>Finally, the Croatian-Italian context includes the Istria County (68.3% Croats, 6.0% Italians and 25.7% of other minorities), as one of the most ethnically mixed regions in Croatia. The history of conflict between Croats and Italians dated back after World War I, when almost all of the Istrian peninsula was annexed by Italy and exposed to forced Italianisation. After World War II, Istria was returned to the Croatian territory (under the jurisdiction of former Yugoslavia), and a significant percentage of Italians in Istria were forced to leave. Since that time the two groups have largely managed to develop mostly positive intergroup relations and a strong sense of regional identity. The rights of Italian minority are even protected by the Statute of the Istrian County which supports bilingualism and multicultural and multi-ethnic features of Istria.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The purpose of the research was to examine the effects of three types of contact norms (peer, parental and school) on a variety of intergroup attitudes (in-group bias, social distance) and behavioural tendencies (tendency towards outgroup discrimination, prosocial behaviour towards the outgroup). We also wanted to test for moderating effects of adolescent&#x02019;s age, social status and intergroup context in the strength of these effects. We predicted that all three types of norms will be related to all intergroup outcomes. More specifically we predicted that perception of more positive peer, parental and school norms about the contact with the outgroup will predict lower levels of intergroup bias, social distance and tendency to discriminate the outgroup, and higher levels of prosocial behaviour towards the outgroup. In line with more recent findings on the age-related changes in the peer and parental normative pressures, we predicted that the effects of peer contact norms on intergroup attitudes and behaviours will diminish with adolescent&#x02019;s age, while the effects of parental norms will not be moderated by age. Due to the previous mixed findings regarding the role of group status as a potential moderator of these associations, we did not make any direct hypothesis about strength of normative effects among majority and minority adolescents. However, because norm adherence strengthens in conflictual settings, we expected stronger effects of contact norms on outgroup attitudes and behaviours in contexts with a more recent history of intergroup conflict.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Procedure and participants</title><p>Data collection was carried out during spring and autumn of 2017 in four intergroup contexts where minority children attend schools in their mother tongue. All research procedures were approved by the institutional review board at the Department of Psychology, University of Zagreb. Participants were recruited with the help of school staff in 21 elementary (4 with majority, 7 with minority and 10 with both majority and minority language of instruction) and 10 high schools (4 with majority, 3 with minority and 3 with both majority and minority language of instruction). In most schools, we recruited students attending either 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> grade of elementary or 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> grade of high school, except for a few schools in which we also recruited students from 8<sup>th</sup> grade of elementary or 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> grade of high school to compensate for the lack of minority students in the sample. Only students with written parental consent (for children under 14 years) or student assent were included in the sample. The research team administered questionnaires during one class period (45 min). The questionnaires for all minority participants, except the Czech (who preferred to fill out the questionnaire in Croatian language), were translated into their mother tongue by a professional translator and with supervision of psychologists who were fluent in the respective minority language.

Based on the content analysis of 26 focus group discussions with majority and minority students, 15 items describing adolescents&#x02019; perceptions of contact norms were formulated. Participants assessed if they agree with each item on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 4 (completely agree), with higher values indicating more positive norms about intergroup contact.</p><p>Confirmatory factor analysis using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors was conducted in R lavaan package [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] to evaluate the factor structure underlying these 15 items. We expected items designed to measure peer, parental and school contact norms to load onto their respective latent factors (5 items on each type of norm). To assess the overall model fit, we used the Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square test (S-B &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>), the comparative fit index (CFI), the root mean square of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR). In line with literature recommendations, non-significant S-B &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (although significant values are acceptable when the sample size is large), CFI &#x02265; .95, SRMR &#x02264; .08, and RMSEA &#x02264; .06 were considered indicative of a good model fit [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The three-factor model including all 15 items produced a poor fit (S-B &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (87, N = 1175) = 798.185, p &#x0003c; .001; CFI = .82; RMSEA = .08; SRMR = .08). In the next step, we revised the model iteratively by removing items with low factor loadings and/or problematic wording one at a time, until a satisfactory model fit was achieved (S-B &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (11, N = 1284) = 80.052, p &#x0003c; .001; CFI = .97; RMSEA = .07; SRMR = .04). This model included two items measuring peer norms (&#x0201c;My friends usually go out with peers of Croatian/Serbian/Hungarian/ Czech/Italian nationality&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Romantic relationships between my peers of Croatian/Serbian/ Hungarian/Czech/Italian nationality are common&#x0201d;), two items measuring parental norms (&#x0201c;My parents hang out with individuals of Croatian/Serbian/Hungarian/Czech/Italian nationality&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;My parents have close friends of Croatian/Serbian/Hungarian/Czech/Italian nationality&#x0201d;) and three items measuring school norms regarding intergroup contact (&#x0201c;In my school it is common that students of Croatian/Serbian/Hungarian/Czech/Italian nationality hang out with each other&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;In my school all students are included in different activities, regardless of their nationality&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Our teachers encourage us to socialise with our peers of Croatian/Serbian/Hungarian/Czech/Italian nationality&#x0201d;). Standardised factor saturations of the seven items ranged from .50 to .86.</p><p>Cronbach's alphas on the total sample was .60 for the peer norms subscale (.66 for majority subsample, .46 for minority subsample, .60 for Croatian-Serbian and Croatian-Hungarian subsample, .52 for Croatian-Czech subsample, and 0.49 for Croatian-Italian subsample), .86 for the parental norms subscale (.89 for majority subsample, 0.78 for minority subsample, .87 for Croatian-Serbian and Croatian-Hungarian subsample and .82 for Croatian-Czech, and Croatian-Italian subsample), and .64 for the school norms subscale (.61 for majority subsample, .67 for minority subsample, .68 for Croatian-Serbian subsample, .55 for Croatian-Hungarian subsample, .54 for Croatian-Czech subsample, and .50 for Croatian-Italian subsample). Although Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas for peer and school norms subscale are relatively low and vary across different subsamples, it should be noted that these two subscales consist of only two or three items, their Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas are calculated in subsamples of different sizes and heterogeneity (e.g. minority subsamples have lower variability of total scores on the peer norm subscale than majority subsamples) and their total scores are non-normally distributed. Given that Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha is strongly affected by the length of the scale (the more items in a scale the higher the reliability), depends on the sample being tested (the more heterogenous the sample, the larger the variance of the total scores and the higher the reliability) [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and is sensitive to even minor deviations from normality [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], we deemed the reported coefficient alphas as adequate for the purpose of the research. In addition, Cronbach's alpha also depends on the content homogeneity of the items and the construct that is being assessed, and even unidimensional constructs can be conceptualised as having a number of different aspects [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The items on all norm subscales were formulated in a way that captures all relevant normative aspects that were identified during the qualitative study. However, factor analysis of the items in the quantitative study resulted in three subscales with different degree of content heterogeneity between the items. Specifically, parental norm subscale consists of two items with highly similar content (associated with parents&#x02019; close friendships and less intimate contacts) which resulted in higher reliability estimates than for peer and school norm subscales whose items tap into somewhat different normative aspects (e.g. frequency of contact and romantic relationships between members of different groups).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Tendency to discriminate against the outgroup</title><p>The tendency to discriminate against the outgroup was measured with the adapted version of tendency towards outgroup discrimination scale [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

The scale consists of five items describing different situations in which the members of one&#x02019;s own group behave negatively towards the outgroup members (e.g. &#x0201c;When my peers insult students of Croatian/Serbian/Hungarian/Czech/Italian nationality&#x0201d;), where participants have to choose one response that best describes their reaction in a given situation (1 - &#x0201c;I support them or join them&#x0201d;, 2 - &#x0201c;I pretend not to notice/I ignore them&#x0201d;, 3 - &#x0201c;I ask them to stop&#x0201d;, 4 - &#x0201c;I ask my peers to help me stop it&#x0201d;). The total score is expressed as the mean of all item scores, with higher results indicating more prosocial behaviour towards the outgroup member.

Results of the nonparametric test indicated that there is no sufficient evidence to reject the assumption of data missing completely at random (<italic>T</italic> = 8.192, <italic>p</italic> = .570). According to guidelines for handling missing data [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], if the data are consistent with the assumption of missing completely at random and the remaining sample after listwise deletion is large enough for adequate power (<italic>N</italic> &#x02265; 1000), then analysis can be performed on a complete sample containing no missing data.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Descriptive statistics of the study variables</title><p><xref rid="pone.0227512.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents means and standard deviations of all study variables for the total sample, majority and minority subsamples regardless of the context and subsamples from each of the four contexts regardless of participant&#x02019;s group status.

Because age is a continuous predictor, the first moderation analysis was conducted through a path model which included mean centred norm predictors and age, as well as their interaction terms. Significant interactions terms were followed by a comparison of simple slopes to allow for the interpretation of the interaction effect. This model was also fully saturated, so we do not report fit index values. The moderating role of group status and intergroup context were analysed using separate multiple-group path analyses which allow for comparisons of regression coefficients across groups defined by a categorical moderator. Because we initially assumed that the groups might display different normative effects, we first assessed the overall moderation effect by comparing the fit of two nested models: an unconstrained model in which all regression paths were allowed to vary across the groups and a constrained model where all paths were set to be equal between the groups. Due to violation of the multivariate normality assumption, the models&#x02019; goodness of fit was assessed based on the Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-squared statistic (S-B &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) and these two models were compared using a scaled Satorra-Bentler chi-square difference test (&#x00394;S-B &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> with an &#x003b1;-level of .05) because the use of S-B &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> as a measure of fit also requires an adjustment to the chi-square difference test [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] If the test was significant, we next identified specific paths that differ between the groups by estimating a series of models in which we systematically constrained each regression path, one at a time, to be equal across the groups. If constraining a path resulted in a significant decrease in the model fit compared to the unconstrained model, this path was allowed to vary between the groups in the final model. This process enabled us to establish a partially constrained model specifying all paths that do and do not differ significantly across the groups.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Moderation effects of age</title><p>Moderated path analysis for age revealed significant negative effects of peer (<italic>b</italic> = -0.58, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.13, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001) and parental norms (<italic>b</italic> = -0.91, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001) on in-group bias.

The constrained version of the model in which normative path coefficients were set to be equal among participants from the Croatian-Serbian, Croatian-Hungarian, Croatian-Czech and Croatian-Italian context had significantly worse fit than the unconstrained model (&#x00394;&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(36) = 73.754, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001), indicating that intergroup context has an overall moderation effect.

The hypothesis predicting stronger normative effects on intergroup outcomes in post-conflict context was partially supported given that the significant difference between the Croatian-Serbian context and all other intergroup contexts were found only in the relation between parental norms about intergroup contact and two different negative intergroup outcomes (discrimination tendencies and social distance).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this research was to examine the relative effects of peer, parental and school norms about intergroup contact on positive and negative indicators of intergroup relations in a diverse sample of majority and minority adolescents of various ages living in four different majority-minority contexts. In an attempt to extend previous findings and determine boundary conditions under which normative effects are attenuated, we also tested for potential age, social status and contextual differences in the strength of normative effects.</p><p>We predicted that positive perception of all three types of norms will be negatively related to in-group bias, social distance and tendency to discriminate the outgroup, and positively related to outgroup prosocial behaviour. In support of our hypothesis, all three types of norms significantly predicted lower levels of discrimination tendencies and higher levels of prosocial behaviour towards the outgroup among the total sample. Moreover, all three types of norms had approximately equal effects on these dependent variables. However, only peer and parental norms predicted lower in-group bias and social distance towards the outgroup. These results are in line with previous research showing that peer groups [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], family members [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and school environments [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], when examined separately, all play important roles in adolescents&#x02019; interethnic relations. However, our results extend previous findings by demonstrating independent effects of different types of norms in the prediction of intergroup attitudes and behaviours. Moreover, the fact that we found significant normative effects in the sample of majority and minority adolescents attending separate schools or separate classes within the same school emphasises the importance of positive contact norms in contexts which limit the opportunity for direct intergroup contact. This seems to suggest that mere perception that one&#x02019;s peers, parents and school authorities have or approve intergroup contact can benefit adolescents&#x02019; intergroup relations even if they themselves have reduced possibilities of experiencing meaningful contact with outgroup members within the school.</p><p>Our findings are also consistent with studies indicating differential effects of peer and school norms. For example, Tropp et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and McKeown and Taylor [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found peer norms to be a more consistent predictor of adolescents&#x02019; contact experiences and intergroup behaviours than school norms. In our study, school norms did not predict attitudinal measures of bias towards one&#x02019;s own group and distance from the outgroup. However, they did predict outcomes that show more behavioural tendencies, both positive (prosocial behaviour) and negative (tendency toward discrimination). Although there isn&#x02019;t much research examining the differential impact of school norms on attitudinal and behavioural intergroup outcomes, it might be that schools, through implementation of regulations and rules regarding appropriate and undesirable conduct, might be more influential on students&#x02019; behavioural intentions and actual (or at least self-presentational) behaviour than of less observable attitudinal outcomes. If this is true, school norms, as the type of norm most amenable to change by external factors, could be used to prevent negative and promote desirable intergroup behaviours, even when minority and majority students are physically separated within their school environment. For example, in schools with different majority and minority classes, school staff could send direct and indirect messages about the desirability of intergroup contact by modelling positive intergroup interactions, organising shared intergroup activities, as well as by sanctioning intergroup conflicts. Similarly, exclusive majority and minority schools could encourage mutual cooperation through participation in joint projects and activities within the wider local community. However, one may wonder if the effect of school norms about intergroup contact would be equally robust if measures of prosocial and discriminatory behaviours contained more items describing situations outside the school context. Hence, further research could include measures that will enable to test if school norms about contact are behavioural guidance for school behaviours only or they also, once adopted, efficiently guide interethnic behaviour of adolescents in the out-of-school contexts.</p><p>Regarding the role of potential moderator variables, we expected stronger effects of perceived peer norms among younger adolescents given that resistance to peer influence increases linearly throughout adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, we did not expect age to moderate the effect of parental norms. In a partial support of our hypothesis, age moderated the effects of peer norms in the presumed direction only on social distance but did not have an effect on the relation between peer norms and any other dependent variable. More research is thus needed to examine why all intergroup outcomes do not follow the same age trend related to the effects of peer norms. As expected, parental norms had stable effects on all adolescents&#x02019; intergroup outcomes regardless of their age. Although we did not examine age-related changes in the effects of peer and parental norms, our comparison of normative effects among adolescents of different ages supports longitudinal findings indicating that parents influence their children&#x02019;s attitudes throughout their adolescence, while peers have more impact on early adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>This research has also explored whether the patterns of normative effects are similar or different for ethnic majority and minority adolescents, given prior mixed results on the role of group status as a potential moderator of these effects. Group status was a significant moderator in the relation between peer norms and prosocial behaviour, as well as in the relation between all three types of norms and social distance. Specifically, positive peer norms significantly predicted prosocial behaviour, and positive school norms predicted lower social distance only among ethnic minority adolescents. By contrast, positive peer and parental norms more strongly predicted lower social distance among majority, than among minority adolescents. Normative effects on other intergroup outcomes did not depend on group status. Our finding of stronger peer normative effects on social distance in the sample of majority adolescents complements previous studies indicating that perceived peer norms supporting intergroup contact are more strongly related to preferences for cross-ethnic friendships and comfort with out-group members among ethnic majority students [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, our study shows that not only peer, but also parental norms have more impact on the majorities&#x02019; acceptance of close relationships with members of the minority than vice versa. However, the effect of school norms on social distance in our study was significant only for minority students. These results are in line with previous research corroborating differences in the importance of peer and school norms for ethnic majority and minority groups. For example, Tropp et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found that peer norms more strongly predict comfort with the outgroup among majority adolescents, while school norms more strongly predict the number of cross-ethnic friends among the minority. Thus, it seems that majority adolescents, when deciding whether to have close relationships with the outgroup, rely more on proximal sources of normative influence, such as peers and parents, while minority adolescents depend more on norms they perceive in their broader, school environment. It may be, as Tropp et al. [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have suggested, that formal school authorities are more influential on minority students&#x02019; intergroup relations due to their lower social status and generally less positive intergroup experiences.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first research showing majority-minority differences in peer influences on positive, prosocial behaviours. Although more research is needed to explain these findings, it may be that minority adolescents&#x02019; awareness of their lower social status makes them more sensitive to environmental messages concerning behaviours which could improve their relations with the majority. For instance, Guinote, Cotzia, Sandhu and Siwa [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] have shown that low status individuals, compared to their higher status counterparts, exhibit more prosocial behaviour and associated goals and values. The authors interpreted this tendency as a way to increase their social status and to regulate social interactions with individuals of higher status. If intergroup prosocial behaviour is valued more among minority groups, it should also be strongly regulated by in-group norms supporting positive relations with the outgroup. Given that our measure of prosocial behaviour captures prosocial tendencies in the context of peer interactions, it is therefore not surprising that we found status differences in the effects of only peer norms. However, it would be interesting to further investigate if different types of in-group norms regarding contact with the outgroup have significant effects on a wider range of positive intergroup behaviours among minority adolescents.</p><p>Finally, this is the first research examining potential contextual moderation of normative effects in a single study with the assumption that norms will generally have stronger effects in intergroup contexts with history of a recent intergroup conflict. In a support of our hypothesis, we found that parental norms were associated with lower discrimination tendencies only among adolescents living in ethnically divided, post-conflict communities in the Croatian-Serbian context. Additionally, parental normative influences on social distance were stronger in this post-conflict context compared to all other, relatively harmonious intergroup contexts. These findings offer support for the view that in-group norms are likely to be most influential when in-group identification is increased as a result of intergroup conflict [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Moreover, our findings seem to suggest that adolescents living in such contexts may be especially attuned to parental normative influences, when deciding whether to act negatively (i. e. to discriminate or distance themselves from the outgroup) towards members of the outgroup. Nonetheless, we did not take degree of ethnic identification into account as an antecedent of stronger normative effects in post-conflict communities, so further research is needed to specify the factors contributing to the heightened effects of specific types of norms in such environments.</p><p>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that although all three types of norms can play an important role in adolescents&#x02019; intergroup attitudes and behaviours, their relative importance seems to vary depending on the specific type of intergroup outcome, social status of the groups involved, the type of intergroup contexts in which these norms operate, and sometimes even the age of the normative target. However, there are some limitations to this study that need to be acknowledged.</p><p>First, while the overall sample size, as well as the size of status and contextual subsamples was quite large, we did not have enough minority and majority adolescents from each intergroup context to differentiate between them in multi-group analyses. Therefore, we cannot claim that majority-minority differences in the strength of normative influences obtained on aggregate samples of minority and majority adolescents would be replicated in each intergroup context. In addition, it is possible that the comparison of majorities (or minorities) from different multi-ethnic communities would reveal additional contextual differences that were concealed by contextually comparing all adolescents, regardless of their status.</p><p>Second, the relations between different types of norms and intergroup outcomes were only examined cross-sectionally, which limits our understanding of causal, as well as long-term effects of norms about intergroup contact. Longitudinal research is thus needed to test whether the same normative effects would be obtained over time. In addition, longitudinal research including more than two time points could provide more in-depth insight into age-related changes in the effects of different types of norms. Nevertheless, cross-sectional research can be useful in order to determine boundary conditions where established relationships between the variables of interest are attenuated [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], which is exactly what we have done through the use of moderator tests.</p><p>The third limitation concerns the relatively low and variable internal reliabilities of peer and school norms subscales across different status and contextual subsamples which could have impaired their predictive validity. However, this may suggest that the effects of normative variables in the current study might be even stronger than reported. Future research should therefore modify the current measure of normative influences, by increasing the number of items on each subscale.</p><p>Finally, peer, parental and school norms about intergroup contact have been assessed using explicit reports of participant&#x02019;s perceptions of norms which some authors claim to be susceptible to various individual biases [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Future research could benefit from including more implicit measures of normative influences, such as measures of peer, parental or teacher attitudes towards intergroup interactions or even self-reported number of intergroup friendships. However, some authors have argued that individuals&#x02019; perception of norms within their community may not match the actual attitudes or behaviours of community members, and that these subjective perceptions may have even more influence on individual&#x02019;s subsequent attitudes and behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0227512.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>Despite the limitations, we believe that this research contributes to the existing literature on contact related normative influences, by demonstrating how different types of norms predict intergroup outcomes of ethnic minority and majority youth and by establishing the conditions under which such norms may be more or less influential on adolescents&#x02019; intergroup attitudes and behaviours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227512.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Dataset used to obtain the research results.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227512.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227512.s002"><label>S1 Questionnaire</label><caption><title>The croatian and english language version of the questionnaire.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227512.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank our collaborators on the IntegraNorm project who helped with data collection (Margareta Jeli&#x00107;, Jasmina Toma&#x00161;i&#x00107; Humer) and offered advice for data analysis (Bla&#x0017e; Rebernjak).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227512.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Allport</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name>. <source>The nature of prejudice</source>. <publisher-loc>Oxford, England</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Addison-Wesley</publisher-name>; <year>1954</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0227512.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Sherif</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sherif</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name>. <source>Groups in harmony and tension: An integration of studies of intergroup relations</source>. <publisher-loc>Oxford, England</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Harper &#x00026; Brothers</publisher-name>; <year>1953</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0227512.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Crandall</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stangor</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>Conformity and prejudice</chapter-title> In: <name><surname>Dovidio</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Glick</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rudman</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name>, editors. <source>On the nature of prejudice: Fifty years after Allport</source>. <publisher-loc>Malden, MA</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</publisher-name>; <year>2005</year> pp. <fpage>295</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>309</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0227512.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Pettigrew</surname><given-names>TF</given-names></name>. <article-title>Regional differences in anti-Negro prejudice</article-title>. <source>J Abnorm Soc Psychol</source>. <year>1959</year>;<volume>59</volume>: <fpage>28</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>36</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1037/h0047133</pub-id>

</p><p>PONE-D-19-16051</p><p>Normative approach to intergroup relations: The role of peer, parental and school norms about intergroup contact in predicting adolescents&#x02019; interethnic attitudes and behaviours</p><p>Dear Dr. Pehar,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>I was unable to obtain any external reviews for your paper and so in the interests of moving your submission along, I have read it myself and have some suggestions for a revision before it can accepted for Plos One. Your paper presents the findings from a survey conducted in 21 elementary and 10 high schools in Croatia focusing on the relations of peer, parental, and school norms with four intergroup outcomes: in-group bias, discrimination, prosocial behavior, and social distance. The literature review identified several questions for which previous research has either been contradictory or lacking. You collected data from both majority and minority youth in the Croatian context with the difference between Croatian and Serbian youth being the most contentious due to the experience of the civil war in the 1990&#x02019;s. You also collected data in other contexts in which the minority group had better relations with the Croatian majority. Thus, you planned to test differences in the relations between the three types of norms and each outcome depending on differences between majority and minority youth, age, and conflict history. </p><p>The very first question one would raise about the study is the very uneven representation of the various intergroup comparisons in the Table on page 15. I would be skeptical of any ability to study age by context interactions given the very small representation in the Hungarian context and the very uneven age representation in the Czech context. This is the case even before you drop nearly 25% of the sample due to incomplete responses. I would recommend only looking at the Serbian and Italian contexts since they have the largest and most balanced representation of age and minority-majority group status. The other option would be to collapse the various non-Serbian contexts into one, but this would also raise questions about whether this is appropriate given your description of the histories of these groups. </p><p>The second concern is the large variation in the alphas on page 17 for the peer norm and school norm scales for the minority youth. This may affect your conclusions in unknown ways and thus throws your findings regarding differences between the groups into doubt. Perhaps if you drop some of the smaller groups, this will help raise the alphas? As you know, the lower the reliability of a predictor, the less well it will predict outcomes. </p><p>My final concern is the way you show the results. The path diagrams are hard to read (and some are not labelled), and they are inadequate as a description of the findings, especially for interactions. I would encourage you to plot the various significant outcomes of interest in easy to digest graphical format so one can see what the moderation differences look like. It is easy to obtain moderation effects when there are floor or ceiling effects that make the slopes look different, but these may not be very interesting in themselves. So, a reader would want to see the slopes for all three of your interaction predictions whether they are significant or not. </p><p>Finally, I would substantiate that it is acceptable to test for differences between models using the chi-square test associated with robust estimation. I would also provide a stronger rationale for not imputing data for those missing scores. This is an accepted practice if the missingness is sufficiently related to predictors in the dataset. You suggest that this is not the case, but more specific evidence to that effect would be more convincing. You are losing a large proportion of your data, and the dataset is not that large to begin with especially if you drop the two contexts as suggested above.</p><p>**********</p><p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by 15 August.

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">29 Nov 2019</named-content>
</p><p>Thank you for your review and the opportunity to revise our manuscript &#x0201e;Normative approach to intergroup relations: The role of peer, parental and school norms about intergroup contact in predicting adolescents&#x02019; interethnic attitudes and behaviours &#x0201c;. We appreciate the time and effort that you have dedicated to providing valuable feedback on our manuscript and are grateful for your insightful suggestions. We have been able to incorporate changes to reflect most of your suggestions, except the one regarding the proposed sample changes due to reasons we explain in more detail later. The changes were highlighted in the revised manuscript using track changes, as you requested. </p><p>Here is a point-by-point response to your comments and concerns. </p><p>Comment 1: The very first question one would raise about the study is the very uneven representation of the various intergroup comparisons in the Table on page 15. I would be skeptical of any ability to study age by context interactions given the very small representation in the Hungarian context and the very uneven age representation in the Czech context. This is the case even before you drop nearly 25% of the sample due to incomplete responses. I would recommend only looking at the Serbian and Italian contexts since they have the largest and most balanced representation of age and minority-majority group status. The other option would be to collapse the various non-Serbian contexts into one, but this would also raise questions about whether this is appropriate given your description of the histories of these groups.</p><p>Response: We agree that studying age by context interactions in this particular sample is difficult due to uneven age representation in specific contexts. However, we think that dropping Czech and Hungarian contexts would lead to substantial loss of important information, as well as to reduced possibility to generalise our findings on context differences related to conflict history to other harmonious intergroup contexts. Also, as you have already pointed out, collapsing all non-Serbian contexts into one would neglect significant differences in histories of intergroup relations between these groups. In order to address the issue that you have pointed out, we decided to avoid all age by context and age by status interactions in moderation analyses because these interactions were never central to our research questions (we are interested in status and contextual differences in the strength of normative effects on intergroup outcomes, not in the strength of age effects). In previous multi-group path analyses for group status and context, we included age as a covariate due to its significant interaction effect with peer norms on social distance, but now we have conducted the multigroup path analyses again without age as a covariate. Changes in the text which reflect differences in results between previous and new analyses are highlighted in sections Moderation effect of group status (lines 643 to 734 in the revised manuscript with tracked changes) and Moderation effects of intergroup context (lines 739 to 805 in the revised manuscript). </p><p>Comment 2: The second concern is the large variation in the alphas on page 17 for the peer norm and school norm scales for the minority youth. This may affect your conclusions in unknown ways and thus throws your findings regarding differences between the groups into doubt. Perhaps if you drop some of the smaller groups, this will help raise the alphas? As you know, the lower the reliability of a predictor, the less well it will predict outcomes.</p><p>Response: You have raised an important issue here and we are aware that reliability of a predictor reflects on its possibility to predict the outcome variables. However, due to reasons described in the previous response, we are reluctant to drop some of the smaller groups, especially because we think that doing so would not fix the problem of small and varying reliabilities (e.g. in minority subsample from Croatian-Italian context the reliability of the peer norm subscale is .32 and the reliability of the school norm subscale is .54). Instead, we would like to point out that Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, as a measure of reliability, is strongly affected by the length of the scale (the more items in a scale the higher the reliability), depends on the sample being tested (the more heterogenous the sample, the larger the variance of the total scores and the higher the reliability) and is sensitive to even minor deviations from normality which are all potential explanations why Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas for the peer and school norms subscales in some of our subsamples are low. In addition, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha also depends on the content homogeneity of the items and the construct that is being assessed. The items on all our norm subscales were formulated in a way that captures all relevant normative aspects that were identified during the qualitative study. However, factor analysis of the items in the quantitative study resulted in three subscales with different degree of content heterogeneity between the items (parental norm subscale consists of two items with highly similar content, while peer and school norm contain items that tap into somewhat different normative aspects). We explained these potential reasons for low and variable reliabilities in the revised manuscript with tracked changes (lines 387 to 407). Furthermore, we underlined the problem of low and variable reliabilities of our norm subscales in the discussion section of the revised manuscript and have suggested their improvement in future research (lines 937 to 942). </p><p>In addition, we estimated that the way that we have reported Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas for all study variables in the original manuscript (specifying the range of alphas for majority and minority subsamples from different intergroup contexts) is not relevant for group comparisons that we have presented in our paper. Therefore, in our revised manuscript we have reported Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas calculated on separate subsamples of minority and majority participants, as well as subsamples of participants from each intergroup context (lines 378 to 380 for peer norms subscale, 380-382 for parental norms subscale, 385-387 for school norms subscale, 419-421 for tendency towards outgroup discrimination scale, 435-437 for prosocial behaviour scale and lines 448 to 450 for social distance scale). </p><p>Comment 3: My final concern is the way you show the results. The path diagrams are hard to read (and some are not labelled), and they are inadequate as a description of the findings, especially for interactions. I would encourage you to plot the various significant outcomes of interest in easy to digest graphical format so one can see what the moderation differences look like. It is easy to obtain moderation effects when there are floor or ceiling effects that make the slopes look different, but these may not be very interesting in themselves. So, a reader would want to see the slopes for all three of your interaction predictions whether they are significant or not.</p><p>Response: Thank you for reminding us of how important it is to present the results in a clear and easily interpretable way. We kept only the path diagram for the results on the total sample because we believe that it is relevant and readable and have deleted all figure captions relating to subsequent moderation path diagrams in our revised manuscript. As you suggested, we have presented all of our significant interactions between norm and moderator variables in corresponding interaction plot figures which depict the slopes of predictor variables at different levels of moderator variables and have inserted their figure captions in the revised manuscript (interaction plot figures were submitted as supporting information). We did not graphically present insignificant interactions because we considered that including 36 different interaction plots would overload an already lengthy manuscript. However, if you feel that this is necessary, we will of course include them after the second review. </p><p>Comment 4: Finally, I would substantiate that it is acceptable to test for differences between models using the chi-square test associated with robust estimation.</p><p>Response: Thank you for pointing this out. Testing differences between path models with different number of constrained and freed parameters using chi-square difference test is a common way of testing moderation effects in SEM framework. However, when each path model is estimated using Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square test due to violation of the multivariate normality assumption, the chi-square difference test also needs to be adjusted for the scaling correction. We have substantiated that this is an acceptable procedure with appropriate literature reference (lines 595 to 600 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Comment 5: I would also provide a stronger rationale for not imputing data for those missing scores. This is an accepted practice if the missingness is sufficiently related to predictors in the dataset. You suggest that this is not the case, but more specific evidence to that effect would be more convincing. You are losing a large proportion of your data, and the dataset is not that large to begin with especially if you drop the two contexts as suggested above.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We have done a thorough analysis of missing data patterns and found no systematic pattern of nonresponses across the study variables. Specifically, 205 respondents had a missing value on only one of the study variables (59 respondents on social distance, 36 on peer norms, 29 on school norms, 27 on discrimination tendencies, 23 on prosocial behaviour, 20 on parental norms and 11 on ingroup bias), while 129 respondents had some pattern of missing data involving two or more variables. From those, the only unique pattern of missing data found in more than 10 respondents was the one with omitted responses on four variables at the end of the questionnaire and that pattern was found for only 17 respondents. In order to determine whether these data were missing completely at random, we examined if the missing data on criterion variables are related to observed values of predictor variables using R package finalfit. Comparisons of cases with incomplete and complete data on discrimination tendencies variable revealed no significant differences in mean values of peer (p = 0.907), parental (p = .125), and school norms (p = .161) variables. Comparisons on prosocial behaviour variable revealed no significant differences in mean values of peer (p = 0.518), parental (p = .976), and school norms (p = .799) variables. Comparisons on in-group bias variable revealed no significant differences in mean values of peer (p = 0.699), parental (p = .216), and school norms (p = .152) variables. Finally, comparisons on social distance variable also revealed no significant differences in mean values of peer (p = 0.100), parental (p = .132), and school norms (p = .255) variables, showing that the probability of missing data on dependent variables is unrelated to the predictor variables. In addition, we performed the nonparametric test of homoscedasticity developed by Jamshidian and Jalal using R package MissMech. This test examines whether non-normally distributed data has values missing completely at random by testing for homogeneity of covariances between subsets of data having different patterns of missingness (including the one with no missing values). Results of the nonparametric test indicated that there is no sufficient evidence to reject the assumption of data missing completely at random (T = 8.192, p = 0.570).

</p><p>PONE-D-19-16051R1</p><p>Normative approach to intergroup relations: The role of peer, parental and school norms about intergroup contact in predicting adolescents' interethnic attitudes and behaviours</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Pehar,</p><p>Thank you for responding to the concerns raised in the first review. I now mainly have suggestions for making the paper stronger and clearer.</p><p>I think your paper will have relevance to educators and others interested in trying to improve interethnic relations in countries such as Croatia. So, I wonder if you might consider a title that makes it clearer that you are studying these issues in a country that has had significant interethnic conflict, something like: The role of peer, parental, and school norms in predicting adolescents&#x02019; attitudes and behaviours for both majority and different minority ethnic groups in Croatia. I of course leave this up to you, but I think it will make the abstract a bit more interesting as well.</p><p>I also think that the types of schools you are studying will be of interest because the minority youth are segregated from the majority youth in their classes. This would seem to reduce intergroup contact and thus make it more difficult to reduce barriers between the groups. You can&#x02019;t tell if that matters, but I think it is something that might be worth noting in the discussion.</p><p>Related to this point, you seem to downplay the positive role of school norms in your results. On page 35 lines 772-773, you suggest that the significant effects of school norms are due to &#x0201c;a common method factor.&#x0201d; This is confusing because if anything the common variance shared by school norms with the other norms should make it more difficult to detect any effects of school norms. So, the fact that you got relations beyond peer and parental norms for behavioral outcomes is worth highlighting rather than downplaying. Also, this is a factor that is most amenable to intervention, and so it would be worth highlighting it in the introduction as well as the discussion. That is, is there a role for schools despite the segregation of students and the history of conflict to encourage greater intergroup acceptance?</p><p>I appreciate your discussion of the decision to use listwise deletion of cases with missing data. However, there really is no direct way to test for &#x0201c;missing completely at random&#x0201d; and so I would just report the finding that missing data were not related to your predictors and that is at least consistent with the assumption of &#x0201c;missing at random.&#x0201d; This condition is also consistent with using listwise deletion.</p><p>In several places you say that you cannot report goodness of fit because the model is saturated. But then you show results with nonsignificant paths deleted (e.g., Figure 1). But you could certainly report the goodness of fit for those results.</p><p>Finally, when describing the various ethnic groups, I would try to avoid using the essentialist descriptions whenever possible, i.e., Croats, Serbs, Czechs, Hungarians. For example, on page 15 lines 338-339, you could say &#x0201c;Croatian students responded to items&#x02026;towards their Serbian peers, and Serbian students toward their Croatian peers.&#x0201d; Making the ethnic classifications predictive rather than attributive encourages an essentialist categorization of ethnic difference, which is something you don&#x02019;t need to do.</p><p>When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter.</p><p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future.

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">19 Dec 2019</named-content>
</p><p>Here is a point-by-point response to your comments and concerns. </p><p>Comment 1: I think your paper will have relevance to educators and others interested in trying to improve interethnic relations in countries such as Croatia. So, I wonder if you might consider a title that makes it clearer that you are studying these issues in a country that has had significant interethnic conflict, something like: The role of peer, parental, and school norms in predicting adolescents&#x02019; attitudes and behaviours for both majority and different minority ethnic groups in Croatia. I of course leave this up to you, but I think it will make the abstract a bit more interesting as well.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this excellent observation, we have changed the title of our manuscript according to your proposal on first page of the manuscript (lines 4 to 5 in the revised manuscript). </p><p>Comment 2: I also think that the types of schools you are studying will be of interest because the minority youth are segregated from the majority youth in their classes. This would seem to reduce intergroup contact and thus make it more difficult to reduce barriers between the groups. You can&#x02019;t tell if that matters, but I think it is something that might be worth noting in the discussion.</p><p>Response: We agree with this and have incorporated a comment relating to specific school contexts in our study in the discussion section of the revised manuscript (lines 790 to 797).</p><p>Comment 3: Related to this point, you seem to downplay the positive role of school norms in your results. On page 35 lines 772-773, you suggest that the significant effects of school norms are due to &#x0201c;a common method factor.&#x0201d; This is confusing because if anything the common variance shared by school norms with the other norms should make it more difficult to detect any effects of school norms. So, the fact that you got relations beyond peer and parental norms for behavioural outcomes is worth highlighting rather than downplaying. Also, this is a factor that is most amenable to intervention, and so it would be worth highlighting it in the introduction as well as the discussion. That is, is there a role for schools despite the segregation of students and the history of conflict to encourage greater intergroup acceptance?</p><p>Response: We appreciate your concern regarding our explanation of the school norms effect. However, we did not want to say that the significant effect of the school norms is due to a common method factor shared by different measures of contacts norms, but instead due to common variance shared by our measure of school norms and measures of discrimination tendencies and prosocial behaviour (all three measures include items related to the school context). We rephrased this part in our revised manuscript to make it clearer, as well as to avoid the &#x0201c;common method factor&#x0201d; implications (lines 818 to 823). In addition, we agree with your observation that we did not sufficiently emphasize the positive role of school norms in our results. Accordingly, we highlighted the potential of school norms in improving intergroup relations, both in the introduction (lines 144 to 147) and the discussion section (lines 810 to 818) of the revised manuscript. </p><p>Comment 4: I appreciate your discussion of the decision to use listwise deletion of cases with missing data. However, there really is no direct way to test for &#x0201c;missing completely at random&#x0201d; and so I would just report the finding that missing data were not related to your predictors and that is at least consistent with the assumption of &#x0201c;missing at random&#x0201d;. This condition is also consistent with using listwise deletion.</p><p>Response: We agree that there is no direct way to test whether the data are missing completely at random (MCAR), but this also true for missing at random (MAR) mechanism. According to Rhoads (2012), the empirical data can never provide evidence either for or against the MAR assumption (which implies that missingness may depend on observables but cannot depend on unobservables), and the MCAR assumption (which implies that missingness cannot depend on either observables or unobservables) can be falsified by the data, but it can never be proven true (the data tells us nothing about whether missingness depends on unobservables, but it can tell us whether missingness depends on observables). In other words, MCAR processes require missing data to be MAR (which is not testable), as well as to not depend on observable data (which can be tested). Several tests of MCAR mechanism that exist in the literature (e.g. t-tests or Kruskal Wallis tests for comparison of missing data in the dependent variable across explanatory variables, Little&#x02019;s test or nonparametric test of homoscedasticity as omnibus tests of MCAR) can only test MCAR relative to MAR alternative hypothesis, while assuming that data are MAR a priori. So, while we cannot directly confirm that the data are MCAR, we can use these tests to examine the patterns of missingness and see if they depend on other observed variables. We have done two of these tests (appropriate for non-normally distributed data) and were very careful to only suggest that that there is no sufficient evidence to reject the assumption of data missing completely at random. In addition, according to the literature (e.g. Little &#x00026; Rubin, 1987; Rhoads, 2012) listwise deletion requires data to be MCAR in order to produce unbiased estimates of parameters of interest. Because of that, we decided to report in more detail the finding that missing data on criterion variables were not related to our predictors (lines 472 to 481), but also to keep the results of the nonparametric test of homoscedasticity as a proof that the assumption of MCAR cannot be rejected based on the data. </p><p>Comment 5: In several places you say that you cannot report goodness of fit because the model is saturated. But then you show results with nonsignificant paths deleted (e.g., Figure 1). But you could certainly report the goodness of fit for those results.</p><p>Response: Thank you for noticing this omission. In two of our path analyses we did estimate only the saturated model because we wanted to interpret all of the model parameters, but did not report or show graphically nonsignificant paths in order to improve the readability and visibility of our results. As the idea was to test the full saturated model, we have now added and described nonsignificant paths both in the path diagram and in the text throughout the results section. </p><p>Comment 6: Finally, when describing the various ethnic groups, I would try to avoid using the essentialist descriptions whenever possible, i.e., Croats, Serbs, Czechs, Hungarians. For example, on page 15 lines 338-339, you could say &#x0201c;Croatian students responded to items&#x02026;towards their Serbian peers, and Serbian students toward their Croatian peers.&#x0201d; Making the ethnic classifications predictive rather than attributive encourages an essentialist categorization of ethnic difference, which is something you don&#x02019;t need to do.</p><p>Response: We appreciate your concerns regarding the use of appropriate terminology relating to ethnicity and would like to substantiate that we have taken special care in the selection and use of language and ethnic labels during our research with minority participants (including ethnically respectful recruitment strategies, as well as the use of professionally translated study materials upon the request of participants). We have modified the problematic terms in part of the revised manuscript in which we refer to our study participants (lines 344 to 346). However, in the description of our study contexts we kept the &#x0201c;Croat, Serb, Hungarian, Czech and Italian&#x0201d; ethnic labels as these are consistent with data from the Croatian census of population according to ethnicity. We would also like to point out that some of our research measures (which were validated and used in previous research with ethnic minorities) include items containing such labels because they reflect the everyday communication of minority and majority groups in these contexts and are consistent with their common ethnic self-identifications.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227512.s004"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to reviewer.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227512.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0227512.r005" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227512.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Romer</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Daniel Romer</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Daniel Romer</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj005" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0227512" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
