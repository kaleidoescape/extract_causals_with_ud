Whereas &#x0201c;knowledge translation&#x0201d; in general is concerned with the conversion of research into action, &#x0201c;scaling&#x0201d; is how we optimize the magnitude, variety, equity, and sustainability of research-informed actions. Among the diverse concepts used in knowledge translation and implementation science and defined elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] such as adoption, adaptation, dissemination, spread, and sustainability, scaling is &#x0201c;often used in the context of international, national, and regional health programs&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The concept of scaling is relatively new in the health sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Scaling EBPs emerged from the World Health Organization&#x02019;s (WHO) strategic approach to strengthening reproductive health policies and programs, mainly in low- and middle-income countries where scaling up strategies were implemented in different areas of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In high-income countries, scaling of EBPs is now gaining more and more interest. Years ago, B&#x000e9;gin et al. even referred to Canada as &#x0201c;a country of perpetual pilot projects&#x0201d; because proven projects or outcomes of pilot projects are rarely moved into stable, funded programs and or transferred across jurisdictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As pointed by a family doctor and advocate for public health care in Canada, &#x0201c;it&#x02019;s time to build systems that support the implementation of large-scale change&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similar statements about the lack of scaling up of EBPs were made in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Reasons include governments&#x02019; inclination for short-term results, the lack of expertise in scaling science in high-income countries, and the fact that no one in our health care system holds that responsibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Scaling up is defined as &#x0201c;deliberate efforts to increase the impact of successfully tested health innovations so as to benefit more people and to foster policy and program development on a lasting basis&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Other variants of scaling include scaling out, deep, and down. Our view is to be inclusive of all types of, and approaches to, scaling EBPs. We believe we will learn more about scaling and its effective reporting, with an open and accepting approach to contextualized language and models. What matters most in our view are the potential benefits or impacts of scaling. And there is evidence that scaling of EBPs may promote benefits such as equitable access to quality care and prevent waste of time, resources, and energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Findings from studies assessing the impact of scaling strategies in health care need to be reported adequately so their results can facilitate their replication and be translated in policy. However, deficiencies in the quality of reporting of health research are well documented in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. According to Hoffmann et al., up to 60% of interventions in a sample of trial reports were inadequately described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A systematic review on scaling up strategies of EBPs in primary care noted vast inconsistencies in how authors reported their results, with none reporting all the needed information for assessing scalability of EBPs or the effectiveness of scaling up strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consequences of inadequate reporting include lapses of scientific integrity (e.g., failure to honor research participants&#x02019; accounts or measured data, fairness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], difficulty to judge the reliability and robustness of the results, and the relevance of the evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">To remedy this situation, the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network was created to improve the quality of publications by providing resources and training relating to the reporting of health research and by assisting in the development, dissemination, and implementation of reporting guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A reporting guideline can be defined as &#x0201c;a checklist, flow diagram, or explicit text to guide authors in reporting a specific type of research, developed using explicit methodology&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the developing science of scaling, the rare systematic reviews of scaling up EBPs commented on the poor quality of reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This may be attributed to the lack of reporting guidelines relevant to the process of scaling.</p><p id="Par8">A few reporting guidelines in the field of implementation science have been developed recently. These include the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the reporting guidelines for implementation and operational research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. StaRI is a reporting guideline for phase IV implementation studies and does not cover the core components of scaling up strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The reporting guidelines for implementation and operational research, developed by WHO, are broad and covered the field of implementation rather than specific methods or study designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The lack of a specific reporting guideline for scaling studies and the identification of several gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] has prompted the registration of the standards for reporting trials assessing the impact of scaling up strategies of EBPs (SUCCEED) with EQUATOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These gaps include (a) poor description of scaling strategies, (b) lack of mention of the type of scaling strategy (e.g., vertical, horizontal), (c) unclear distinction between the EBP and the strategies used to scale the EBP, and (d) inconsistent reporting (e.g., no information on assessing the scalability of the EBPs, lack of a clear measure of the scaling outcome). Our goal for proposing the new reporting guideline is to help address these gaps in reporting and knowledge translation related to the scaling of EBPs, including lack of assessment of potential harms, little information on sex and gender issues, and absence of patients and public engagement in designing the scaling strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts the place of scaling in the context of knowledge translation and the incremental contribution of SUCCEED reporting guideline. SUCCEED will be informed by elements addressed in existing reporting guidelines such as the clear distinction between the implementation strategies and the intervention being implemented in StaRI. Examples of items that will be specific to our reporting guideline include (a) description of the scalability assessment of the EBP in the introduction, (b) ethical and technical justification of the scaling, (c) justification of the scaling unit, (d) description of stakeholders, and (e) sex and gender considerations (objectives, measures of outcomes and effects, analyses, discussion).

In addition, the project will also contribute to the science of reporting guidelines as it will be among the first to integrate sex and gender considerations. The rationale of taking into account sex and gender in the development of the reporting guideline stems from several elements: while their importance in the manifestation and management of health conditions and in health outcomes is now getting better established, their considerations are rarely integrated in research design and reporting guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; importance of appropriate use of the terms sex and gender based on documentation that they are often misused, misunderstood, confused, or conflated in health research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], unlike other health determinants such as education, employment, and income; and fulfillment of the role of a reporting guideline that is to help reduce waste in health research by addressing the deficiency in the quality of its reporting and better inform practice, policy, and programs. Moreover, the success of implementation and scaling is highly context-dependent, particularly for complex interventions. Thus, sex and gender considerations will be integrated in the literature review and in the development of the guideline (e.g., mention of appropriate use of sex and gender, extent to which both sexes were represented in the panel group and in each trial, presentation of disaggregated data). We will include a few items in our reporting guideline, for example, (a) the stakeholders involved in the process of scaling have to be described according to their sex/gender, (b) all outcomes have to be reported by sex/gender, and (c) data analyses have to be sex/gender-based. Addressing these gaps will contribute to knowledge translation and implementation and scaling science. In turn, this should contribute to improving health outcomes and equity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par11">The aim of this project is to develop the SUCCEED, a reporting guideline for studies assessing scaling strategies.</p><p id="Par12">To accomplish this, specific objectives are follows: (1) establish an executive committee that will oversee the development process of the guideline, (2) review the literature to document current reporting and identify relevant items for a reporting guideline for studies assessing the impact of scaling strategies, (3) prioritize items for a reporting guideline for studies assessing the impact of scaling strategies using a Delphi process and/or a consensus meeting, (4) pilot test the new reporting guideline SUCCEED, and (5) develop a comprehensive dissemination plan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par13">The development of SUCCEED is guided by the steps recommended for developing health research reporting guidelines and available on the EQUATOR Network website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

A list of expert panelists will be compiled by the research team and include authors of the articles included in the literature review; authors of relevant reporting guidelines; methodologists (experts in systematic review and reporting guideline development); content experts (healthcare professionals and scaling up experts); patient and the public representatives; implementers, e.g., CFHI, The Evidence Project; editors from journals that publish to implementation science and scaling up and from varied countries including low- and middle-income countries, e.g., Implementation Science, Bull. World Health Organization, PloS One, Am J Trop Med Hyg; and funders, e.g., FRQS, CIHR, NIH, EU, WHO, IDRC, Grand Challenges Canada, Melinda and Bill Gates, charities that fund primary care research. An invitation will be sent to all the identified panelists, and an active list and a backup list will be compiled based on their response and availability to participate in the e-Delphi and/or the face-to-face meeting.

The dissemination of this reporting guideline will start with the publication of the protocol of the development of SUCCEED. The publication strategy will be finalized, building on the discussion from the consensus meeting. The development of the guideline will be reported in a statement document that will include the rationale, a brief description of the meeting and participants involved, and the checklist of SUCCEED. Contact will be made with journal editors to secure multiple and simultaneous publication of the guideline and related editorials. The active dissemination approaches will include presenting at relevant scientific conferences, holding webinars, and workshops. We will develop a website (hosted by our institution) and set up a Twitter&#x000ae; account for ongoing interactions with users and will explore other social media platforms as this initiative grows. Finally, we will use different indicators to assess the use of the guideline. These include analytic metrics of the website, the number of &#x0201c;retweets&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;likes,&#x0201d; and the number of new publications that used the guideline.
