However, the existence of mutual interaction between scion and rootstock is often neglected. To explore the origin of different fruit quality traits in citrus, we studied the effect of rootstock and the reciprocal interaction between scion and rootstock of nine combinations; three mandarin varieties grafted on three different rootstocks. We analyzed the metabolic profile of juice via gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively). Additionally, we profiled phloem sap composition in the scion and the rootstock. Quality traits of fruit and their physio-chemical characteristics were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>For all three cultivars, rootstock was found to affect fruit yield and biochemical fruit quality parameters (sugar and acidity) in interactions with the scions. In mandarin juice, eight of 48 compounds (two primary and six secondary) were related directly to the rootstock, and another seven (one primary and six secondary) were interactively affected by scion and rootstock. In scion and rootstock sap, six and 14 of 53 and 55 primary metabolites, respectively, were directly affected by the rootstock, while 42 and 33 were affected by rootstock interactively with scion, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, we show for the first time a reciprocal effect between rootstock and scion.

Several studies on apples, citrus and other deciduous fruit trees have reported the relationships between the type of rootstock and scion in a grafted tree is based on various physiological parameters [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Selection of an appropriate graft combination can be pivotal in respect to nutrient uptake, water potential, plant vigor, fruit quality and yield efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several research reports have documented the significant impact of rootstock on fruit quality in grafted cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there is no available information regarding the direct effects of rootstock on scion physiology and fruit composition, and the interactive effects of scion/rootstock combinations.</p><p>Citrus cultivars are widely commercialized and consumed worldwide, with oranges and mandarins being the most important species [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mandarins are rich in primary metabolites such as organic acids, sugars and amino acids. They also present a great diversity of valuable secondary metabolites such as carotenoids, polyphenols (mainly flavonoids: flavanones and flavones, phenolic acids and limonoids), in addition to volatile compounds that contribute to their nutritional characteristics and health benefits [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The effect of rootstocks on fruit yield is usually related to their impact on fruit size and quality; i.e., sugar and acid contents, sugar: acid ratio and antioxidant potential [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, one of the most commonly used rootstocks, Sour Orange (SO) (<italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> L.) is known to produce moderate yields of orange and grapefruit with average fruit size and good quality [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. SO rootstock enhances tolerance to salinity and alkalinity but on the other hand, is susceptible to citrus nematode and Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV). In comparison to SO, Volkameriana lemon (Volka) (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>volkameriana</italic>, Ten and Pasq.) rootstock provides higher growth vigor, fruit size and total yield. This rootstock is tolerant to <italic>Phytophthora</italic> and CTV but its fruit quality is lower.[<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Similarly, SB-812 [<italic>C</italic>. <italic>sunki</italic> (Hort. ex Tan.) &#x000d7; <italic>Ponciru strifoliata</italic> (L.)] rootstock gives good-quality fruit and exhibits tolerance to CTV and citrus blight, but is salt-sensitive [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Crosstalk between the above and below graft parts is conducted by plant vascular systems, the xylem and phloem. Phloem sap is rich in nutrients, containing a complex mixture of organic and inorganic substances, especially sugars, amino acids, organic acids, minerals and hormones [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Sugars and amino acids are the predominant metabolites in phloem sap, but their content varies in different species [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Tree growth mainly depends on the efficient and controlled distribution of organic and inorganic substances across the tree parts [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Long-distance signaling in response to stress and resource levels are also delivered via the vascular system, for example, sugars and polyols are repartitioned from the leaves to the roots for storage, and ABA and GABA are delivered to the shoots to regulate stomata conductance and signal changes in nitrogen allocation [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Despite the importance of scion-rootstock combination for commercial marketing of citrus fruits, relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between these two plant organs, which involves the forced interaction of two different genotypes. Studies exploring scion-rootstock interaction focus primarily on the effect of tree vigor and pest tolerance. For example, in grapevines, rootstock might have an impact on scion vigor, nutrient uptake [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and production of secondary metabolites in xylem and phloem sap, as host defense against pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Most of the recent studies examine the effect(s) of rootstock on scion development; however, the information regarding the effect of scion on rootstock is lacking. In this work, we explored the reciprocal interaction between scion and rootstock, tackling the role of the phloem sap composition on the metabolite profile of juice, and the physio-chemical characteristics of fruit using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in different citrus cultivars.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Experimental orchard</title><p>The study was carried out in an experimental orchard established in 2005, in the western Negev in Israel (Gilat Research Center; 31&#x000b0;19&#x02019;28.15&#x0201d; N, 34&#x000b0;39&#x02019;20.29&#x0201d; E), 120 m above sea level.

The separation was carried out on a Waters Xevo ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with a mass detector quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) analyzer equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) in both positive and negative modes. The mobile phase consisted of 95% water: 5% acetonitrile: 0.1% formic acid (phase A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (phase B). The solvent gradient program was the following: 100&#x02013;60% solvent A over the first 8 min, 60&#x02013;0% solvent A over 1 min and returned to the initial 100% solvent A in 3.5 min. Acquired chromatograms, mass spectra, metabolite marker tables, and statistical plots were evaluated using MassLynx software, version 4.1.

Based on our results, we found that in addition to known effects of rootstocks on scion performances, scion and rootstock also interact to affect fruit juice and phloem sap composition.</p><p>Regarding rootstock effect on fruit yield, Volka enhanced the yield of Michal, and also of Orra compared to SB-812. At the same time, SB-812 and SO had low yields in combination with both Merav and Orra. However, no rootstock had a significant effect on yield in combination with Merav. Volkameriana lemon is considered to produce vigorous trees producing large quantities of fruits [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Earlier some studies from Florida [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] suggested that yields and net profits over the long term are higher for trees grafted on Volka than for others grafted on less vigorous rootstocks. Our results show that Volka's effect on yield is scion-dependent, and is more pronounced in some scions than in others.</p><p>The physio-chemical results strongly indicated that the effect of rootstock on mandarin fruit juice quality is rather a complex phenomenon that depends on a specific interaction between the rootstock and each scion variety. For instance: while Volka negatively affected TSS levels in Merav and Orra, it did not have such effect in Michal; while SO positively affected Michal and Orra TSS levels, it did not affect Merav; and while Volka induced TSS/TA ratio in Michal, the opposite was true for Merav. Additionally, Volka induced vitamin C contents in Orra, but hindered its production in Merav and Michal. Scion-rootstock interactions thus affect both fruit taste quality and its nutritional value.</p><p>Our results show that fruit juice composition was mainly affected by scion, as of 48 metabolites only 15 were affected by rootstock (eight directly and seven through scion interaction). Of these, eight were related to flavonoids and their biosynthesis: quinic acid, vicenin-2, didymin, narirutin, tangeritin, rutin, diosmin and the amino acid phenylalanine. Another four compounds were limonoid related (nomilin, Nomilinic acid-17-beta-D-glucopyranoside, limonin, Limonin-17-B-D-glucopyranoside), two were amino acids (proline and tryptophan) and one organic acid (threonic acid). The health-related effects of citrus flavonoids have been vastly reported, including anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic and anti-diabetic effects[<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and thus they are also marketed as nutritional supplements. Quinic acid is integral in shikimic acid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], leading to the biosynthesis of flavonols and flavonoids [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Citrus limonoids are ascribed to fruit bitterness, but also possess favorable health properties including anti-oxidative, hypocholesterolemic and anti-carcinogenic effects [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>By analyzing phloem sap composition above and below the grafting zone (scion phloem sap and rootstock phloem sap, respectively) we were able to learn about scion and rootstock interaction in grafted trees. As opposed to fruit juice, both scion sap and rootstock sap were chiefly affected by rootstock and by scion-rootstock interactions: rootstock affected 48 of 53 metabolites in scion sap (six directly and 42 through scion interactions), and 47 of 55 compounds in rootstock sap (14 directly and 33 through scion interactions). It is unclear whether the inconsistency between fruit juice and phloem sap results from a dilution effects occurring along the stem, different time of sampling or organ-dependent gene expression</p><p>When considering directly affected metabolites in the sap (from both scion and rootstock), results show that levels of all these metabolites were low in SB-812. These include ribonic acid, malate, fumarate, phosphoric acid, cysteine, glycine, and pyroglutamate. Juice directly affected metabolites followed the same trend of low levels in SB-812, including quinic acid, nomilin, nomilinic acid-17-beta-D-glucopyranoside and vicenin-2. Additionally, the levels of interactively affected scion sap compounds are also lower in SB-812 in comparison to both other rootstocks, irrespective of the scion, and with not much interaction with the scion grafted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227192.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Rootstock sap interactively affected metabolites also generally followed this trend of low levels in SB-812 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227192.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Proline was the only directly-affected metabolite which levels were higher in SB-812 compared to SO and Volka, and may indicate that as a rootstock SB-812 generates pronounced stress conditions in the trees, as proline was previously reported to be involved in plant stress response [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This stress might by resulting from low levels of essential metabolites, as shown for SB-812 in fruit juice, scion sap and rootstock sap. The lower content of amino acids and sugars in the sap of SB-812, possibly reflective of lower N assimilation and C/N translocation, could eventually lead to a lower quality of fruits. For example, as shown above, SB-812 showed the lowest levels for limonoids nomilin and nomilinic acid-17-beta-D-glucopyranoside. The metabolism of nomilin, the precursor for limonoids, starts in the phloem region via terpenoid biosynthetic pathways from acetate and mevalonate, via farnesyl pyrophosphate [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These pathways depend upon glycolytic precursors. It is thus tempting to suggest that a lower malate and fumarate content in the sap of SB-812 would be associated to lower nomilin in the juice.</p><p>In contrast to SB-812, SO rootstock had high levels of all directly affected metabolites, in both scion and rootstock sap, including valine, ferulic acid, fructose, and glucose. Volka rootstock showed a mixed trend, with low levels of glucose 6P, xylose lyxose and phosphoric acid, and high levels of ribonic acid, maleate, malate and galactopyranose. Both rootstocks demonstrated much interaction with the scion, presenting different profiles for each rootstock-scion combination. Specifically such combinations can be classified according to the degree of scion-rootstock of interaction, manifested by high levels of metabolites (number and intensity). Metabolically strong rootstock-scion interaction is favorable, as a more interactive scion-rootstock system is presumably better in means of plant physiological state, reflecting a more fluent connection between the two organisms of the system. As such, it enables a reciprocal and coherent communication, expressed as metabolite transfer between the two parts, and possibly allowing more flexibility in response to environmental conditions, including stress, resulting in long-lasting trees.</p><p>Based on that parameter, it is evident in scion sap that the Orra-Volka combination has the lowest interaction (aside from all SB-812 combinations as discussed above), followed by Merav-SO, Merav-Volka and Orra-SO. The Michal-SO and Michal-Volka are the best combinations in regard to rootstock-scion interaction. In rootstock sap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227192.g004">Fig 4</xref>) it can be seen that in general, the interaction is more significant (shown by number of high-level compounds and by fold change (FC) ratio), showing even some level of scion-rootstock interaction for certain SB-812 combinations. Rootstock sap combinations follow the trend shown in scion sap, with the best performance to Michal-Volka and Michal-SO, and lowest interaction in 812, mainly for Merav and Orra.</p><p>Although the number of interactive metabolites is higher in scion sap than in rootstock sap (47 vs.33), the degree of interaction is greater in the rootstock sap, while metabolites in the scion sap are less affected. Together with the larger number of directly affected metabolites in rootstock sap (14) compared to scion sap (6) and juice (8) (while total number of compounds is generally the same), this suggests a distance-dependent effect for the rootstock. The rootstock imposes its effect locally, and thus it is greatest in rootstock sap, followed by scion sap, and lowest in juice, as shown by the number of directly and interactively affected compounds, and the degree of influence.</p><p>Notably, among interactive metabolites are important transporters of carbon, such as sucrose and raffinose [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and of nitrogen, like 4-amino butanoic acid (GABA) and glutamate [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which showed significant change in their relative content. These data suggest that selection of an appropriate rootstock may provide a powerful means to manage the plant energy metabolism and transport for the benefit of the growth and fruiting of the scion.</p><p>Interestingly, a small number of metabolites were affected by neither scion, rootstock or their interaction. In juice these were apigenin, myo-inositol, sucrose and asparagine, and tartaric acid in scion sap. These compounds might play an important role in citrus, as suggested for tartaric acid in citrus as a source of ascorbic acid [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or for myo-inositol for cell signaling, mainly under stress [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], thus deliberately maintained at constant levels by the tree. Alternatively, they could be affected by different factors, other than scion or rootstock.</p><p>Taken together, our results clearly suggest that rootstock-scion combination is a reciprocal system, crucial to fruit quality and juice and sap composition, with possible impact over tree physiology. Our work suggests a reciprocal relationship between the scion and roots in a grafted tree, whereby a mutual alteration/acclimation process in the metabolism is developing in the forced connection between two different genotypes. Furthermore, characteristics of either a scion or a rootstock cannot be determined for themselves, but rather only in interaction with each scion/ rootstock. Accordingly, choosing a rootstock-scion combination should first take into consideration the required characteristics of either the scion or the rootstock (e.g., salinity tolerance), followed by a careful choice of its compatible partner.</p><p>Specifically, our results indicate that SB-812 has the lowest level of scion-rootstock interaction, while Michal-Volka, Michal-SO and Orra-SO combinations have the highest level of interaction. Further research is required in order to determine the biochemical mechanisms underlie this phenomenon, and should include a more detailed analysis of the interaction, including tree-physiological parameters, in addition to possibly identifying specific chemical and physiological markers to indicate the quality of interaction, in order to examine new combinations. Additionally, to better understand the locality attribute of scion-rootstock interaction, more sap measurements should be done alongside the grafting zone, in varying distances.</p><p>Principally, every rootstock- scion combination is kind of a new organiam by itself. As a result, all the metabolic pathways are potentially affected by the grafing in both rootstock and scion. Yet, some of the metabolic pathways are strongly affected by rootstock (branced chain amino acid metabolism) while others by scion (fatty acid metaolism and secondary metabolites metabolism). This makes sense since its well known that some of the hormones that move along the plant are dominantly produced by the roots (e.g. cytokinins) while other are produced by the shoots (e.g. auxin). Therefore whenever we choose to create a new rootstock-scion combination, its potential effect on metabolic pathways should be taken into consideration. The effect on the pathways may vary along season and based on tree's age. The scion-rootstock union unite intimately, providing a viable system for the uptake and translocation of minerals, water, assimilates, and hormones throughout the entire lifespan of the tree [<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227192.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Improved understanding of this crosstalk will enhance the selection process for grafting material, favoring combinations that will benefit fruit quality, fruit metabolism and phloem sap composition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, in this work we show for the first time a reciprocal interaction between rootstock and scion. Some of the rootstock effect that was found on the rootstock phloem sap also appeared in scion phloem sap, but not in fruit. Such inconsistency between the phloem sap and fruit might be due to the distance from the grafting zone (a dilution effect with distance), to sampling timing, or could arise from organ-dependent gene expression. The distance, organ and timing effects are currently investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227192.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primary metabolites identified in mandarin fruit juice in scion-rootstock combinatios.</title><p>Small letters- scion statistics; Capital letters-rootstock statistics; bold letters-interaction statistics.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227192.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227192.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Secondary metabolites identified in mandarin fruit juice in scion-rootstock combinatios.</title><p>Small letters- scion statistics; Capital letters-rootstock statistics; bold letters-interaction statistics.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227192.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227192.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Primary metabolites identified in mandarin scion phloem sap.</title><p>Small letters- scion statistics; Capital letters-rootstock statistics.
