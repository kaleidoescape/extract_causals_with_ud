Transcription of the ten RSV genes proceeds sequentially from the 3&#x02019; promoter and requires conserved gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) signals. Previous studies using the prototypical GA1 genotype Long and A2 strains have indicated a gradient of gene transcription extending across the genome, with the highest level of mRNA coming from the most promoter-proximal gene, the first nonstructural (NS1) gene, and mRNA levels from subsequent genes dropping until reaching a minimum at the most promoter-distal gene, the polymerase (L) gene. However, recent reports show non-gradient levels of mRNA, with higher than expected levels from the attachment (G) gene. It is unknown to what extent different transcript stabilities might shape measured mRNA levels. It is also unclear whether patterns of RSV gene expression vary, or show strain- or genotype-dependence. To address this, mRNA abundances from five RSV genes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in three cell lines and in cotton rats infected with RSV isolates belonging to four genotypes (GA1, ON, GB1, BA). Relative mRNA levels reached steady-state between four and 24 hours post-infection. Steady-state patterns were non-gradient and genotype-specific, where mRNA levels from the G gene exceeded those from the more promoter-proximal nucleocapsid (N) gene across isolates. Transcript stabilities could not account for the non-gradient patterns observed, indicating that relative mRNA levels more strongly reflect transcription than decay. Our results indicate that gene expression from a small but diverse set of RSV genotypes is non-gradient and genotype-dependent. We propose novel models of RSV transcription that can account for non-gradient transcription.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Sequences reported in this study were deposited in GenBank database under accession numbers MG813977-MG813995.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Sequences reported in this study were deposited in GenBank database under accession numbers MG813977-MG813995.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can infect individuals repeatedly and is the most common pathogen associated with severe lower respiratory tract disease in children worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

The two subgroups are estimated to have diverged from an ancestral strain over 300 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and have evolved into multiple co-circulating genotypes [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Transcription in RSV and other NSV is sequential, with genes transcribed in their order of occurrence from the 3&#x02019; promoter of the genome [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Each of the ten genes of RSV contains essential gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) signals flanking the open reading frame (ORF) [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Transcription is initiated at the GS signal which also serves as a capping signal on the 5&#x02019; end of the nascent mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The polymerase then enters elongation mode until it reaches a GE signal, where the mRNA is polyadenylated and released [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Two genes overlap at the 5&#x02019; end of the RSV genome. The GE signal of matrix 2 (M2) occurs downstream of the GS signal of the large polymerase (L) gene. The polymerase must return from the M2 GE signal for full-length L mRNA to be made [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], suggesting that transcribing polymerases scan the RSV genome bidirectionally for a new GS signal after terminating transcription. Indeed, scanning polymerase dynamics may be a universal feature of NSV transcription [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>By homology with other NSV, it is widely assumed that transcription in RSV follows a gradient, where the extent to which a gene is transcribed falls with its distance from the 3' promoter [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This is believed to be due to transcriptional attenuation at the intergenic (IG) regions, although the mechanisms underlying the attenuation are unknown [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Earlier studies reported results consistent with a gradient [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; however, recent studies show RSV mRNA abundances that peak at the G gene, which is the seventh gene downstream of the 3&#x02019; promoter of the genome [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We recently reported the G gene to be the most abundant in clinical samples obtained from RSV/A- and RSV/B-infected infants [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, existing data suggest the possibility that RSV gene expression can be non-gradient and variable.</p><p>Here we explored the natural diversity of patterns of RSV gene expression by using qPCR to measure mRNA abundances of five different RSV genes [nonstructural genes one and two (NS1, NS2), nucleocapsid (N), attachment (G), and Fusion (F)] from isolates that we sequenced belonging to both subgroups and four genotypes (RSV/A/GA1, RSV/A/ON, RSV/B/GB1, RSV/B/BA). Genotype-dependent patterns were observed, all diverging from a gradient and all showing higher levels of G mRNA than expected. Transcript stabilities did not account for the non-gradient patterns, indicating that mRNA levels reflect transcription more than decay. We propose novel models incorporating the possible effects of stochastic transcription and/or the recycling of transcribing polymerases in order to begin rationalizing non-gradient RSV transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>RSV mRNA abundances</title><p>Oligonucleotide standards of known concentration were used to convert cycle threshold (<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub>) values measured by real-time PCR for mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227558.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) to mRNA abundances.

Therefore, we measured transcript stabilities by blocking transcription using the RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor GS-5734 then monitoring mRNA levels by qPCR over time. Decay was measured for all five mRNAs from each of the four isolates in HEp-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227558.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Exponential decay functions were fit to the data and half-lives were calculated from the decay constants.

A gene expression gradient has been widely assumed for RSV, but supporting data come from a modest number of studies and are largely restricted to laboratory-adapted isolates (Long and A2) from the prototypic GA1 genotype of subgroup A. The first measurements were made by Collins and Wertz (1983) using an A2 strain in HEp-2 cells [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. They discovered the gene order of RSV and found it was approximated by decreasing mRNA abundances measured by northern blot [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Barik later reported a gradient by dot blot hybridization of radiolabeled mRNAs produced <italic>in vitro</italic> using ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex from an RSV Long strain and cell extract from uninfected HEp-2 cells [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Over a decade later, Boukhvalova et al. measured a gradient-like pattern by qPCR of mRNA abundances from an RSV Long strain grown in A549 cells [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast, Aljabr et al. recently reported mRNA abundances by RNA-Seq from an A2 strain in HEp-2 cells that are inconsistent with a gradient. The most abundant mRNA they observed was associated with the G gene [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Levitz et al. reported non-gradient mRNA levels and found the G gene to be the most highly expressed at later time-points in A549 cells infected with isolates from the RSV/B subgroup [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, recent published data indicate that patterns of RSV gene expression vary and do not always follow a gradient. Here, we report data from isolates belonging to four different genotypes (GA1, ON, GB1, BA) and of variable passage number (GA1 and GB1 &#x0003e; 10, ON = 6, BA = 7) showing non-gradient and variable patterns of gene expression, and all with an apparent excess of G mRNA. These results require us to rethink existing models of RSV and NSV transcription.</p><p>Accurate mRNA abundance measurements by qPCR require reagents that bind target without any mismatches [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Perfectly designed and distinct sets of reagents can amplify target with variable efficiency, as the amplification efficiency depends on the physicochemical properties of the reagents (the free energies of different intra- and intermolecular interactions) and the qPCR conditions used. For our 20 oligonucleotide standards, we found the lowest melting temperature from each set of reagents correlated positively with amplification efficiencies and negatively with cycle threshold values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227558.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These correlations indicate that physicochemical differences in the primers and probes can account for the minor variation observed in the amplification of oligonucleotide standards, and support the accuracy of our approach to measuring viral mRNA abundances.</p><p>Among the genotype-dependent patterns of RSV transcription observed, the greatest difference occurred between subgroups A and B in the mRNA levels of NS1 and NS2. The similar levels of NS1 and NS2 from the RSV/A genotypes (GA1, ON) might partly be a result of frequent polymerase read-through from a weak NS1 GE signal [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Levels of NS2 are ~5-fold lower than NS1 from the RSV/B genotypes (GB1, BA), and these genotypes show conserved substitutions just outside of the canonical NS1 GE signal [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is possible that these substitutions promote more efficient termination of transcription at NS1, and, along with transcriptional attenuation at the NS1-NS2 junction, thereby cause less transcription of NS2. Regarding potential functional origins of the difference between A and B subgroups in the transcription of NS1 and NS2, it should be remembered that both G protein and NS2 can suppress interferon signaling [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Perhaps the G protein of subgroup B is more active than that of subgroup A in suppressing the interferon response, relaxing the need for the higher level of NS2 transcription observed in the two RSV/A strains. If this is true, and assuming a lack of translational differences, then similar patterns of transcription should be observed for other A and B strains. The remaining differences among genotype-dependent transcription patterns likely result from more subtle genomic differences and differences in mRNA stabilities. It is also worth mentioning that patterns of RSV transcription show higher relative levels of NS1 and NS2 in cotton rat samples than samples from cell culture. This might reflect greater stringency on productive viral infection within a fully immunocompetent host.</p><p>Non-gradient gene expression requires some mechanism/s to alter the likelihood of transcription at different genes. To address this, we propose two basic and <italic>a priori</italic> mutually compatible models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227558.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Each model is biophysically reasonable and consistent with existing data. Our findings are relevant not only to understanding RSV but potentially also to the understanding of transcription and gene regulation in all other NSV.</p><fig id="pone.0227558.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227558.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Non-gradient transcription requires novel models of RSV transcription.</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> The hitherto widely accepted model of RSV (and all NSV) transcription involves sequential transcription from the 3&#x02019; promoter and transcriptional attenuation at gene junctions. Shown in black and orange is a cartoon representation of an idealized NSV genome. The green arrows represent equal probabilities of transcription at each of five genes, and the red arrows represent equal attenuation of transcription at each gene junction. Combined with sequential transcription, equal probabilities of transcription and equal rates of attenuation (and assuming equal transcript stabilities) result in a gradient of mRNA levels (shown as a plot depicting decreasing levels of mRNA from genes 1 to 5). <bold>(b)</bold> Non-gradient RSV transcription requires alternative models. Two such models incorporate either 1) transcription of variable probability (top cartoon&#x02013;see green arrow of increased size indicating a higher probability of transcription at gene 3) and/or 2) polymerase recycling (bottom cartoon&#x02013;see blue arrows indicating successive rounds of transcription of the same gene, with gene 3 supporting more rounds of transcription). Transcription of variable probability at different genes is supported by published data showing varied effects of different cis-acting sequences on gene expression. Polymerase recycling describes the repeated transcription of a single gene by one or more polymerases before proceeding to a downstream gene. Polymerase recycling would require polymerase scanning, which is well established, and potentially a mechanism to bias polymerase scanning away from the next downstream GS signal and back toward the upstream GS signal.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0227558.g006"/></fig><p>RSV transcription is widely thought to be obligatorily sequential with attenuation at gene junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227558.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Sequential transcription is well supported by existing molecular biological and ultraviolet (UV) transcriptional mapping data [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but we believe the idea of <italic>obligatorily</italic> sequential transcription should be reappraised. Obligatorily sequential transcription means that a polymerase must transcribe genes in their order of occurrence from the 3&#x02019; promoter; but, the initiation of transcription is a molecular event and is thereby stochastic. Thus, there is only ever a probability of transcription when a polymerase encounters a GS signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227558.g006">Fig 6</xref>), and a polymerase can, in principle, scan past a GS signal before encountering another GS signal, downstream of the first, at which transcription is initiated. With sequential, but not obligatorily sequential, transcription, non-gradient gene expression is possible, and could result from higher probabilities of transcription initiation at one or more internal genes than those upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227558.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Thus, the relative excess of G gene mRNA observed in our experiments could occur from polymerases, more often than not, failing to initiate transcription at the N gene before initiating at the G gene. Consistent with the idea of gene or locus-dependent rates of transcription, studies in RSV and other NSV show that gene expression depends on a variety of potentially mutable cis-acting factors [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, polymerase recycling, which is not incompatible with stochastic and gene-dependent transcription, could also account for sequential and non-gradient transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227558.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Polymerase recycling is the possibility of repeated rounds of transcription of a single gene by one or more polymerases. It fundamentally requires polymerase scanning and, in order to account for non-gradient transcription, some mechanism/s to bias, in a locus-dependent way, that scanning away from a downstream GS signal and toward the original upstream GS signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227558.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). It is therefore possible that the N gene is usually expressed before the G gene, but G mRNA accumulates more because of polymerase scanning and increased re-initiation of transcription at the G gene GS signal. Either or both alternative models could help account for non-gradient transcription.</p><p>Our work establishes the existence of non-gradient and genotype-dependent transcription in RSV, and thus suggests the possibility of such gene expression in other NSV. We hypothesize that non-gradient transcription requires either 1) the initiation of transcription with unequal probabilities at different genes; and/or 2) locus-dependent polymerase recycling. Efforts should be made toward discovering and characterizing possible mechanisms, and integrating candidate mechanisms into simple, biophysically reasonable, and testable models of NSV transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Virus strains</title><p>RSV isolates were initially genotyped as described [<xref rid="pone.0227558.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227558.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] by sequencing a 270 bp fragment in the second hypervariable region of the G gene.

Previous studies have suggested that the gene transcription is sequential whereas the authors of this manuscript provide preliminary data, verifying other data in the field, that there can be non-sequential gene transcription. The data are supportive of this concept and the discussion offers some suggested mechanisms of how this mechanism could occur. The order of gene transcription in different cell lines and in cotton rats are consistent and genotype specific. While interesting, there is no further exploration of the mechanisms that might differentially regulate these findings that is dependent upon genotype. Furthermore, and perhaps more interesting, no additional exploration of what might be the consequence to this mechanism in the different genotypes. Does the differential expression of different genes give an infective advantage? Perhaps it alters the host response to the virus in some manner? These data provide solid preliminary data for further, more indepth investigation as to the "biologic" function of such a mechanism and/or how this mechanism is facilitated/regulated by the different genotypes explored.</p><p>A final issue is whether these mechanisms develop due to the time passaged in tissue culture, with the more recently derived strains (although still several years) having a similar expression profile compared to the longer term strains, especially regarding the NS2 gene. The older, for example, have likely been differentially passaged many times in different long term cell lines, Hep2, Vero. This consideration is as likely to account for differences as any other pressure. The question may not be can it happen, rather does it normally happen and what impact does it have on the normal infectivity, success of the viral replication, and disease associated outcome in vivo.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>November 21, 2019</p><p>Dear Dr. Vargas and Reviewers:</p><p>Thank you for reviewing our manuscript, &#x02018;Non-gradient and genotype-dependent patterns of RSV gene expression.&#x02019; Thank you also for the opportunity to respond to the insightful comments made, and the important questions raised. We have done our best to answer fully. </p><p>Please see the reviewers&#x02019; comments (in italics) and our responses (in bold) below.</p><p>______________________________________________________________________</p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>Piedra et al make observations that challenge the widely held belief that a mRNA gradient exists in RSV due to obligatorily sequential transcription with attenuation at gene junctions. mRNAs of five genes are quantitated over time, both in vitro and in vivo, and stability of each mRNA is also examined. This is an interesting and well-written study with original data, which show that steady state mRNA levels are genotype-dependent and do not follow a gradient, and that the non-gradient cannot be attributed to variations in mRNA stability. The study has implications for other NSV as well, and is in reasonable agreement with recent findings from other groups using distinct techniques. The use of 4 virus variants that cover the A and B subgroups, and confirmation of the findings in multiple cell lines as well as in infected cotton rats, is a notable strength of this paper. Statistical significance is not addressed for most of the data, and more discussion on some of their findings will help the reader interpret the work.</p><p>Comments</p><p>- Conclusions are in general well supported but any indication of significance of observed differences is lacking. Authors claim for example that NS1 levels decrease for all isolates after four hours, but the mentioned differences seem small and it&#x02019;s not clear if they are significant. Also, in Fig. 2 it is not clear whether the means represent the mean of two independent experiments or the mean of all samples over two independent experiments.</p><p>Two kinds of observed difference are central to the paper: 1) the difference between measured RSV mRNA abundances and those expected from a gradient; and 2) differences among measured steady-state gene expression patterns belonging to strains from four different genotypes of RSV. It is worth stating that both kinds of difference are clear from the plotted data (see Fig3), and it does seem that the reviewer agrees with this point. The decrease in relative levels of NS1 mRNA after 4 hours post-infection (pi) is slight but consistent across genotypes (avg. = 11&#x000b1;8%). We find this interesting because a decrease in transcription from more 3&#x02019; proximal genes is consistent with the change that would be expected between pre-steady-state and steady-state relative mRNA levels resulting from sequential transcription. In addition, and as mentioned in the text, decreases for GA1 and BA were larger (avg. = 17&#x000b1;7%), and these strains showed lower total amounts of mRNA at t=4 hr pi. A steeper drop and lower total mRNA at the start of the experiment suggest that our 4 hr measurements occurred closer to the start of transcription for GA1 and BA than ON and GB1. Finally, each bar in each histogram of Fig2 represents the mean of two independent experiments, and not the mean of all wells over two independent experiments. </p><p>- Two major findings of mRNA quantitation (in addition to being non-gradient) are that G mRNA levels are relatively high and that relative NS2 mRNA levels vary considerably between A and B isolates; can the authors speculate on the meaning of their findings?</p><p>G protein is needed for both viral attachment to host cells and immunosuppression and evasion. Perhaps relatively high (and non-gradient) levels of G mRNA are required to make sufficient G protein (transmembrane and secreted) to support robust infection and transmission of virus. Also, both G protein and NS2 are involved in suppressing interferon signaling. It is possible that the G protein of subgroup B is more active than that of A in its NS2-like function, relaxing the need for the higher level of NS2 transcription seen here in the two strains belonging to the A subgroup. If this is true, and assuming a lack of translational differences, then similar patterns of transcription should be observed for other A and B strains. We have amended our discussion (lines 279-286) in order to incorporate our answer to this question. </p><p>- In the B isolates, the G:NS2 mRNA ratio appears to differ between cell lines and cotton rats. Can the authors say something about this result?</p><p>This could be a result of different transcript stabilities; relative mRNA abundances for NS1 and NS2 are, regardless of genotype, greater in cotton rat (CR) samples than samples from in vitro cell culture. Furthermore, the F:NS2 mRNA ratio is the most different between cell lines and CRs, followed by the G:NS2. These differences might also reflect the impact of the innate and adaptive immune response of the cotton rat on the life cycle of the virus. </p><p>- Lab-adaptation in previous studies is mentioned as one possible explanation for the difference in gradients or non-gradients measured between older and newer studies resp. Are the isolates used here not lab-adapted?</p><p>We mention in the discussion (lines 239-242) that most published data concerning RSV gene expression come from one of two lab-adapted strains (Long &#x00026; A2) of subgroup A. This is stated more to indicate the dearth of viral diversity explored than to suggest a relationship between lab-adaptation and gradient gene expression. In fact, Aljabr et al. report non-gradient mRNA levels from an A2 strain. Our data do not support a relationship between gradient/non-gradient gene expression and more/less passage, and suggest that RSV gene expression depends more on subgroup and genotype. The two prototypic strains that we used (RSV/A/GA1/Tracy and RSV/B/GB1/18537) have been passaged more than ten times, while the two contemporaneous strains (RSV/A/ON/121301043A and RSV/B/BA/80171) have been passaged 6 and 7 times, respectively. Lines 256-257 (in discussion) and 362-365 (in materials and methods) have been added to make this clear. </p><p>- Read-through transcription is briefly mentioned in the discussion in an attempt to explain differences in NS2 mRNA levels. Could complex read-through transcription play an important role in non-gradient steady state levels?</p><p>In the simplest case, read-through transcription should have the effect of making relative mRNA levels (from, for example, neighboring genes) less different not more, and should flatten 3&#x02019; to 5&#x02019; negative gradients and not produce &#x02018;bumps&#x02019; in transcription; but the transcriptional &#x02018;bumps&#x02019; leading to non-gradient steady-state mRNA levels could result from the coupling of read-through transcription and polymerase recycling. </p><p>- NS2 mRNA was previously shown to have a short half-life. The current findings do not confirm the previous. Can the authors address this difference?</p><p>We are aware of published data (Evans JE, et al. Virus Res. 1996 Aug; 43(2):155-61) showing a short half-life for NS2 protein in BS-C-1 cells, but cannot come across data (outside of our own) for mRNA stability. Furthermore, Evans et al. showed the 40 kDa form of the NS2 protein to be stable while the 14.5 and 30 kDa forms rapidly disappeared during the pulse-chase experiments. </p><p>- The authors propose two models, variable probability of transcription and polymerase recycling. However, rather than each representing a model, variable probability is more like an outcome, for which polymerase recycling could be one of the potential mechanisms. There is no data that aims to elucidate or support a model by which the virus regulates probability of transcription.</p><p>With all due respect, we prefer to separate these distinct, albeit not incompatible, possibilities. Here, variable probability of transcription refers to the local probability of transcription initiation &#x02013; i.e., the probability of transcription initiation at a GS signal when a viral polymerase is near or &#x02018;on&#x02019; it (see lines 322-327). At the very least this probability depends on the GS signal and neighboring (including intergenic) sequence (we have also obtained evidence suggesting that the alignment of a GS signal with nucleoprotein can alter its recognition by a polymerase (data not presented here)). Polymerase recycling over a certain gene more than others can increase transcription from that gene even if the local probability of transcription initiation is constant across GS signals. </p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>In these studies the relative abundance of gene transcription is assessed across the RSV genome. Previous studies have suggested that the gene transcription is sequential whereas the authors of this manuscript provide preliminary data, verifying other data in the field, that there can be non-sequential gene transcription. The data are supportive of this concept and the discussion offers some suggested mechanisms of how this mechanism could occur. The order of gene transcription in different cell lines and in cotton rats are consistent and genotype specific. While interesting, there is no further exploration of the mechanisms that might differentially regulate these findings that is dependent upon genotype. Furthermore, and perhaps more interesting, no additional exploration of what might be the consequence to this mechanism in the different genotypes. Does the differential expression of different genes give an infective advantage? Perhaps it alters the host response to the virus in some manner? These data provide solid preliminary data for further, more indepth investigation as to the "biologic" function of such a mechanism and/or how this mechanism is facilitated/regulated by the different genotypes explored.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that our findings are solid and need to be studied in relation to their biological meaning within the human host. Such studies are currently ongoing but are not the topic of this report.</p><p>A final issue is whether these mechanisms develop due to the time passaged in tissue culture, with the more recently derived strains (although still several years) having a similar expression profile compared to the longer term strains, especially regarding the NS2 gene. The older, for example, have likely been differentially passaged many times in different long term cell lines, Hep2, Vero. This consideration is as likely to account for differences as any other pressure. The question may not be can it happen, rather does it normally happen and what impact does it have on the normal infectivity, success of the viral replication, and disease associated outcome in vivo.</p><p>Our data do not show a relationship between RSV gene expression and passage number, and suggest that RSV gene expression patterns depend more on subgroup and genotype. The two prototypic strains that we used (RSV/A/GA1/Tracy and RSV/B/GB1/18537) have been passaged more than ten times, while the two contemporaneous strains (RSV/A/ON/121301043A and RSV/B/BA/80171) have been passaged 6 and 7 times, respectively. Lines 256-257 (in discussion) and 362-365 (in materials and methods) have been added to make this clear. ____________________________________________________________________</p><p>We appreciate the chance to respond to the above comments and questions.

</p><p>December 18, 2019</p><p>Dear Dr. Vargas:</p><p>Please see the remaining two comments (in italics) and our responses (in bold) below.</p><p>______________________________________________________________________</p><p>Reviewer #1: Piedra et al have adequately addressed most of the stated concerns. Questions about two of the concerns remain, see below.</p><p>1) Statistical significance.</p><p>As to the example in item 1), the mentioned decrease in NS1 levels after four hours is not clear in Fig. 2. No statistical significance has been added. The norm to determine and communicate the likelyhood that stated differences (whether appearing subtle or not) are real is to calculate p values.</p><p>We have added a supplementary figure (S2Fig) depicting measured levels of NS1 at 4 hours post-infection (pi) and &#x0003e; 4 hours pi. The noted decrease is statistically significant when analyzed by regression modelling. The manuscript has been modified to incorporate this information (see lines 154-158 and 476-484). </p><p>2) mRNA ratio variation between cell culture and cotton rats.</p><p>* In answering this question, the authors argue that perhaps transcript stabilities cause this difference. However, a general point in the paper is that the non-gradient is not caused by variations in transcript stabilities. These seem to contradict?</p><p>The data we present indicate that transcript stabilities cannot account for the non-gradientness of the mRNA levels measured, not that transcript stabilities cannot at all affect relative mRNA levels. Moreover, in vitro transcript stabilities were measured, not in vivo stabilities. We therefore do not know what effect (if any) in vivo transcript stabilities might have on the difference between RSV mRNA levels in samples from cell culture and cotton rats. </p><p>* This difference between in vitro and in vivo stands out and is interesting and could be important in assessing the value of vitro differences. Therefore the authors should include this finding in the discussion.</p><p>We agree that the difference between in vitro and in vivo patterns of RSV transcription is interesting.
