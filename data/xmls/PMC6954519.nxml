In recent years, due to the progress of science and technology and the continuous development of medicine, the survival rate and survival time of stroke patients have been greatly improved and prolonged, but the disability rate is still high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The loss of activities of living of patients after stroke is mostly caused by upper-limb dysfunction, especially hand dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hand functional exercise is the premise of alleviating hand dysfunction, and the alleviation of hand spasm is the basis for timely and effective hand functional exercise. Hence, alleviating hand spasm after stroke has far-reaching significance in reducing disability rate and improving the daily activities of living of patients. At present, the main methods to relieve the increased muscle tension after stroke are drug intervention and non-drug therapy (such as physical factors and kinesiotherapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Sometimes, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, massage, brace, orthosis and use of a rehabilitation robot are used as adjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Each therapy has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p id="Par6">Drug intervention mainly includes using central antispasmodic drugs and peripheral-nerve local-blocking antispasmodic drugs. Current clinical applications have achieved some positive results. The use of central antispasmodic drugs is relatively simple and convenient, but long-term use will likely lead to obvious drug resistance and related adverse reactions, such as muscle weakness, nausea, mental depression, etc. In clinical application, drug replacement and dosage adjustment should be often considered. Botulinum toxin A is the representative of peripheral-nerve local-blockade antispasmodics. However, botulinum toxin A can only be used as a component of a multidisciplinary combination to alleviate the increase of limb-muscle tension after stroke. Other therapies are often needed in clinical application. In addition, in view of the technical difficulties and high cost of the clinical implementation of botulinum toxin A, it has not been widely carried out in the clinic to alleviate the increase of limb-muscle tension after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Physical therapy is mainly divided into exercise therapy, manipulation therapy and physical factor therapy. Exercise therapy and manipulation therapy can inhibit and weaken spasticity-inducing factors in patients with post-stroke limb spasm, so that limb movement control and motor function can be significantly strengthened and improved. However, a longer intervening time should be guaranteed in the treatment of post-stroke limb spasticity, and the individual condition of the patients should be taken into account in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In order to reduce the adverse effects caused by excessive exercise, we should adjust the range, intensity, frequency, and course of training. Physical factor therapy includes paraffin therapy, hydrotherapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, biofeedback therapy, functional electrical stimulation and shock-wave therapy. Physical factor therapy has been widely used in the treatment of limb spasm after stroke, and has achieved certain effects, but its exact mechanism is still unclear, and there is a lack of evidence-based medical evidence for large-sample clinical research. In addition, the implementation of physical factor therapy has not yet been standardized or clinical guidelines set; the operation depends on personal preferences and experience, and the intensity of stimulation and dose in different clinical reports varies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Orthosis and rehabilitation robots, with their good sustainability and rhythm, can assist in alleviating hand spasm after stroke and reduce the workload of therapists to some extent, but their sensitivity and regulation ability are poor, and they are expensive. They also require space and related technical personnel, which is not conducive with their clinical promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although many positive results have been achieved in the study of traditional acupuncture and massage in the treatment of post-apoplectic limb spasm, it is often necessary to select multiple acupoints to achieve a curative effect. Also, the acupoints selected by each research group are different, which is not conducive with its clinical promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, the criteria, principles and operating essentials of massage manipulation need to be unified and standardized, and its mechanism needs urgent clarification. All these circumstances encourage us to seek more simple, convenient, effective and inexpensive forms of rehabilitation therapy.</p><p id="Par7">At present, the existence of myofascial trigger points has been widely accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The myofascial trigger point is a common hand-spasm factor in stroke patients. In long-term rehabilitation clinical practice, the team found that physicians could touch a cord-shaped nodule as the most obvious sore point of the patient&#x02019;s discomfort, i.e., the fascia point to be needled, by pressing between the first and second metacarpal bones on the dorsal of the patients with hand spasm after stroke from the far side to the proximal side with thumb pulp. Preliminary clinical observation of 16 patients with hand spasm after stroke treated by fascial-point acupuncture has been completed in our group. The results show that fascial-point acupuncture can effectively alleviate hand spasm immediately after stroke, but its cumulative effect, duration of spasm relief and long-term efficacy need further clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that this multi-site, prospective clinical trial be carried out to further evaluate the clinical efficacy of fascial-point acupuncture in relieving hand spasm after stroke.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial objectives</title><p id="Par8">The objectives of this trial are as follows:

A preliminary clinical observation of 16 cases of hand spasm after stroke treated by fascial-point acupuncture has been completed in our group. The results show that fascial-point acupuncture can effectively alleviate hand spasm immediately after stroke. However, its cumulative effect, duration of spasm relief and long-term efficacy need further clinical study. Hence, here we propose a multicenter, prospective and randomized clinical trial to further evaluate the clinical efficacy of fascial-point acupuncture in relieving hand spasm after stroke.</p><p id="Par66">In order to eliminate the interference of acupuncture itself on the experimental results, a sham acupuncture group will be established in this study. However, bias exists in all clinical trials. In our trial, the blindness of the acupuncturists and patients in designing a randomized controlled trial involving acupuncture manipulation will be the most challenging aspect. Therefore, surface EMG measurements are also used as part of the outcome assessment in addition to the scales used in previous studies. In recent years, EMG has been widely used in spasticity assessment, especially after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The application of electrophysiological measurement can provide quantitative information of spasticity and reduce the interference of subjective factors in scale evaluation. In addition, the multicenter development of the study is also related to biases, mainly including differences in acupuncture techniques. We tried to eliminate these biases by examining the needling procedures of other participating hospitals and training acupuncturists in all participating centers. We firmly believe that the results of this study will help to lay a foundation for the alleviation of hand spasm after stroke and functional improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par67">The total registration period will last for 2&#x02009;years and follow-up for 6&#x02009;months.
