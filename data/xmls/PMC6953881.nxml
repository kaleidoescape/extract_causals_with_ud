Evidence shows that PA is a protective behavior on major non-communicable diseases, such as coronary heart disease, type II diabetes and cancer [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, global PA prevalence is still low, placing PA promotion as a priority in the public health agenda and, therefore, demonstrating the need of monitoring PA at population levels [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Accelerometers (portable motion sensors) have been increasingly adopted in large scale studies, since they provide more accurate physiological and mechanical parameters to estimate PA [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the last decade, the use of accelerometers for this purpose increased significantly [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], due to the capability to quantify duration, frequency and intensity of PA through acceleration signals, movement patterns and magnitude [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Also, currently available accelerometers enable large quantity of data storage, a variety of cut-off points for different PA intensities, movement pattern recognition and the possibility of more detailed analyses using the raw data [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>For a better understanding of the prevalence, levels and impact of PA on health, accurate measures are essential. However, with the increase of accelerometer-based research, the variability among protocols is also rising, since there is no standardized recommendation for data collection. Also, there are different sources of variability, such as accelerometers brands, placements, unit of analysis, minimum number of hours per day and minimum number of measurement days [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. All these decisions will influence final PA estimates at some degree, and therefore must be discussed according to their advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Therefore, the literature regarding the PA monitoring frame presents some evidence that a high percentage of participants are usually excluded from analysis for not being considered as presenting sufficiently valid accelerometer data across different age groups [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, how representative is the available data when compared to the habitual PA period is not often discussed. Considering that, in reduced sample sizes, differential losses are frequent between subgroups and PA estimates might be biased[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Historically, considering that during the first two decades of accelerometer use these measurements have been conducted by waist/hip-worn devices, a decision regarding the minimum number of hours per day was crucial to define valid days of measurement and, consequently, the minimum number of days to estimate habitual physical activity. However, studies using wrist-worn accelerometers usually adopt a 24 hours-protocol, which increases compliance [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the remaining issue is the minimum days of measurement, which is an important decision defining the logistics of the study and representativeness of habitual PA behavior.</p><p>The wrist-worn accelerometry literature regarding this issue has not come to a consensus yet, however some studies have analyzed the ideal number of days for accelerometry measurement [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among adults, around two or three days of measurement are required depending on the evaluated PA construct [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, Scheers et al.[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] suggest that PA should be measured for two weekend days and three weekdays in order to achieve a common week reliability in adults. Also, some studies recommend the inclusion of weekend days on PA estimates [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among children, the widely accepted recommendation seems to be between three and four measurement days [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In this sense, it is imperative to discuss not only how many days of measurement will be needed to adequately measure PA, but also how many days will be considered valid. Moreover, scientific literature regarding this subject is mostly from high income settings and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) must be studied due to potential differences in terms of compliance of accelerometer use as well as regarding PA behavior, such as the distribution of PA according to different domains. Therefore, the present study aims to estimate the minimum number of accelerometer measurement days needed to estimate habitual PA among 6-, 18- and 30-year-old participants, belonging to three population-based Brazilian birth cohorts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study is based on data from three birth cohorts studies conducted in Pelotas (a southern city in Brazil) where PA was objectively assessed between 2010 and 2012. All babies delivered in hospital in 1982, 1993 and 2004 were identified during daily visits to the maternity hospitals in the city (more than 99% of deliveries occur in hospitals). In each cohort, less than 1% of participants recruited refused to participate. All three cohorts have been followed up at different time points thereafter. More details regarding the methodology of each cohort have been previously described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Recent follow-up visits were performed when cohort participants born in 1982, 1993 and 2004 were approximately 30 years, 18 years and 6 years of age, respectively.

Data on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, anthropometry, clinical and biochemical measurements were collected.

The total amount of monitored days varied according to the day of the clinical visit. Participants who visited the clinic either on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays were monitored until the following Monday, whereas those who visited the clinic either on Thursdays, Fridays or Saturdays, were monitored until the following Wednesday. Further information regarding the protocol is available elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Considering MVPA, to represent a week of measurement, three days would be needed for children and four days for adults. Overall PA follows a stable pattern through the week, resulting in a smaller number of days needed to an admissible reliability coefficient, being two days for adults and three for children.</p><p>A better interpretation of our results requires the understanding of the main characteristics of the analyzed PA constructs. For instance, overall PA demonstrates the behavior with minimum arbitrariness, including all daily movement, from ordinary daily life activities to physical exercise. Similarly, light PA as treated in the present study, non-bouted, represents low intensity activities without any duration restriction, but excluding sedentary time and MVPA. Lastly, when using 10 minutes bouts, MVPA estimates attempt to represent structured activities performed for longer periods, such as sports, long periods of walking and running (as exercise), etc. Therefore, it is expected to find different reliability results among the outcomes, once they represent distinct constructs of PA.</p><p>Opposite to our results, other studies have reported differences regarding weekdays and weekend days among children and adults [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This may be due to our specific sample, which includes only 6, 18 and 30-year-old individuals, not an age range (e.g. 18 to 60-year-old individuals). However, it is important to highlight that reliability is not just an age-related phenomenon, it is also a cultural aspect and observed reliability estimates in the present study does not necessarily translate to other settings.</p><p>Most previous studies examining reliability, or other measures to establish the minimum number of measurement days to achieve a desirable reliability coefficient have usually examined different PA intensities such as light, moderate, vigorous or MVPA[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, overall PA assessment is also relevant, because it encompasses all PA intensities with lower arbitrariness, therefore illustrating a continuum of PA [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also, considering the issue of lack of comparability among accelerometry literature, assessing overall PA expressed in raw acceleration (m<italic>g)</italic> can facilitate a direct comparison between studies[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Regarding children, more days of measurement were necessary to achieve reliability coefficient &#x0003e;0.70, for all three PA measures. This could be due to lack of precision related to small sample size in our youngest group compared to adults and to other studies with children. Addy et.al. [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that 3.6 days of measurement would be needed to achieve an ICC of 0.70 among preschool children. Another study, using wrist-worn accelerometers showed a reliability coefficient of 0.8 with two days evaluating adults&#x02019; MVPA[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This evidence shows that many factors could impact on the decision of how many days should be included in accelerometry data analyses, such as: a) reliability coefficient ideal threshold, b) study population, and c) the PA construct of interest.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to consider an accelerometry protocol including at least a week of measurement, in order to guarantee reliable estimates of PA. Evidence from two weeks of adults&#x02019; 24 h-accelerometry-assessed data, shows that seven days are necessary to estimate overall PA, and between six and nine days for PA intensities[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For children, the literature is not consistent on how many days would be necessary for a reliable estimate of habitual PA, ranging from four to nine days[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Also, different protocols are needed depending on the research question. Surveillance studies may be satisfied with only one day of data while studies about seasonality need many days in different periods of the year. Furthermore, the present analyzes are recommended for each data collection <italic>a posteriori</italic>, in order to define the minimum of valid days of measurement in each study, balancing between sample size and reliability estimates[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>We observed no differences in any of the PA constructs between weekdays and weekend days, except for 30-year-old adults, in which MVPA and overall PA levels were lower on weekend days. Likewise, adults presented lower PA on Sundays in the daily comparison analyzes. This may occur due to the decrease in workload and routine activities on Sunday. The Brazilian legislation determines employers must guarantee the Sunday as holiday for most jobs [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] therefore, many people work from Monday to Saturday. For 18-year-old young adults, the analyzes between weekend and weekdays&#x02019; PA did not present significant difference, possibly because Saturday presents similar results than the remaining week, diluting the difference between weekdays and weekend days. Also, children may present different patterns of PA then adults when comparing weekdays and weekend days.</p><p>Addressing the difference between weekdays and weekends for adults (30-year-old adults), can be more complex than simply including Saturday or Sunday in the final measure. As shown in our study, MVPA on Sunday was much lower compared to Saturday and weekdays. This finding indicates a potential dissimilar PA pattern for adults on Sundays, which may lead researchers to rethink data analysis and interpretation in this case. The recommendation to include at least one weekend day in the analysis is frequent in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, it seems to be important to discuss if it would be better to include a completely different day, in terms of PA patterns, in the weekly averages, which would have an impact on the weekly estimates; or to treat this day separately in the analysis. These topics might lead to different methodological decisions depending on the research question and the evaluated outcomes.</p><p>The present study is based on three large population-based birth cohorts born 11 years apart, with objective measures of PA, providing estimates of the number of days needed to obtain a desirable reliability coefficient on different age groups. Also, to our knowledge, this is the first Brazilian study to evaluate reliability of wrist-worn accelerometry-based PA data.</p><p>However, some limitations need to be addressed, such as the decrease in the number of observations when restricting the analyzes to those with six consecutive days, mainly among children. This decrease is due to the use of the non-commercial version of the GENEA accelerometer in the beginning of the data collection. Analyses (not showed here) concluded that such information would not be comparable to the GENEActiv and were not analyzed in the present study. Further explanation on this issue is available in a previous publication[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This decrease in sample size is an example of the issue discussed by Migueles, et al. (2017), that elevating valid week criteria provides greater reliability but may also compromise sample size [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Also, in the present study we did not exclude sleep periods from the analyses, therefore overall PA represents all body movement in the period. This may impact on our results, specially the comparison between weekdays and weekend days, since sleep duration is increased during weekend days[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Lastly, we applied general cut-point thresholds for all age groups since validation/calibration studies of wrist-worn accelerometers are still incipient, which might be considered an important limitation for this area of measurement. In this matter, there is need for more calibration studies and independent validation studies for current available cut-points in order to move towards a consensus[<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Another issue in accelerometry-based literature is the lack of studies in LMICs, where PA practices differ from high income settings [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Also, the improvement of measurement tools for physical activity surveillance would enhance the quality and coverage of physical activity data in LMICs [<xref rid="pone.0216017.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this sense, regarding the generalizability of our results, it is important to keep in mind that we studied a specific sample, including 6-, 18- and 30-year-old individuals. Although our findings are relevant for LMICs settings, they are not necessarily representative of children or adults in general.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that four and five measurement days are needed to estimate all habitual PA constructs, for children and adults, respectively. Also, among 30-year-old adults, it is important to make efforts towards weekend days measurement. However, final decisions on the research protocol of accelerometer data collection should balance according to each research question, available logistic and potential losses of valid days during the process.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>What does this article add?</title><p>Since we found differences between weekdays and weekend days physical activity among adults, it is important to make efforts towards weekend days measurement in order to well represent the physical activity variability across the week. The key finding is that the number of measurement days required to estimate physical activity depends on the age range and the construct of physical activity evaluated, varying between three and five measurement days. When evaluating children&#x02019;s physical activity, there is a need for more days of measurement when compared to adults, regardless of the construct of physical activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0216017.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Median of minutes spent in light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and overall acceleration (expressed in mg) at six, 18- and 30-years old individuals in different days of the week.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0216017.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0216017.s002"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Individual accelerometry and sociodemographic data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0216017.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This article is based on data from the studies "Pelotas Birth Cohort, 1982", "Pelotas Birth Cohort, 1993" and &#x0201c;Pelotas Birth Cohort, 2004" conducted by Postgraduate Program in Epidemiology at Universidade Federal de Pelotas with the collaboration of the Brazilian Public Health Association (ABRASCO).
