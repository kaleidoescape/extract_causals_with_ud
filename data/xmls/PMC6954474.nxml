Increasing studies have shown that interventions targeting impaired autophagic flux can maintain cellular homeostasis by relieving oxidative damage. Here, we investigated the effect of curcumin (CUR), a known autophagy activator, on IDD <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. CUR suppressed <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide- (TBHP-) induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and thereby inhibited human NP cell apoptosis, senescence, and ECM degradation. CUR treatment induced autophagy and enhanced autophagic flux in an AMPK/mTOR/ULK1-dependent manner. Notably, CUR alleviated TBHP-induced interruption of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and impairment of lysosomal function and thus contributed to the restoration of blocked autophagic clearance. These protective effects of CUR in TBHP-stimulated human NP cells resembled the effects produced by the autophagy inducer rapamycin, but the effects were partially eliminated by 3-methyladenine- and compound C-mediated inhibition of autophagy initiation or chloroquine-mediated obstruction of autophagic flux. Lastly, CUR also exerted a protective effect against puncture-induced IDD progression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results showed that suppression of excessive ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction through enhancement of autophagy coupled with restoration of autophagic flux ameliorated TBHP-induced human NP cell apoptosis, senescence, and ECM degradation. Thus, maintenance of the proper functioning of autophagy represents a promising therapeutic strategy for IDD, and CUR might serve as an effective therapeutic agent for IDD.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</funding-source><award-id>2017KFYXJJ248</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>81772391</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Lower back pain (LBP), one of the most common musculoskeletal problems in modern society, is responsible for low life quality and a large economic burden [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The major cause of LBP is widely acknowledged to be intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IDD), an abnormal and cell-mediated response to progressive failure of the IVD due to aging, genetic factors, and various environmental stressors [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, surgery and certain limited forms of conservative treatment, such as good rest and pain relief, are used for IDD, but no effective or constructive drugs are employed in the clinical therapy of IDD [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The IVD consists of three interrelated structures: the gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP), the annulus fibrosus (AF), and the cartilaginous endplate. NP cells play a key role in maintaining the normal structure and physiological function of the IVD by generating the main components of the NP extracellular matrix (ECM), including type II collagen and proteoglycans (mainly aggrecan) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. IDD typically occurs when NP cell apoptosis and senescence levels are abnormally elevated and ECM catabolism exceeds anabolism [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Oxidative stress has been confirmed to be deeply involved in IDD pathogenesis [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It refers to the imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of cells to counteract them through antioxidant defense and can damage lipids, proteins, and DNA [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The pathological factors related to IDD, such as mechanical loading, nutrition deprivation, and production of inflammatory cytokines, can markedly induce ROS production, leading to oxidative stress and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction, which further results in the excessive apoptosis, senescence, and ECM degradation of NP cells [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, comprehensive investigation into the mechanism underlying uncontrolled ROS production and effective interventions against this might not only increase our knowledge regarding IDD pathogenesis but also suggest appropriate therapeutic strategies for retarding IDD.</p><p>Autophagy, which is highly conserved in all eukaryotes, not only is the major intracellular degradation system through which damaged organelles and proteins are degraded in lysosomes but also is an active recycling system that produces materials and energy for the renovation and homeostasis of cells [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The term &#x0201c;autophagic flux&#x0201d; reflects the completion of the entire dynamic process of autophagosome formation and then fusion with lysosomes, subsequent degradation of cargo, and release of degradation products [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Autophagy disturbances are frequently caused by these mechanisms: inhibition of autophagy initiation, interruption of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and damage to lysosomal function [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, autophagy dysfunction has been widely reported to be closely related to cell senescence and apoptosis in the progression of several diseases, particularly degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], IDD [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], neurodegenerative disorders [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and age-related macular degeneration [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Notably, Xu et al. found that treatment of rat NP cells with rapamycin (Rap), a classical autophagy activator, can potently prevent ECM degradation induced by inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and interleukin-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, autophagic flux was also reported to be markedly impaired in rat NP cells under oxidative stress [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, autophagy upregulation coupled with autophagic flux enhancement might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for IDD.</p><p>Curcumin (CUR) is an active polyphenol derived from the dried rhizomes of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, and CUR has been used for dietary and medicinal purposes for hundreds of years in several parts of the world [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Because of its inherent anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and anticatabolic properties, CUR can mitigate the pathogenesis and symptoms of various diseases, including osteoarthritis [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Alzheimer's disease [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, CUR has been recently demonstrated to induce autophagy in diverse tissues, such as cartilage [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], heart [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and liver [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but whether the NP is included among such tissues remains unknown. Given the established link between autophagy and oxidative stress and the ability of CUR to promote autophagy, an enhanced understanding of how CUR affects the NP might facilitate the development of clinically safe, orally available therapeutic agents for IDD.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effect of CUR on autophagy activity, as well as its protective effect against apoptosis, senescence, ECM degradation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in NP cells under oxidative stress. We used <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) to induce an oxidative microenvironment because it offers several advantages over hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), such as high stability and slow release [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, we assessed the therapeutic potential of CUR by using a rat model of puncture-induced IDD, with our aim being to provide novel insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies to inhibit IDD progression.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Cell Culture Treatment Protocols</title><p>To determine the effect of CUR on TBHP-treated human NP cells, the cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations (10&#x02013;25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) of CUR for 24&#x02009;h and then treated with TBHP (50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) for 24&#x02009;h. To evaluate how CUR affects autophagy activity, the human NP cells were either treated for 24&#x02009;h with different concentrations of CUR (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) or treated with 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M CUR for different times (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30&#x02009;h). To examine whether CUR promotes autophagic flux, the NP cells were pretreated with or without chloroquine (CQ; 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) and then treated with different concentrations of CUR (10, 15, 20, and 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M).

When autophagic flux is increased, both yellow and red puncta are increased in cells, whereas when autophagic flux is blocked, yellow puncta are increased but red puncta are not altered.

Effect of CUR on Senescence and Apoptosis in TBHP-Treated Human NP Cells</title><p>Next, the effect of CUR on apoptosis of human NP cells exposed to TBHP was assessed through Annexin V-APC/7-AAD staining. TBHP treatment significantly increased the incidence of NP cell apoptosis, whereas CUR pretreatment rescued this TBHP-induced increase of apoptosis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>). Moreover, we used western blotting to measure mitochondrial pathway apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and cytochrome c) in human NP cells; this is because NP cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress is reported to be mediated at least partially through activation of the mitochondrial pathway. TBHP treatment increased the levels of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and cytoplasmic cytochrome c and decreased the levels of Bcl-2 and mitochondrial cytochrome c, but CUR pretreatment attenuated these changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(i)</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining further revealed that the level of cleaved caspase-3 was lower in the TBHP/CUR cotreatment group than in the group treated with TBHP alone (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(j)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(k)</xref>). Lastly, the results of senescence detection in human NP cells coincided with the apoptosis results, as shown by western blotting for p16 (a classical senescence marker) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(l)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(m)</xref>), SA-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-gal staining (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(n)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(o)</xref>), and EdU incorporation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(p)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(q)</xref>).

Effect of CUR on TBHP-Induced ECM Degradation in Human NP Cells</title><p>The imbalance between ECM anabolism and catabolism in NP cells and the consequent ECM degradation are regarded as the main feature of IDD. Therefore, we measured the mRNA and protein levels of ECM anabolism markers (type II collagen and aggrecan) and ECM catabolism markers (MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5) in human NP cells under TBHP stimulation with or without CUR pretreatment. TBHP treatment decreased type II collagen and aggrecan and increased MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 mRNA levels (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(f)</xref>) and protein levels (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(g)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(m)</xref>), and these TBHP-induced alterations were partially reversed by CUR pretreatment.

Effect of CUR on TBHP-Induced Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Human NP Cells</title><p>Oxidative stress and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction induced by excessive ROS generation were previously confirmed to play a vital role in IDD progression [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Here, intracellular ROS levels were detected and measured using the fluorescent probe DHE and flow cytometry: TBHP treatment markedly induced ROS production, and this was partially inhibited by CUR pretreatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref>). We also examined the level of MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation that is widely regarded as a marker of oxidative stress-induced cell injury; in TBHP-treated human NP cells, the MDA level was higher than that in control NP cells, and CUR pretreatment partially decreased the TBHP-induced MDA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>). We next examined SOD, a key intracellular antioxidant that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup>) to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is then further reduced to H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub>; SOD activity in human NP cells was significantly downregulated after TBHP stimulation, and this effect was largely prevented by pretreatment with CUR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(d)</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress is characterized by the collapse of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;</italic>m, increase of mPTP opening, and decrease of ATP production. TBHP treatment led to the loss of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;</italic>m in human NP cells, which was indicated by a decrease in the ratio of JC-1 red fluorescence (JC-1 aggregates) to green fluorescence (JC-1 monomers), and, as expected, CUR pretreatment alleviated the TBHP-induced loss of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;</italic>m (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(f)</xref>).

TBHP reduced the ATP level in human NP cells, and this was partially restored by pretreatment with CUR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(h)</xref>). These results suggest that CUR alleviated TBHP-mediated oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in human NP cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. Effect of CUR on Autophagy in Human NP Cells</title><p>As indicators of autophagy, LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and Beclin-1 expression were assessed using western blotting. Moreover, we evaluated the levels of p62, a specific substrate degraded in autolysosomes that is used to investigate the status of autophagic flux. The results showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in the LC3-II/I ratio, Beclin-1 expression, and p62 degradation in CUR-treated human NP cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(d)</xref>). Autophagic flux is a dynamic process involving the formation of autophagosomes, the transport of autophagic substrates to lysosomes, and their subsequent degradation. Because either an elevation of autophagic flux or a reduction of the exhaustion of autophagic vesicles could have resulted in the increased LC3-II levels, we sought to discriminate between these two possibilities and further analyze the role of CUR in autophagic flux: we monitored the LC3-II levels in human NP cells treated with CUR alone or in conjunction with the autophagic flux inhibitor CQ, which suppresses lysosomal acidification and impairs the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Western blotting analysis revealed that CQ treatment enhanced the level of p62 and the LC3-II/I ratio in CUR-stimulated human NP cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(e)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(g)</xref>), and this was further confirmed through immunofluorescence analysis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(h)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(i)</xref>).

Effect of AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 Pathway on CUR-Mediated Activation of Autophagy in Human NP Cells</title><p>To identify the signaling pathway associated with autophagy activation in CUR-treated human NP cells, we performed western blotting to assess the levels of AMPK, p-AMPK, mTOR, p-mTOR, ULK1, and p-ULK1 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(d)</xref>): CUR increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and ULK1 and decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Next, human NP cells were transfected with si-AMPK or treated with compound C, a specific AMPK inhibitor, before CUR stimulation. Western blotting results showed that in human NP cells, both compound C and si-AMPK inhibited the CUR-induced upregulation of AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation and downregulation of mTOR phosphorylation, as well as the CUR-stimulated increase of the LC3-II/I ratio, Beclin-1 expression, and p62 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figured 6(e)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(j)</xref>).

These data suggest that the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway was involved in CUR-triggered autophagy activation in human NP cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>3.7. Effect of CUR on TBHP-Induced Blockage of Autophagic Flux in Human NP Cells</title><p>Changes in autophagic flux were evaluated in human NP cells treated with CUR and TBHP. First, western blotting results showed that TBHP treatment enhanced the LC3-II/I ratio and p62 protein level, which suggested impairment of autophagic flux under TBHP exposure, and, as expected, CUR pretreatment decreased TBHP-triggered p62 accumulation and increased the LC3-II/I ratio (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(d)</xref>). Next, we transfected a tandem mRFP-GFP-LC3 construct into human NP cells to directly monitor the status of autophagic flux. The acidic lysosomal environment efficiently quenches green fluorescence but not red fluorescence, and this leads to the generation of only red fluorescence in autolysosomes but of both red and green fluorescence (merged as yellow puncta) in autophagosomes. As compared with the control group, the TBHP group showed an increase in yellow puncta but not red puncta, which suggested that autophagic flux was inhibited in these cells; however, in the TBHP/CUR cotreatment group, more red puncta and fewer yellow puncta were detected than in the TBHP group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(f)</xref>).

Effect of CUR on Interruption of Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion and Impairment of Lysosomal Function in Human NP Cells Stimulated with TBHP</title><p>The fusion of the autophagosomes with lysosomes is a critical step in maintaining an intact autophagic flux. When we performed double-immunofluorescence staining for LAMP1 (one of the major protein components of the lysosomal membrane) and LC3, we observed that the colocalization of LC3 with LAMP1 was decreased in human NP cells under TBHP stimulation as compared with that in untreated cells; notably, CUR pretreatment rescued this decrease in colocalization, which demonstrated CUR-mediated reversal of TBHP-inhibited autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(g)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(h)</xref>).</p><p>The autophagic degradation and turnover of substrates packaged into autolysosomes is the final step of autophagy. A blockade of autophagic flux has been demonstrated to result from impaired lysosomal function, which is indicated by, for example, the presence of aberrant levels of lysosomal membrane proteins, reduction in the activity of lysosomal enzymes, or decrease in lysosomal acidification. Thus, we evaluated whether the protective effect of CUR against TBHP-impaired autophagic flux was associated with the rescue of lysosomal dysfunction in human NP cells. LAMP2, a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein, is critical for autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagic clearance. Western blotting revealed that TBHP stimulation inhibited LAMP2 expression in human NP cells, but pretreatment with CUR partially prevented this inhibitory effect (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(i)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(j)</xref>). Second, to evaluate the degradation ability of lysosomes in human NP cells, we measured the activity of CTSB and CTSD, which are key lysosomal proteases: CUR pretreatment alleviated TBHP-induced decrease in the activity levels of CTSB and CTSD (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(k)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(l)</xref>). Third, considering that low lysosomal pH is essential for lysosomal enzyme activity, we assessed lysosomal pH by means of LysoSensor Green DND-189 staining; the green fluorescence intensity of this probe increases with the acidification of organelles in a pH-dependent manner. We found that TBHP-treated human NP cells exhibited an elevated lysosomal pH as compared to the control, and CUR pretreatment partially suppressed this lysosomal alkalinization induced by TBHP (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(m)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(n)</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrated that impairment of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and lysosomal function in human NP cells exposed to TBHP can be relieved by CUR.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.9"><title>3.9. Role of Autophagic Flux Restoration in CUR Protective Effects on Human NP Cells Treated with TBHP</title><p>To investigate the potential contribution of improved autophagic flux to CUR-mediated cytoprotection, human NP cells were treated with the recognized autophagy inhibitors CQ and 3-MA or the AMPK inhibitor compound C and then exposed to CUR and TBHP. Moreover, a classical autophagy inducer, Rap, was used to enhance autophagic flux in TBHP-treated human NP cells. As expected, western blotting for LC3 and p62 showed elevated autophagy under Rap pretreatment as compared with TBHP treatment alone (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(c)</xref>). By contrast, pretreatment with either compound C or 3-MA decreased the LC3-II/I ratio and p62 degradation in human NP cells treated with TBHP and CUR, which indicated autophagy inhibition (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(c)</xref>). Pretreatment with CQ effectively blocked autophagic flux, as reflected by the increase in the LC3-II/I ratio and p62 level relative to the corresponding ratio and level in the TBHP/CUR cotreatment group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(c)</xref>). Next, we found that when CUR was added to the medium of TBHP-treated human NP cells, TBHP-induced apoptosis and senescence were suppressed, as indicated by the results of flow cytometry (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(d)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(e)</xref>), SA-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-gal staining (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(n)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(o)</xref>), and western blotting analysis of p16, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and cytochrome c (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(f)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(m)</xref>), which agreed with the results obtained after Rap pretreatment. However, the preventive effects of CUR on TBHP-induced apoptosis and senescence were blunted by CQ, 3-MA, and compound C (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(d)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(o)</xref>). Moreover, type II collagen and aggrecan levels were lower and MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 levels were higher in the TBHP-only group than in the control group. Similar to treatment with the autophagy activator Rap, pretreatment with CUR inhibited these TBHP-induced alterations, whereas CQ, 3-MA, and compound C all alleviated the inhibitory effect of CUR (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9(g)</xref>). Furthermore, CUR treatment ameliorated TBHP-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in human NP cells, which was reflected by a decrease in ROS production, mPTP opening, and MDA level and an increase in <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;</italic>m and ATP content, and this amelioration was consistent with the result obtained following induction with Rap (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9(h)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9(m)</xref>).

Overall, these results demonstrated that CUR inhibits TBHP-induced apoptosis, senescence, ECM degradation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction by facilitating autophagic flux.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.10"><title>3.10. CUR Ameliorates IDD Development in a Rat Model In Vivo</title><p>Considering all the experimental results obtained <italic>in vitro</italic>, we constructed a needle puncture-induced IDD model in rats to investigate the therapeutic effect of CUR on IDD <italic>in vivo</italic>. The level of IDD was measured using MRI and was evaluated based on Pfirrmann MRI grade scores. The MRI results showed that T2-weighted signal intensities were higher in the CUR treatment group than in the IDD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10(a)</xref>), whereas the Pfirrmann MRI grade scores were lower in the CUR group than in the IDD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10(d)</xref>). Next, we assessed the histomorphological changes in the IVD tissues in the rat model by using HE and SO staining (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10(c)</xref>): In the control group, the oval-shaped NP constituted a large volume of the disc in the midsagittal cross-section, as confirmed by HE staining, and the NP area contained a large amount of glycosaminoglycan, as indicated by strong SO staining. The star-shaped cells in the NP area were evenly distributed and surrounded by an abundant ECM. Relative to the control group, the IDD group showed a collapse of the disc height together with notable fibrous-tissue invasion. After CUR treatment, the loss of NP tissue and the destruction of disc structure were alleviated as compared with the effects observed in the IDD group. The histological score also indicated the CUR protection against IDD development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10(e)</xref>). Western blotting results showed that CUR treatment increased the levels of type II collagen and aggrecan and the ratio of LC3-II/I and decreased the levels of cleaved caspase-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, and p62 compared to the IDD group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10(f)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10(h)</xref>), and immunohistochemical staining results for type II collagen, MMP-13, cleaved caspase-3, LC3, and p62 were consistent with western blotting results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10(i)</xref>). Lastly, compared with the IDD group, there was a significant decrease in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in the CUR treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10(j)</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>A global review of LBP prevalence in the adult general population showed a point prevalence of 12%&#x02013;33% and 1-year prevalence of 22%&#x02013;65% [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although LBP early diagnosis and prevention have been improved as a result of extensive research focused on the mechanism of IDD, the current clinical treatment is limited to symptom relief and does not effectively reverse the pathology of IDD, which eventually leads to recurrences of disc disease or loss of disc function [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to identify efficacious drugs that prevent IDD progression by acting on its pathological mechanisms. This study found that CUR can enhance autophagy and restore autophagic flux and thereby reduce ROS in human NP cells and, consequently, inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive NP cell apoptosis, senescence, and ECM degradation induced by oxidative stress. This <italic>in vivo</italic> study further demonstrates the therapeutic effects of CUR on IDD.</p><p>ROS constitute a type of unstable and highly reactive molecules produced by aerobic metabolism and include the O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and hydroxyl radical (<sup>&#x000b7;</sup>OH). Accumulating evidence indicates that degenerated IVDs exhibit an increased level of ROS, which supports the <italic>in vitro</italic> TBHP-induced model used in this study [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Mitochondria represent the main target of ROS attack, and dysfunctional mitochondria are also the main site of excessive ROS generation. This creates a vicious cycle that results in a sustained ROS production that leads to oxidative stress and ultimately cell death [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of IDD. We investigated the effect of CUR on oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by TBHP. As expected, CUR pretreatment attenuated the intracellular accumulation of ROS and MDA, prevented the prolonged mPTP opening, and alleviated the impairment of <italic>&#x00394;&#x003a8;</italic>m, ATP production, and SOD activity in human NP cells stimulated with TBHP. Dysfunctional mitochondria can release proapoptotic proteins to form the apoptosome and to activate caspase cascades for NP cell apoptosis. A decrease in antiapoptotic Bcl-2 levels, an increase in proapoptotic Bax levels, and the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytoplasm are reported to be characteristics of NP cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We found that the level of apoptosis in NP cells was drastically increased when TBHP was applied and that CUR alleviated the TBHP-induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Senescence also plays a key role in the occurrence and development of IDD. With aging, NP cellular senescence appears naturally, but this process can be accelerated by several pathological events, including oxidative stress [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Previous work demonstrated that in a degenerative IVD, NP cellular senescence accumulates and is associated with reduced viability, enhanced catabolic metabolism, increased inflammatory response, and compromised self-repair [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We found that CUR markedly decreased both SA-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-gal activity and p16 levels, which suggests that CUR potently inhibits oxidative stress-induced human NP cell senescence, a finding that agrees with the attenuation of IDD development. The IVD physiological function depends on the molecular composition of the NP ECM, which mainly consists of type II collagen and proteoglycans. Type II collagen provides tensile strength to the disc [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and aggrecan&#x02014;the most common type of proteoglycan&#x02014;functions to enable the NP imbibe water and aids in nutrient diffusion from the periphery by maintaining an osmotic gradient [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A progressive decrease in type II collagen and aggrecan content, which arises due to an imbalance between matrix anabolism and catabolism, is the main pathological feature of IDD [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our study confirmed that CUR corrects the ECM synthesis/degradation imbalance and retains the matrix components by promoting type II collagen and aggrecan expression and inhibiting the expression of the ECM catabolic enzymes MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5; this indicates the beneficial effect of CUR on NP ECM homeostasis under oxidative stress. Furthermore, the results of our <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that CUR treatment ameliorated the needle puncture-induced degeneration of the rat tail disc, which further confirmed the aforementioned results of <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p><p>Autophagy, which means &#x0201c;self-eating,&#x0201d; plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading and recycling intracellular damaged organelles and proteins in response to increased metabolic requirements of cells or to environmental stressors such as starvation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Nondegenerative rat NP and AF cells have been reported to exhibit a low basal level of autophagy, and this autophagy activity is markedly increased in degenerative rat NP and AF cells [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, Jiang et al. obtained an opposite result: Beclin-1 expression and LC3-II/I ratio were lower in the NP cells of patients with IDD than in the NP cells of patients with lumbar vertebral fracture [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, the upregulation or downregulation of autophagy activity during IDD might be related to the functional diversity of autophagy. Moreover, a putative role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of IDD has been suggested in other previous studies [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For example, Chen et al. reported that activating autophagy can suppress the expression of MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 in human NP cells treated with interleukin-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> but that inhibiting autophagy produces the opposite effect [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Miyazaki et al. showed that recombinant human SIRT1 protects against nutrient deprivation-induced mitochondrial apoptosis through autophagy induction in human NP cells [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Collectively, these results showed that by adjusting autophagy activity, the degenerative phenotype of NP cells induced by various pathological factors can be substantially mitigated; this suggests that autophagy in NP cells might represent an effective target for the treatment of IDD.</p><p>CUR is a polyphenol that has been confirmed to exert multiple pharmacological effects in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Intriguingly, CUR has been reported to either promote or inhibit autophagy activity in various cells [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In this study, we found that CUR induced autophagy and enhanced autophagic flux in human NP cells, and we further studied the potential molecular mechanisms by which CUR promotes autophagy. We first focused on the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway because this pathway is critical for the regulation of autophagy activation: AMPK, a key energy sensor, can directly phosphorylate ULK1 (the mammalian homolog of yeast ATG1), which, in turn, initiates autophagy [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]; conversely, mTOR, an evolutionarily highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, was identified to function as a negative regulator of autophagy by suppressing ULK1, and this mTOR action can be countered by AMPK signaling [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. CUR has been reported to modulate autophagy by inhibiting mTOR [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] or activating the AMPK pathway [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Accordingly, our study revealed the involvement of the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway in CUR-mediated autophagy activation.</p><p>The accumulation of intracellular pathogenic wastes due to autophagy disorders has been implicated in the occurrence and development of various diseases, including IDD [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. During the complete execution of the autophagy process, the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes depends on the membrane proteins of the lysosome, and the subsequent degradation of the trapped cargo depends on the activity of lysosomal acidic hydrolases; this indicates that the lysosome is essential for autophagy and that lysosomal dysfunction might result in damage of autophagic flux and disturbance of cellular homeostasis. Recently, Chi et al. showed that the pathological mechanism by which mutations in the LAMP2 gene lead to Danon disease is related to the impairment of autophagic flux and the excessive accumulation of autophagosomes [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Moreover, Li et al. revealed a critical role of lysosomal dysfunction caused by inhibition of lysosomal hydrolase activity in the pathogenesis of cadmium-induced neurotoxicity [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, we found that autophagic flux was perturbed during the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes as well as during the degradation of autophagic cargo in human NP cells under oxidative stress. Notably, CUR pretreatment repaired lysosomal function and autophagosome-lysosome fusion and thus eventually rescued the impairment of autophagic flux by oxidative stress.</p><p>We further investigated the role of autophagic flux in the observed cytoprotective effect of CUR in human NP cells stimulated with TBHP. The beneficial effects of CUR were found to be consistent with those produced by Rap, which is known to inhibit mTOR and thus promote autophagy activity. Subsequently, we used 3-MA, CQ, and compound C to suppress autophagy activity in human NP cells: 3-MA is a selective PI3K inhibitor that mainly hinders the initial stage of autophagy; CQ blocks lysosomal acidification and thereby interferes with a key step in autophagic flux; and compound C is an extensively used specific inhibitor of AMPK. Our results demonstrated that both inhibition of autophagy initiation and impairment of autophagic flux diminished the ability of CUR to protect human NP cells against TBHP-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, senescence, and ECM degradation. Collectively, the findings of this study suggest that the protective effects of CUR on TBHP-treated human NP cells can be attributed to the enhancement of autophagy and the restoration of autophagic flux.</p><p>NP cell apoptosis and senescence and the imbalance between matrix anabolism and catabolism are widely recognized as the main contributors to IDD [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Concurrently, abundant evidence indicates that oxidative stress potently triggers these pathological processes [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this study, we used TBHP to induce excessive ROS production, which resulted in oxidative damage to intracellular macromolecules and mitochondria. Our data further showed that autophagic degradation was obstructed in TBHP-treated human NP cells. Undergraded autophagosomes containing cargo and damaged mitochondria can induce increased ROS production and thus create a positive-feedback loop that leads to progressive cellular injury [<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Clearing accumulated autophagosomes and damaged mitochondria through restoration of impaired autophagic flux would help retain ROS at normal levels and stabilize mitochondrial function, which would ultimately maintain cellular homeostasis. Therefore, in this study, the enhancement of autophagy and the restoration of autophagic flux by CUR might have indirectly played a protective role by scavenging excessive ROS through the aforementioned molecular mechanisms.</p><p>CUR exerts antioxidant effects by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD [<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this study, our results showed that CUR pretreatment reversed the downregulation of SOD activity induced by TBHP. Moreover, the ROS production was partially restored after cotreatment with autophagy inhibitor and CUR. Therefore, these results suggest that the protective effects of CUR on NP cells were at least partially associated with its regulation of SOD activity.</p><p>A few limitations of this study are the following. First, the rat IVD experiences different biomechanical characteristics compared with that of human. More studies using a monkey, goat, or dog may provide further insights. Second, as CUR is a Chinese patent medicine that has many pharmacological effects, the protective effect of CUR on NP cells may be not only through regulating autophagy activity but also through other signaling pathways. Thus, more investigations in the future are needed to specifically investigate the protective effect of autophagic flux restoration in the process of IDD.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that CUR treatment induced autophagy and enhanced autophagic flux through the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway, which protected human NP cells against oxidative stress-triggered apoptosis, senescence, and ECM degradation by alleviating excessive ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1"/>). These effects were limited upon inhibition of autophagy initiation or obstruction of autophagic flux in NP cells. Furthermore, the results of <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis demonstrated the therapeutic effect of CUR on IDD. Our findings suggest that CUR may be a potential therapeutic agent for IDD treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81772391) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017KFYXJJ248).</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>LBP:</term><def><p>Lower back pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVD:</term><def><p>Intervertebral disc</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDD:</term><def><p>Intervertebral disc degeneration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CUR:</term><def><p>Curcumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NP:</term><def><p>Nucleus pulposus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECM:</term><def><p>Extracellular matrix</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AF:</term><def><p>Annulus fibrosus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBHP:</term><def><p>
