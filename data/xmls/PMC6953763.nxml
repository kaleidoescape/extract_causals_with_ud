During brain development, activity-dependent mechanisms are essential for synaptic connectivity formation, and abolishing burst activity in animal models leads to weak disorganised synaptic connectivity. Moreover, synaptic pruning shares similar mechanisms to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), suggesting that the timing of activity may play a critical role in connectivity formation. We investigated, in a computational model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurones, whether the temporal ordering of burst activity within an external driving input could modulate connectivity formation in the network. Connectivity evolved across the course of simulations using an approach analogous to STDP, from networks with initial random connectivity. Small-world connectivity and hub neurones emerged in the network structure&#x02014;characteristic properties of mature brain networks. Notably, driving the network with an external input which exhibited LRTCs in the temporal ordering of burst activity facilitated the emergence of these network properties, increasing the speed with which they emerged compared with when the network was driven by the same input with the bursts randomly ordered in time. Moreover, the emergence of small-world properties was dependent on the strength of the LRTCs. These results suggest that the temporal ordering of burst activity could play an important role in synaptic connectivity formation and the emergence of small-world topology in the developing brain.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>CH was funded through CoMPLEX (Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology), University College London for this project.

For example, small-world network architecture allows efficient integration and segregation of information [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and hub neurones or regions play a key role in carrying information throughout the brain [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This structured connectivity emerges during early human brain development; a small-world modular network organisation with hub nodes can be observed in preterm diffusion and functional MRI, with a significant increase in small-world topology between 30 and 40 weeks&#x02019; gestation [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The major period of connectivity formation and refinement in the cortex starts during foetal development from approximately 20 weeks&#x02019; gestation and continues for the first few years of postnatal life [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. MEG recordings of foetal brain activity and EEG recordings from preterm infants are characterised by discontinuous activity&#x02014;bursts of slow wave oscillations with nested high frequency activity are interspersed within periods of apparent electrical silence [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These bursts can occur in response to sensory stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or following movement [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but the majority occur spontaneously in the background EEG [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Spontaneous bursts are thought to originate from regions such as the subplate [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a transient population of neurones present in early development [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and may also relate to activity in the insula [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Neuronal activity is crucial for connectivity formation [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and blocking or reducing burst activity during critical developmental periods, for example, through removal of the subplate in animal models, leads to abnormal cortical network connectivity, with weak thalamocortical connectivity [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and loss of cortical columnar structure [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The temporal organisation of neuronal activity in early development may also play a key role in connectivity formation&#x02014;rearing fish in an environment with stroboscopic illumination prevents the refinement of retinotectal maps [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and periodic electrical stimulation of the ferret optic nerve results in altered orientation selectivity in the cortex [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, activity-dependent mechanisms at the synaptic level are key to connectivity refinement in the developing brain, and synaptic pruning shares similar molecular pathways with long-term depression (LTD) in the adult brain [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting that the temporal organisation of activity may play a critical role in connectivity formation. Recently it has been demonstrated that the burst activity in preterm EEG exhibits scale-free properties [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and that the bursts do not occur randomly in time but follow a complex temporal ordering, known as long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, in the preterm neonatal brain, the timing of any given EEG burst is correlated with the time of occurrence of all previous bursts of EEG activity [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Whether this correlated temporal structure of the timing of burst activity affects connectivity formation in the developing brain is an important open question.</p><p>Here we consider this question by investigating connectivity formation in a simple activity-dependent neuronal network model of the cortex. Motivated by the excitatory role of GABA within the developing brain [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we consider a model where all connections are excitatory. We assume the cortex is driven by bursts of activity from a non-cortical source such as the subplate [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We compare connectivity formation in a network driven by bursts which exhibit LRTCs, to the network connectivity that emerges when the network is driven by bursts with random temporal ordering. This preserves the inter-burst interval distribution whilst changing the temporal correlations in the ordering of the inter-burst intervals. We also compare with the connectivity in networks driven by periodic bursts. Finally, we investigate the relationship between network connectivity parameters and the strength of LRTCs within the burst temporal organisation. We test the hypothesis that LRTCs in the burst activity of the external input promotes the emergence of small-world connectivity in the developing cortex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>We investigated connectivity formation in directed networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurones. Whilst this work is motivated by the observation of LRTCs in the EEG of preterm infants, i.e. an observation at the macroscopic scale, LRTCs have been demonstrated at multiple levels of the nervous system in adults, including in the spontaneous spiking of individual neurones [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the external input which provides the LRTCs within our model is on the macroscopic scale, with bursts originating from non-cortical sources such as the subplate [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], our focus here is on the effect such macroscopic phenomenon has on connectivity formation at the microscopic (neuronal) scale.</p><p>Individuals neurones in our model received both this external input and input from connected neurones when these neurones fired. To ensure that neuronal firing did not saturate the network or die out completely, synaptic weights were updated according to the number of connections within the network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>), which can be considered a form of homeostatic plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The external input to the network was a bursty input, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226772.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. In all cases the bursts themselves were of a fixed duration and amplitude; differences in the driving input were only reflected in the temporal ordering of the bursts, i.e, in the ordering of the inter-burst intervals (IBIs)&#x02014;the time between the bursts. In the case where the network was driven with burst dynamics that exhibit LRTCs, the sequence of IBIs exhibited long-range temporal correlations with a Hurst exponent (<italic>H</italic>) greater than 0.5. In the shuffled input case, the same IBIs were randomly re-ordered in time, giving a Hurst exponent of the sequence of IBIs of <italic>H</italic> &#x02248; 0.5. Thus, in both cases the external input had the same IBI distribution, but the temporal ordering of the bursts was changed and in the latter case the temporal correlations were lost.</p><fig id="pone.0226772.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0226772.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Network input and burst dynamics.</title><p>(A,D) Networks were driven by a bursty input.

The DFA exponents for the sequences of IBIs in the network firing dynamics reflected those of the corresponding DFA exponents of the external input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226772.g001">Fig 1C and 1F</xref>), indicating that the temporal characteristics of the driving input were transmitted to the network activity itself.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Emergence of small-world topology and hub neurones</title><p>Network connectivity was allowed to evolve during simulations using an approach analogous to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The likelihood of gaining a connection between any two neurones was increased if the presynaptic neurone frequently fired just before the postsynaptic neurone, whereas the likelihood of losing a connection was increased if the postsynaptic neurone frequently fired before the presynaptic neurone. Connections were then lost or gained if this likelihood measure reached set thresholds for gaining and losing connections (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>). Network connectivity was initially random, with 40% connectivity in a network with 200 neurones (alterations to these parameters are considered in the section <italic>Varying network size and density</italic>). As with STDP in the adult brain [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and as similar mechanisms to LTD play a dominate role in neuronal network development [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we initially set depression to be slightly stronger than potentiation. We also modelled alternatives, i.e. equal amounts of depression and potentiation and stronger potentiation than depression, which are described below (see section <italic>Varying the plasticity parameters</italic>).</p><p>With slightly stronger depression than potentiation, and driven with burst dynamics which exhibit LRTCs, the network on average lost connections across the course of the simulation and, although the effect size is relatively small, the normalised clustering coefficient and small-world index increased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226772.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the mean proportion of connections (i.e. the number of connections divided by the number of all possible connections within the network), normalised clustering coefficient, normalised mean path length and small-world index from 20 simulations, which were all driven with external input which exhibited LRTC with <italic>H</italic> &#x02248; 0.7.

Thus, across the course of the simulation a small-world topology and hub neurones emerge.

Whilst the level of activity within the external input across the whole simulation is identical in both cases, we also ascertained that this difference in the speed of emergence of small-world properties was not related to differences in the level of activity of the external input at the start of the simulation.

Therefore, the difference in the speed of emergence of the network properties between the networks driven with external input with LRTCs in the IBIs and the shuffled input is not because the level of input to the network is different at the start of the simulation.</p><p>We chose to compare the network driven by external input which exhibits LRTCs with the case where the external input is randomly shuffled in time as shuffling the inter-burst intervals preserves the other properties of input, namely the distribution of the IBIs, whilst destroying the temporal ordering.

Moreover, network evolution dynamics were related to the magnitude of the Hurst exponent, with a faster speed of emergence of small-world properties in networks driven by external input with higher Hurst exponents.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Emergence of small-world topology</title><p>Starting from networks with initially random connectivity and allowing network connectivity to evolve using a simple Hebbian STDP rule, we observed the emergence of small-world topology and hub neurones. Small-world connectivity has been shown to arise in simple models due to constraints such as efficient neuronal communication and metabolic costs related to neuronal wiring [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and hub nodes can arise through mechanisms such as preferential attachment [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A number of previous authors have also examined more realistic computational models of brain development, including examining axonal growth in molecular gradients [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and neurite branching [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Van Ooyen and Van Pelt showed that a simple model of connectivity formation, with the growth and retraction of circular dendritic and axonal fields based on neuronal activity, results in an equilibrium in connectivity level after an initial overshoot in connectivity consistent with experimental observations [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Meisel and Gross further demonstrated that an activity-dependent model of connectivity formation &#x02018;self-organised&#x02019; to a balanced connectivity level irrespective of the initial level of connectivity [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. More recently, Damicelli et al. found that a local Hebbian plasticity rule allowed a network to reorganise to a modular structure [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, all of these models demonstrate the importance of neuronal activity in connectivity formation.

We speculate that this may be important in development, where quickly transitioning to this type of network will allow for efficient integration and segregation of information in the developing brain. This work was motivated by the observation that inter-burst intervals between bursts of activity in the EEG of preterm infants exhibits LRTCs, with an average estimated Hurst exponent of 0.68 [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Evidence suggests that the subplate provides essential input to the cortex during this stage of development [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] so we made the assumption that the burst dynamics of the external input were from a region such as the subplate driving our cortical network. However, the LRTCs in burst dynamics are also passed to the network itself, suggesting that other models which exhibit LRTCs in network activity may also quickly evolve their connectivity. For example, this type of burst dynamics with LRTCs in the inter-burst intervals can emerge in a system driven with continuous external input in the region of a critical state [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although our motivation for this work comes from observations in preterm EEG, LRTCs in adults have been observed at all levels of the nervous system including in spike timing [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

Indeed, the number of painful procedures an infant receives in the premature period is correlated with altered brain development, including lower white matter integrity, and lower cognitive ability at school age [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

Moreover, the effect was not observed across all parameter choices, for example, with low initial connection density and with low values of the decay constant of the likelihood of gaining or losing connections. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the possibility that the temporal patterning of external input can lead to differences in structural connectivity formation in neuronal networks and therefore provides motivation for future empirical and experimental investigations to further elucidate the role that the temporal ordering of activity may play in development.</p><p>To simplify the model, all neurones within the network were driven by the same external input. Whilst bursts of activity in the preterm EEG known as delta brushes can occur in a diffuse pattern over large cortical areas, this is not always the case, with localised delta brushes also observed [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It would not be realistic to model the whole cortex as being driven by one external input, and a useful extension would be to determine how connectivity changes if neurones were to receive different external inputs. As well as the external input, neurones that were connected to each other received input when these neighbouring neurones fired. To avoid either saturation of network firing or quiescence, the weights between individual neurones were evolved according to the level of network connectivity, which can be thought of as a form of homeostatic plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, a limitation of our approach was that connections could be continually lost (and gained), which can lead to the network forming disconnected components. A possible extension of the work would be to see if maintaining the level of connections within the network, as was done by Damicelli et al. [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (another form of homeostatic plasticity), but allowing connectivity to continue to evolve under the dynamics of the network, would lead to small-world properties.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Summary</title><p>In conclusion, early spontaneous and sensory driven activity is known to be crucial for the development of connections within neural networks. Here we investigated whether the temporal ordering of burst activity within an external driving input affects connectivity formation in a neuronal network model.

We suggest that early brain activity, driven by the subplate, leads, through activity-dependent mechanisms, to a small-world cortical network structure, and that LRTCs may play an important role in this connectivity formation warranting further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Software availability</title><p>All the code for this model can be downloaded here <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/berthouz/BrainDevBursts/tree/1.0">https://github.com/berthouz/BrainDevBursts/tree/1.0</ext-link> [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Neuronal dynamics</title><p>Individual neuronal dynamics were modelled as leaky integrate-and-fire neurones described by the differential equation

The IBI sequence was constructed from a random normal distribution with mean &#x02248; 4.5 and standard deviation &#x02248; 3. This sequence was ordered according the ordering of the fractional Gaussian noise process, generating LRTCs in the IBI sequence.

This input was constructed by randomly shuffling the IBIs from the original external input. In this way the two inputs are identical in terms of the distribution of the IBIs (and bursts are identical throughout) and it is only the temporal structure of the input that is altered. We also compared the connectivity changes in networks driven with periodic external input. For this case the IBIs were all identical and were set to a duration of 4.

This update to the synaptic weights can be thought of as a form of homeostatic plasticity&#x02014;without it the network either stops firing when connectivity falls (the external input alone is not sufficient to make the network fire frequently), or the network starts to fire continually as connectivity is increased. Using this approach, the average levels of activity in the network were maintained across the course of the simulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Estimation of the Hurst exponent</title><p>The presence of LRTCs in data can be determined through estimation of the Hurst exponent, <italic>H</italic>.

A Hurst exponent of 0.5 &#x0003c; <italic>H</italic> &#x0003c; 1 indicates that the data exhibits LRTCs. Here we estimated the Hurst exponent using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] which calculates the exponent as the slope of the line of best-fit of the average root-mean-square fluctuations across different box sizes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226772.g001">Fig 1C</xref> for an example plot and <italic>Peng et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] for detailed methodology). Briefly, the signal is first integrated and then divided into boxes of equal length, <italic>n</italic>. For each box a least-squares fit to the data is found and the integrated signal is detrended by subtracting this local trend. The root mean square fluctuation, <italic>F</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) is calculated and the process is repeated for different box sizes and the average fluctuation is compared to box size on a double logairthmic plot. The minimum box size was set to 5 IBIs and the maximum to one tenth of the length of the IBI sequence (the recommended maximum window size [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]). This approach has been used by a number of previous authors to determine the presence of LRTCs in data, including neurophysiological data sets [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. As the external input was constructed to have true LRTCs, and these will not be contaminated by noise, it is reasonable to use DFA to calculate a single linear fit to the data. However, in the absence of such prior knowledge, it is more robust to to use maximum likelihood techniques along with model selection methods [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>To examine network firing and periods of activity/inactivity within the network dynamics itself we separated activity using the method of Benayoun et al.

Briefly, two consecutive spikes within a network are separated as distinct bursts if the time difference between them is greater than the average time, <italic>dt</italic>, between consecutive spikes within the total simulation. Thus, a single burst consists of consecutive spikes which are less than <italic>dt</italic> apart. Benayoun et al. used this approach to define avalanches&#x02014;cascades of network activity&#x02014;which have periods of separation between them. In this way, avalanches are the same as bursts of activity and so the same approach can be used to determine the bursts here. However, it is worth noting that the term neuronal avalanche is used to define specifically bursts of activity within a network where the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power-law [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>The average IBI within the network was lower than the average IBI within the external input.

Firstly, the proportion of connections in the network (the number of connections divided by the number of all possible connections within the network) was used as a straight forward measure to compare whether there were differences in the evolution of the network with different types of the external input. To analyse network topological properties we examined the mean path length and the clustering coefficient of the network. Given any two neurones (or, more generally, nodes within a graph) the shortest path length is the shortest distance needed to be traversed to pass from one node to the other. As we set all the synaptic weights as equal, the shortest path length is equivalent to the lowest number of connections between two neurones. The mean path length is then calculated as the average path length for all pairs of neurones within the network [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Given two neurones both connected to a third neurone, the clustering coefficient indicates the likelihood that these two neurones are themselves connected [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. A random network has a low mean path length and a low clustering coefficient [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. A number of studies have shown that the neural networks have a similar mean path length to a random network (of the same size and density) but are much more clustered indicating that the brain is a small-world network [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226772.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].

Random networks were constructed in this way for comparison every 100,000 simulation steps (at the same points as the network clustering coefficient and mean path length were calculated). The clustering coefficient and mean path length of a network from the simulations were then normalised by dividing by the average values from the random networks to obtain the normalised clustering coefficient and normalised mean path length respectively. From these values the small-world index can be calculated [<xref rid="pone.0226772.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]:
