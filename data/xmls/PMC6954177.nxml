However, clonal kinetics and transcriptional programs that regulate the fate of CAR-T cells after infusion remain poorly understood. Here we perform TCRB sequencing, integration site analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells from infusion products (IPs) and blood of patients undergoing CD19 CAR-T immunotherapy. TCRB sequencing shows that clonal diversity of CAR-T cells is highest in the IPs and declines following infusion. We observe clones that display distinct patterns of clonal kinetics, making variable contributions to the CAR-T cell pool after infusion. Although integration site does not appear to be a key driver of clonal kinetics, scRNA-seq demonstrates that clones that expand after infusion mainly originate from infused clusters with higher expression of cytotoxicity and proliferation genes. Thus, we uncover transcriptional programs associated with CAR-T cell behavior after infusion.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Understanding factors that impact CAR T cell expansion in the clinic is crucial to improving its therapeutic success.

In vivo CAR-T cell proliferation after infusion is important for anti-tumor efficacy and may depend on several factors including the design of the CAR construct, the quality of T cells for CAR T manufacturing, the manufacturing process, the lymphodepletion regimen, infused cell phenotype, and the tumor burden and tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Despite the importance of in vivo CAR-T cell expansion to clinical response and toxicities of CAR-T cell therapy, little is known about the clonal composition of CAR-T cells in the infusion product (IP), how clonal composition of CAR-T cells changes in the recipient after adoptive transfer, and how distinct transcriptional signatures in the CAR-T IP might affect cell fate in vivo.</p><p id="Par4">We previously reported in a small subset of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that CAR-T cells were polyclonal, both in the IP and at the peak of expansion in the recipient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

These highly disparate patterns suggest variability in the clonal composition of infused CAR-T cells and potential differences in the ability of individual CAR-T cell clones to expand after adoptive transfer. Thus, we examine the T cell receptor beta (TCRB) repertoire and lentiviral integration sites of CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells isolated from the IP and from blood of patients treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T cell immunotherapy. We find distinct patterns of clonal behavior that contribute to the CAR-T cell population in the recipient after infusion. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identify transcriptionally distinct clusters of infused CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells that differ in their contribution to the CAR-T cell repertoire in blood after infusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clonal diversity of CAR-T cells decreases after infusion</title><p id="Par5">To better understand changes in the composition of CAR-T cells after infusion, we studied a cohort of patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) who received CD19-specific CAR-T cells manufactured from bulk CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> central memory-enriched (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells, which were infused in a 1:1 ratio of CD4<sup>+</sup>:CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells.

In contrast, clonal diversity remained stable over time in EGFRt<sup>&#x02212;</sup> endogenous CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. As time after infusion increased, the ten most prevalent clonotypes comprised an increasing proportion of the CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cell repertoire (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), demonstrating that decreased clonal diversity after infusion is partly due to expansion of oligoclonal CAR-T cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>CAR-T cells display different clonal kinetics after infusion</title><p id="Par8">To obtain insight into the contribution of individual CAR-T cell clones in the IP to the in vivo CAR-T cell pool, we first determined whether the ten most prevalent clonotypes in the IP remained dominant after infusion.

In other patients, both the rank and relative frequency of many of the top ten clonotypes decreased considerably after infusion, suggesting that not all prevalent clonotypes in the IP will contribute to the CAR-T cell pool after infusion.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Rank and relative frequency of the top ten clonotypes in the IP can change after infusion.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The rank of the top ten CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cell clonotypes in the IP were tracked over time and shown at the early and late time points.

Several of the top ten clonotypes from the early and late time points originated from low-ranking clonotypes in the IPs whose relative frequency greatly increased after infusion. Interestingly, the top ten clonotypes from the early time point generally remained among the top ten clonotypes at the late time point in most patients, except in NHL-1, NHL-3, and NHL-5.

Therefore, we examined the absolute count of individual CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cell clones in blood and observed three patterns of clonal kinetics through the first 30 days after infusion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We observed clones whose absolute counts in blood progressively increased, clones that exhibited an early and transient increase followed by a subsequent decrease, and clones that progressively decreased after infusion. We did not identify correlations between the clinical characteristics and patterns of CAR-T cell clonal kinetics. The data indicates that after infusion of a CAR-T cell product manufactured from bulk CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> cells, there are CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cell clones with different kinetics of accumulation in blood or loss from the blood after infusion. This could reflect cell intrinsic differences in their capacity to proliferate, survive, or migrate to tissues, or different levels of CAR expression on individual cells that may dictate whether a cell is capable of recognizing tumor targets and the effects of the tumor recognition on cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Integration site is not a dominant driver of clonal kinetics</title><p id="Par11">Vector integration site might be associated with clonal kinetics. Therefore, we analyzed the lentiviral integration profile of CD8<sup>+</sup> CAR-T cells isolated from the IPs and from blood after adoptive transfer in ALL (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) patients. A total of 55,382 unique integration events (sites) were identified across all patients and samples. The observed integration sites were consistent with lentiviral integration patterns previously described in human T-cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Approximately 82.6% of all sites (45,771) were within genes and integration in introns was more frequent than in exons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Consistent with our findings from TCRB sequencing, different clonotypes defined by integration site exhibited distinct in vivo kinetic patterns after CAR-T cell infusion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). We examined whether these changes in clonotype abundance were associated with distinct genomic loci of vector integration. We identified two different groups of integration sites, sites that either increased or decreased in relative abundance by at least 5-fold between the IP and after infusion. Comparison of genes harboring these integration sites revealed enrichment in many of the same biological pathways (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). However, genes in biological pathways associated with lymphocyte activation, T&#x000a0;cell receptor (TCR) signaling, and regulation of type 1 interferon were more enriched among genes harboring integration sites that increased in relative abundance, and genes associated with T-cell differentiation and the cellular response to UV were more enriched among those harboring integration sites that decreased in relative abundance (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
