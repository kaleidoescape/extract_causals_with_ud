Although its histological features are well defined, the clinical etiological diagnosis is challenging because TMA may be associated with several triggers, involving genetic susceptibility [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and environmental factors, such as ischemia, antibody-mediated rejection, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity and infection [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. TMA clinical manifestation is also heterogeneous, varying from life-threatening systemic hemolysis to lesions restricted to the dysfunctional allograft. Therapeutic options include temporary or definitive CNI withdrawal, plasma exchange therapy, treatment of the underlying triggering factor(s), and use of complement system blockers [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Overall, post-transplant TMA has been associated with poor allograft outcomes with up to 40% of graft loss [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Considering the TMA significant negative impact on graft survival, advances in the understanding of its clinical presentation, underlying pathogenesis and prognostic features is fundamental to devise more effective and safety preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Tissues for light microscopy were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin using routine procedure. Three to five-micrometer thick sections were cut from the tissue blocks and stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Masson&#x02019;s Trichrome with aniline blue, and Jones' silver staining.

The extent of involvement of peritubular capillaries by linear deposition of C4d using the monoclonal antibody or by immunochemistry using polyclonal antibody was also recorded and correlated with histology and donor-specific antibody for the diagnosis of ABMR.</p><p>Because morphological features, such as extent of histopathological involvement and presence of mesangiolysis, were associated with native kidney disease severity in patients with HUS [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we hypothesized that TMA histological patterns may have prognostic value. Therefore, TMA lesions were classified into the following categories according to thrombi location: (1) glomerular TMA showing thrombi only in afferent or efferent arteriole or glomerular capillary; (2) arteriolar TMA showing thrombi only in arterioles or interlobular arteries; (3) glomerular/arteriolar TMA, when both glomerulus and arterioles were affected. The probable pattern of injury was also classified as (1) thrombotic lesions, when the only TMA feature was the presence of thrombi and (2) endothelial cell activation, defined by one or more of the following features: mesangiolysis, capillary necrosis, glomerular endothelial detachment, capillary wall thickening (obliterative arteriolopathy) defined as luminal occlusion with mural myxoid or fibrinoid change and thickening of the vessel wall.

Moreover, the usual presence of multiple overlapping triggers supports the hypothesis that, in post transplant setting, several factors can act synergistically to injure the graft endothelium. We also highlight that ABMR is the most important limiting factor for graft survival in patients with TMA.</p><p>The low incidence of post-transplant TMA in our center is in accordance with what was reported in larger series as the study of Reynolds <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Differences in TMA diagnostic criteria- based on clinical, laboratorial or histological grounds- and patients&#x02019; selection- percentage of sensitized recipients and with HUS as cause of primary disease- could explain the wide range of incidence rates seen in the literature. [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The baseline characteristics of our cohort, composed mainly by young and female recipients that received a kidney from a deceased donor, corroborate the results previously published [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that suggest these are risk factors for development of post-transplant TMA. Genetic and hormonal factors could explain the particular susceptibility of these individuals to TMA in an environment with other endothelial aggressors as CNI and ischemia-reperfusion injury. [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] We caution that, due the high proportion of patients with primary kidney disease of unknown etiology in our data, we cannot fully ascertain whether some cases of recurrent aHUS were misdiagnosed as <italic>de novo</italic> TMA.</p><p>In a slim majority of the patients, TMA occurred in the early period, although there was a great variability of time of onset. These findings are in general agreement with the observations of Reynolds <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that shows that, in spite of the fact that the incidence peak of <italic>de novo</italic> and recurrent TMA occurs in the first 6 months, the risk continues afterward. Theses results should be interpreted as an alert that TMA can be cause of allograft dysfunction at any period of post-transplantation. Furthermore, in our cohort, the timing of TMA diagnosis was not correlated to difference in rate of graft loss, in contrast to what published elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Systemic TMA occurred in less than one third of the case, which is consistent with study selection criteria based in biopsy-proven TMA. The presence of hemolysis was not associated with graft failure or worse graft function, likewise the data published by Schwimmer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is unclear whether this is because systemic TMA is associated with more severe dysfunction at the moment of the diagnosis, leading to an earlier biopsy, diagnosis and therapy.</p><p>The evidence of ABMR associated to TMA was less common at our institution, compared to what described in other series (Satoskar <italic>et al</italic>, 55%, Wu <italic>et al</italic> 52% vs. 13%). [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] This can be explained by the low percentage of sensitized and re-transplanted in our patients. Nevertheless, patients who had ABMR were significantly more likely to have graft failure, as highlighted before by Wu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Beyond that, despite the prevalence of pre-transplant AT1R antibodies in serum samples of our patients was similar to what was published in literature, two patients had an ABMR-TMA due to AT1R antibodies emphasizing the hypothesis that these non-HLA (human leukocyte antigen) antibodies may be associated to microvascular inflammation, early acute rejection and allograft loss as previously reported.

[<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. On the other hand, in accordance with what was recently published by Bayer <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the usual presence of multiples conditions causing or precipitating TMA supports the "multiple hit hypothesis" [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] that speculates that TMA is the consequence of the combination of genetic predisposition and several trigger factors/conditions in both native and transplanted kidneys.</p><p>Although eculizumab, a C5-targeted complement blocker, is very promise in prophylaxis and treatment for recurrent aHUS after kidney transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], it was not a therapeutic option in our cohort, since, in Brazil's publicly funded health care system, it is only available for treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] The high cost of medication and need for prolonged treatment preclude the financing of this therapy by the local transplant centers or the patient itself.</p><p>The high rate of renal allograft loss in our cohort is probably related to the unspecific therapeutic approach performed, explained by the unavailability of complement blockers and diagnostic tools for differentiation of the etiologies and triggers of post-transplant TMA.</p><p>Regarding the histological features, the thrombi location had no predictive value for graft failure in our study, which is consistent with the results of Satoskar <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] but is in disagreement with what have been published by Wu et <italic>al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], where the pattern and severity of vasculopathy of TMA were associated to poor allograft outcomes. The presence of endothelial cell activation in the allograft biopsy diagnostic of TMA was also not associated to a higher risk of allograft loss. We hypothesize that endothelial damage probably is a more determinant matter if it occurs in a chronic and continuous fashion as seen in transplant glomerulopathy [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>This study has some limitations inherent to its retrospective methodology, such as rigorous diagnosis workup not always available, selection criteria based on histological TMA diagnosis and small sample sized, that precludes drawing definitive conclusions. Other issue that needs consideration is the lack of complement mutational analysis. However it would be interesting to reveal the individual predisposing factors, current evidence does not support evaluation of the complement system in all patients with <italic>de novo</italic> TMA [<xref rid="pone.0227445.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. On the other hand, our study is the first to relate several clinical and histological features of biopsy-proven TMA in kidney-transplanted patients.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that TMA is a rare but severe condition in the setting of renal transplant, regardless of its clinical or pathological presentation. When associated to ABMR, its prognosis is even worse. It is important to recognize that the lack of a tailored therapeutic strategy, as the complement blockade, partially accounts for the bad outcomes of our findings. Further prospective studies carefully looking at the impact of this treatment are required to test this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully thank the patients and nursing staff who participated in this study.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>TMA</term><def><p>thrombotic microangiopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ABMR</term><def><p>antibody mediated rejection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>aHUS</term><def><p>atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNI</term><def><p>calcineurin inhibitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IF/TA</term><def><p>interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCMR</term><def><p>acute cellular rejection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TTP</term><def><p>thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eGFR</term><def><p>estimated glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CKD-EPI</term><def><p>chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DIC</term><def><p>disseminated intravascular coagulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRA</term><def><p>panel-reactive antibodies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mTOR</term><def><p>mammalian target of rapamycin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AT1R</term><def><p>angiotensin II type 1 receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HELLP</term><def><p>hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HLA</term><def><p>human leukocyte antigen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PNH</term><def><p>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227445.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Noris</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name> and <name><surname>Remuzzi</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>Thrombotic microangiopathy after kidney transplantation</article-title>. <source>Am J Transplant</source>

After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p><bold>The manuscript focuses on a topic of potential interest. There are, however, few shortcomings in the study the authors should address. To mention few of them, i) need to expand more the conclusions; ii) need to discuss about the high rate of allograft loss and potential causes of this; iii) need to include in the method section how the cases are reviewed for the diagnosis of TMA prior to the confirmation by reviewing kidney biopsies; iv) need to include the methods of their search such as "CPT codes" used; v) need to clarify if dialysis was temporary; vi) concern about the statement that their cohort suggest risk factors for development of de novo TMA; vii) need to implement the discussion about eculizumab therapy and its use in Brazil, if any</bold>.</p><p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Nov 16 2019 11:59PM.

</p><p>Dear Academic Editor and reviewers,</p><p>Please find enclosed the corrected version of the manuscript entitled &#x0201c;Clinical and pathological features of thrombotic microangiopathy influencing long-term kidney transplant outcomes&#x0201d;. The answers to the reviewers are disposed bellow.</p><p>1. need to expand more the conclusions</p><p>It is important to recognize that the lack of a tailored therapeutic strategy, as the complement blockade, partially accounts for the bad outcomes of our findings. Further prospective studies carefully looking at the impact of this treatment are required to test this hypothesis. </p><p>This statement was added on &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section.</p><p>2. need to discuss about the high rate of allograft loss and potential causes of this</p><p>The high rate of renal allograft loss in our cohort is probably related to the unspecific therapeutic approach performed, explained by the unavailability of complement blockers and diagnostic tools for differentiation of the etiologies and triggers of post-transplant TMA. </p><p>This statement was added on &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section.</p><p>3. need to clarify if dialysis was temporary</p><p>At the time of TMA diagnosis, 36% of the patients (n=32) were on dialysis. There was allograft loss within the first 3 months post transplant in 13 patients. </p><p>This information was written in &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d; section.</p><p>4. concern about the statement that their cohort suggest risk factors for development of de novo TMA</p><p> We caution that, due the high proportion of patients with primary kidney disease of unknown etiology in our data, we cannot fully ascertain whether some cases of recurrent aHUS were misdiagnosed as de novo TMA. </p><p>We added this caveat on &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section and suppressed the expression &#x0201c;de novo&#x0201d; of the sentence on line 457.</p><p>5. need to implement the discussion about eculizumab therapy and its use in Brazil, if any.</p><p>Although eculizumab was not a therapeutic option in our cohort, since, in Brazil's publicly funded health care system, it is only available for treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The high cost of medication and need for prolonged treatment preclude the financing of this therapy by the local transplant centers or the patient itself. </p><p>We addressed this issue on &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section.</p><p>6. Review Line 71 and Line 510: I would change the verb "prove" to "suggest" in the conclusion.</p><p>Thank you. We changed the verb.</p><p>7. In the methods section, they should include how the cases were reviewed for the diagnosis of TMA prior to the confirmation by reviewing kidney biopsies, and include the methods of their search such as "CPT codes" used or explained how they found/ collected 119 cases with diagnosis of TMA (how was this original diagnosis made).</p><p>And this should be included as a limitation in the discussion part.</p><p>In Brazil or Hospital do Rim, the search for CPT codes is not available. In this retrospective cohort study, we initially retrieved all consecutive unselected reports of renal transplant biopsies from Hospital do Rim database between January 2011 and December 2015. These biopsies were performed for graft dysfunction, new onset proteinuria or delayed graft function from kidney and kidney-pancreas transplanted patients. Of a total of 6886, we selected 119 biopsies whose reports described features of TMA. Final diagnosis was confirmed by one of the pathologist authors (LARM). </p><p>We added this information on &#x0201c;Methodology&#x0201d; section. In addition, we wrote a statement on &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section addressing the possible selection criteria bias as a limitation of our study, since TMA diagnosis was based only on histological criteria.</p><p>8. Please include a copy of Table 5 which you refer to in your text on page 18</p><p>On page 18 line 367, there was a typing error: there is no Table 5. The results are related to Table 4, instead. We are sorry about it.</p><p>9. Additional requirements</p><p>We amended current and reviewed statements about ethics and competing interests in the manuscript and in the online submission form.</p><p>I hope this new version will fit the requirements for publication in PLOS ONE.</p><p>I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Dr. C&#x000ed;nthia Montenegro Teixeira, the corresponding author</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227445.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">RESPONSE_TO_REVIEWERS.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227445.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0227445.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227445.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Remuzzi</surname><given-names>Giuseppe</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Giuseppe Remuzzi</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Giuseppe Remuzzi</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0227445" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
