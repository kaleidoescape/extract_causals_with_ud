The IVF procedure results in a decreased number of received oocytes, a decreased clinical pregnancy and LBR [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The latest meta-analysis performed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) in regards to the efficiency of different protocols of ovary stimulation demonstrates an increased cost-benefit with the usage of low dose stimulation using GnRH antagonists [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. When taking into consideration the need for donating egg cells and different ethical and religious questions that impose themselves, it&#x02019;s clear that there&#x02019;s a need for an additional alternative option that will solve these issues. Therefore, the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is considered as a justified and potentially successful opportunity with which the fertility outcome in PORs may be increased [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>PRP, as a method in many medical fields, has already demonstrated its beneficial effect on tissue regeneration, angiogenesis activation, inflammation control and anabolism [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, there are still insufficient clinical data in the field of ovarian infertility. PRP has been used for the first time as a medical term in 2007 as: &#x0201c;a preparation consisting of concentrated platelets in a limited plasma volume. It is used in various regeneration procedures of surgical tissues, where growth factors from platelets can affect the speeding up of healing and regeneration of the wounds&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Platelets are cytoplasmic fragments of megakaryocytes, which are formed from the bone marrow and are approximately 2 &#x000b5;m in diameter [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Activating the alfa granules from the platelets is one of the most crucial steps which affects the availability of released bioactive molecules, and Ergo, the quality of the PRP. Namely, they contain more than 800 proteins, such as cytokines, hormones, and chemo-attractants of stem cells, macrophages, and neutrophils; these molecules have a fundamental role in the hemostasis and the tissue regeneration [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The method of receiving PRP is simple, minimally invasive and at a low cost. The high concentration of factors of growth and cytokines present in the PRP affects the balance between the anabolic and katabolic process, optimising the tissue&#x02019;s surroundings and favouring the process of tissue regeneration [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>In this pilot study, 40 patients were included. A written consent form was received by all patients. Also, all patients were completely informed regarding the case study and the way of stimulation during our research. Patients were divided into two groups, group A and B. The group A consisted of 20 patients, who received a transvaginal intraovarian injection of autologous platelet-rich plasma, before the commencement of an IVF. The choice of this treatment was made after a clear and thorough discussion with the patient/couple. In both groups, there wasn&#x02019;t a statistically significant difference in regards to age, BMI, hormonal status, number of antral follicles, previous IVF attempts and duration of infertility. Both compered groups were balanced for all basic characteristics, and multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for all known confounders. The timeframe between the application of PRP until ovary stimulation for IVF was 61 &#x000b1; 18 days.</p><p>The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee, and the Institutional Review Board and each patient included in the study signed an informed written consent. The study included PORs who meet at least two of the following three Bologna criteria, published by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in 2011 [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Only women whose partners&#x02019; have normal semen analyses were reviewed [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is important to note that only patients where the IVF process was completed with an embryo transfer were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were ovarian insufficiency due to gonadal dysgenesis and chromosomal abnormalities, immunoglobulin A deficiency, large surgical repairs of pelvic floor leading to the creation of severe pelvic adhesions, the use of anticoagulants, psychotropic medicaments, psychiatric disorders, carcinomas or a history of chronic pelvic pain [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Women with present infection, haemoglobin lower than 11 g/L or platelets lower than 150 x 10<sup>3</sup>/&#x000b5;L were excluded from the study. Patients who participated in the study were aged from 35 to 42.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>According to the classification proposed by Ehrenfest, 4 different types of PRP are defined, depending on the content of cells and the presence of fibrin [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In regards to the Classification of PRP in this case study, it is used as a commercial type of PRP with the lower concentration (2.5 x 3 times) system, Regen PRP, (Regen Laboratory, Mont-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland) [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The process was carried out under strict aseptic conditions as well as optimum temperature regulations, i.e., 21-24&#x000b0;C. PRP was prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s guidelines. In the last step, the volume immediately above the erythrocyte layer was collected. Calcium gluconate was used as an activator. After activation, in a period less than 2 min, approximately 3-5 ml of the PRP was injected into the ovaries under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The intervention was made under propofol intravenous anaesthesia following a protocol set by our IVF department. The whole intervention lasted about 15 to 20 minutes. We used a 30 cm single lumen 17G aspiration needles (COOK/Australia)</p><p>The changes in hormones FSH, estradiol, AMH was closely monitored, both before and after the application of PRP. We observed changes in the number of antral follicles before and after the application of PRP. In both groups, we used the same protocol for ovary stimulation, a low dose stimulation using GnRH antagonists.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Stimulation protocols and IVF procedure</title><p>The ovarian stimulation was performed according to the recommendations of the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A mild ovarian-stimulation protocol was performed in all patients. The protocol used 100-mg/day clomiphene citrate on days 2-6 of the cycle, adding the low-dose human menopausal gonadotropin (&#x02264; 150 IU/d) and an antagonist (Cetrotide 0.25) when a lead follicle was &#x02265; 14 mm. During the controlled ovarian stimulation, we followed a protocol set by our IVF department. We evaluated several parameters such as estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>), number and size of follicles, endometrium thickness and gonadotropins administration with ultrasonography and laboratory tests. When one or more leading follicles reached a mean diameter &#x02265; 18 mm and the estradiol level was &#x02265; 200 pg/ml, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 5 000 IU; Pregnyl, N.V. Organon, Os, The Netherlands) was administered for triggering the maturation of oocytes. Administration of FSH continued up until the application of HCG. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval was performed under short intravenous anaesthesia (Propofol-Lipuro 1%, Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). In both subgroups, transvaginal ovary punctuation followed after 35 to 36 hours of the application of HCG. The ICSI technique was used for all research patients. Embryo-transfers were applied 3 to 5 days later, depending on the condition and the work schedule of the IVF department. The same was performed under ultrasound control. Semen analysis was performed 30 min following liquefaction followed by semen sample preparation by density gradient centrifugation using 90% and 50% PureCeption (SAGE, Trumbull, CT, USA). Embryos were classified according to the scoring system of Hardarson and colleagues [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All transfers were performed under abdominal ultrasonography guidance using an embryo catheter (K-SOFT 5000, Cook Medical, Eight Mile Plains, Brisbane, Australia). Intravaginal administered progesterone (Crinone 8%, Merck Serono, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as the luteal phase support. The pregnancy test was considered positive when positive serum hCG levels (&#x0003e; 30 IU/ml) was detected 14 days after embryo transfer (ET). Clinical pregnancy was considered established when at least one visible sac with heart beating was detected by transvaginal ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis is performed in a Statistic program 7.1 for Windows and SPSS Statistics 23.0.

The mean value of platelet concentration was 226.27 &#x000b1; 82.80/10<sup>9</sup>L. Further analysis was performed to identify factors that might correlate the platelet count in the PRP with the values of FSH, AMH, estradiol and total AFC post-PRP.

For us to make a conclusion that would have significant statistical value, we would need a larger number of studies with a larger number of patients involved.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Prof. Nikola Orovchanec, PhD, MD, kindly performed statistical analysis.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research did not receive any financial support</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Competing Interests:</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tarlatzis</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name><name><surname>Zepiridis</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimbizis</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bontis</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical management of low ovarian response to stimulation for IVF:a systematic review</article-title><source>Hum Reprod Update</source><year>2003</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>61</fpage><lpage>76</lpage><comment>https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmg007 PMid:1263&#x0224e;</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12638782</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
