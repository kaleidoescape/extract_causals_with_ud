The leading causes of death in PWH have shifted from AIDS-related events to serious non-AIDS events, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), liver disease, kidney disease, and non-AIDS-related cancer [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Multiple studies have shown that the risk of CVD is ~2.0-fold higher in PWH versus HIV-uninfected individuals, even after controlling for traditional CVD risk factors, although the underlying mechanisms are controversial [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Methods for assessing cardiovascular risk in the setting of HIV are needed as well as strategies to reduce risk.</p><p>Cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools conjoined from traditional CVD risk factors exist for the general population and have largely been derived from longitudinal cohorts [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These CVD risk prediction tools when applied to PWH consistently underestimate their risk of CVD [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Independent HIV-specific factors, such as exposure to certain ART and inflammatory responses, that likely play a key role in HIV-associated atherosclerosis are not captured in these assessments.</p><p>The effect of ART on cardiovascular (CV) risk is complex with different risks associated with short-term and long-term ART and also risks attributable to different agents. Evidence from clinical trials and cohorts demonstrate that there appears to be a significant benefit of ART associated with reduction in morbidity and mortality from CVD, particularly in the short term [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, despite the benefits of ART, use of some ART agents has been associated with increased risk of CVD, including some ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (lopinavir, indinavir, darunavir) and some nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (didanosine and abacavir [ABC]) [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other ART agents (efavirenz), although not specifically shown to increase CVD risk, have been associated with dyslipidemia [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The tenofovir (TFV) prodrug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has not been associated with increased risk of CVD in multiple cohort studies [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Treatment with TDF has consistently been associated with lower lipids compared with other NRTI-containing regimens in either ART-naive or virologically suppressed individuals [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has a lipid-lowering effect that involves all lipid fractions, believed to be associated with the plasma levels of TFV [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], although the mechanism by which the lowering of lipids occurs is not well understood, and the degree of lipid lowering is lower compared with traditional lipid-lowering agents such as statins. However, TDF has been associated with declines in renal function and bone mineral density (BMD). These renal and bone associations prompted the development of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a novel prodrug of TFV, which enables a lower dose of TFV to be used (either 10 or 25 mg TFV, depending on the regimen, vs 300 mg of TFV in TDF). Tenofovir alafenamide has shown less impact on kidney function and BMD decline than TDF in Phase 3 clinical trials and similar impact compared with ABC [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref>].</p><p>The fasting lipid profiles of ART-naive adults treated with elvitegravir (EVG, E) 150 mg, cobicistat (COBI, C) 150 mg, and emtricitabine (FTC, F) 200 mg coformulated with either TAF 10 mg or TDF 300 mg for 144 weeks have been reported [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Namely, TAF was associated with a larger median increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from baseline (18 vs 8 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). The purpose of this post hoc study was to evaluate the impact of lipid changes on predicted atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk and statin eligibility in ART-naive adults with HIV treated with either E/C/F/TAF or E/C/F/TDF [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><sec sec-type="materials" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study Population</title><p>Studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 were 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international trials comparing initiation of ART with TAF 10 mg versus TDF 300 mg, both of which were coformulated with E/C/F in single-tablet regimens (STRs) [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref>].

The overall cigarette smoking rate within the ASCVD risk group (23.6%) was significantly lower compared with individuals aged &#x0003c;40 years (33.3%; <italic>P</italic> = .0001). At baseline, 18% and 23% of individuals on TAF or TDF, respectively, had a 10-year ASCVD risk score &#x02265;7.5%.

Although a statistical difference was noted by Week 96, the increases in ASCVD risk from baseline to Week 96 were driven by both increasing age and changes in TC and HDL cholesterol. Consequently, by Week 96, the proportions with ASCVD risk &#x02265;7.5% had increased in both the TAF and TDF groups with similar proportions in both (27% and 28%, respectively). Within the subpopulation analyzed for ASVD risk, categorical shifts in 10-year ASCVD risk from &#x0003c;7.5% to &#x02265;7.5% or vice versa were also defined.

Rates of CV AEs were low and similar for participants treated with TAF and TDF, with few serious CVD events occurring in either arm. Using a prediction equation optimized for PWH, the 10-year risk for ASCVD incorporating fasting lipid changes was low in antiretroviral (ARV)-naive PWH aged &#x02265;40 years treated with TAF or TDF [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. There was no difference in the number of participants taking TAF or TDF eligible for high-intensity statin therapy, with approximately 1 in 5 meeting at least 1 category by current ACC/AHA guidelines, a proportion consistent with trends for increasing rates of hyperlipidemia in North American HIV cohorts [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although 20% of subjects overall were eligible to use statin medications, lipid-modifying agents were initiated at a rate of only 4% over 96 weeks during this study. Similar trends have been observed in large clinical cohorts in Western countries [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] despite multiple studies having documented that PWH are at increased risk of CVD. More initiatives are needed to reinforce the necessity of ASCVD risk assessment and implementation of primary interventions, namely, statin therapy, to reduce CVD risk in PWH.</p><p>In both groups, the mean 10-year ASCVD risk scores at Week 96 remained below 7.5%, the threshold above which identifies persons with high ASCVD risk. The overall cigarette smoking rate at 23.6% among individuals included in the ASCVD risk analysis was significantly lower compared with individuals aged &#x0003c;40 years (33.3%), a rate that is more than double the overall proportion of smokers (14%) in the United States [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There were no significant differences between smoking rates among the TAF and TDF groups within the ASCVD risk cohort. Small increases in scores from baseline in both groups were driven by increasing age and shifts in lipid parameters, notably larger increases in LDL with TAF, and smaller increases in HDL with TDF. These mean lipid changes were primarily established by Week 48, with minimal changes from Week 48 to 96, suggesting static ARV contributions after the first year of ART initiation. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate&#x02019;s lipid-lowering attributes, the mechanism of which is unknown, have been consistently observed in studies among virologically suppressed patients, including a randomized double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study in subjects with hypercholesterolemia on stable protease inhibitor monotherapy that showed significant decreases in TC and LDL at 12 weeks after adding TDF/FTC [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref>]. With TAF-containing regimens, the lower dose of TFV delivered abrogates the lipid-lowering effect, and small increases in lipid fractions are observed in PWH initiating TAF-containing regimens. The scale of lipid changes observed on TAF is similar to those observed on non-TDF regimens.</p><p>Congruent to the LDL increases observed with TAF, HDL elevations also occurred at a higher magnitude with TAF compared with TDF, a potentially important phenomenon because HDL levels &#x0003e;60 mg/dL independently reduce risk of CVD [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. High-density lipoprotein is generally accepted to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Human immunodeficiency virus viremia may directly affect HDL metabolism by upregulating cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, which enhances transfer of cholesterol to apoB lipoproteins that promote atherogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The capacity of HDL to increase cholesterol efflux from macrophages is a critical function of HDL and may restrict development of atherosclerosis [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A greater proportion of participants taking TAF, approximately 30%, shifted from a high risk to low risk, or protective stratum of HDL compared with TDF (20%). As a result, the TC/HDL ratios remained virtually unchanged and matched for participants taking either TAF or TDF at 96 weeks. The TC/HDL ratio represents a cumulative index of metabolic abnormalities of an atherogenic dyslipidemic profile that predicts ischemic CVD risk more accurately than others ratios, such as LDL/HDL [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Framingham Heart Study indicates that for men, a TC/HDL ratio of 5 signifies average risk for CVD, with 3.4 indicating approximately half the average risk. Women tend to have higher HDL levels, with a ratio of 4.4 signifying average risk, and 3.3 denoting approximately half the average risk [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For both TAF and TDF, the TC/HDL ratios in our study suggest a similar, lower-than-average, 10-year risk for CVD, with the higher TC balanced by higher HDL in participants taking TAF. However, there is clinical equipoise regarding the impact of therapeutically raising HDL to avert cardiovascular events [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;37</xref>]. Lipid-lowering drug trial data support the approach that LDL cholesterol lowering should be pursued more aggressively when HDL cholesterol is low [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;42</xref>]. In our study, although rates of statin introduction were low overall, there were 2 main criteria that drove statin eligibility through Week 96: the TDF arm had smaller increases in HDL, and the TAF arm had larger increases in LDL.</p><p>The relative paucity of lipid-modifying agents initiated relative to participants on TAF or TDF eligible for high-intensity therapy underscores the imperative for greater scrutiny towards the &#x0201c;statin gap&#x0201d; in the comprehensive care of PWH in the United States. In the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) and HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS) cohorts, this gap&#x02014;the difference between patients indicated for statin therapy by ATP III criteria and actual number of patients prescribed statins&#x02014;stands at 46%&#x02013;53% [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study, which enrolled participants contemporaneously with the NA-ACCORD and HOPS data, the gap was 80% and 79% for participants taking TAF and TDF, respectively. Modeling future CVD burden for PWH from the ATHENA cohort using the D.A.D. CVD risk equation, it has been proposed that CVD incidence will increase by 55% between 2015 and 2030. Monitoring and treatment of dyslipidemia and hypertension will have the greatest impact on averting CVD events (17%&#x02013;20%) along with benefits associated with HIV-specific interventions, including early HIV diagnosis and treatment, and avoiding antiretrovirals associated with increased CVD risk [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This model only accounts for the LDL-lowering effects of statins, and it does not consider the immunologic mechanisms of statins hypothesized to attenuate inflammation and immune activation that may further reduce CVD risk in PWH [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;50</xref>].</p><p>We acknowledge several limitations in our study. This was a post hoc analysis, and the study was not powered to determine differences in CVD risk by randomized drug assignment. Likewise, the actual number of CVD occurrences were minimal in each group, and a 2- to 3-year follow-up may be too short to see any difference in ASCVD. The ACC/AHA 2013 Pooled Cohort Risk Equation is validated for adults aged 40 to 79 years; ASCVD risk was only assessed for approximately one quarter of the study population. As such, TC and HDL values used to calculate risk prediction scores may not be fully representative of comparative mean fasting lipid changes occurring among participants exposed to TAF and TDF. The performance of predictive equations may vary with the primary prevention interventions, and none of the equations accounted for documented statin therapy, although overall statin use was minimal in both TAF and TDF groups. </p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, lipid changes in treatment-naive patients taking TAF as part of coformulated single tablet regimens do not substantively affect the CVD risk profile in comparison to TDF. Although predicted CVD risk was low over 96 weeks, approximately 1 in 5 participants overall irrespective of randomized ART met criteria for statin therapy, yet only 1 in 5 of those eligible were prescribed lipid-modifying agents. Because prediction equations may underestimate CVD risk in PWH, and further research is investigating immunomodulatory features of statins, intensified primary care strategies are required to appropriately identify PWH that could potentially benefit from preventative CVD interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="a1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the patients, their partners and families, and all participating study investigators.</p><p>
