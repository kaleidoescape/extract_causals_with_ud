In yeast, the Rad52 protein mediates DSB repair via homologous recombination. In mammalian cells, despite the presence of the RAD52 protein, the tumour suppressor protein BRCA2 acts as the predominant mediator during homologous recombination. For decades, it has been believed that the RAD52 protein played only a back-up role in the repair of DSBs performing an error-prone single strand annealing (SSA). Recent studies have identified several new functions of the RAD52 protein and have drawn attention to its important role in genome maintenance. Here, we show that RAD52 activities are enhanced by interacting with a small and highly acidic protein called DSS1. Binding of DSS1 to RAD52 changes the RAD52 oligomeric conformation, modulates its DNA binding properties, stimulates SSA activity and promotes strand invasion. Our work introduces for the first time RAD52 as another interacting partner of DSS1 and shows that both proteins are important players in the SSA and BIR pathways of DSB repair.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Czech Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001824</named-content></funding-source><award-id>17-17720S</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Wellcome Trust</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100010269</named-content></funding-source><award-id>206292/E/17/Z</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Program of Sustainability II</named-content></funding-source><award-id>LQ1605</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institutes of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM108617</award-id><award-id>R01CA232425</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">University of Iowa Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center Collaborative Pilot Grant</named-content></funding-source><award-id>NIH P30 CA086862</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>To avoid genome instability, a hallmark and enabling characteristic of cancer (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), cells need to carry out efficient replication and repair when DNA lesions such as double-stranded breaks (DSBs) occur. Many critical players are shared during cellular mechanisms that promote DNA replication completion, mediate replication fork recovery and restart damaged replication forks, and repair DSBs via homologous recombination (HR) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, HR primarily depends on proteins within the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Among all members of this epistasis group deletion of the <italic>RAD52</italic> gene in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> leads to the strongest HR and DNA repair phenotype, accentuating its importance. The yeast Rad52 protein is a recombination mediator as it facilitates nucleation of the Rad51 filaments on ssDNA bound by the ssDNA binding protein RPA (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In mammalian cells, the BRCA2 tumour suppressor protein plays a central HR function by mediating formation of RAD51 presynaptic filament required for DSB repair (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and protection of stalled replication forks (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The human RAD52 protein plays an important yet historically elusive role in DNA repair. Initial characterization identified roles in SSA and second-end capture during RAD51-dependent DSB repair (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Depletion or pharmacological inhibition of human RAD52 has a synthetically lethal relationship with defects in both BRCA2 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref>) and BRCA1/PALB2 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This relationship, however, cannot be fully explained by HR defects alone, as RAD52 does not compensate for BRCA2 deficiency with respect to HR. Moreover, depletion of RAD52 only has a mild effect on HR (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Instead of functioning in HR, RAD52 in mammalian cells is required for the repair (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and restart (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) of stalled replication forks, for mitotic DNA synthesis (MIDAS) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), SSA (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and BIR events (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Additionally, RAD52 plays a gatekeeper function at stalled replication forks where it antagonizes fork reversal by SMARCAL1 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Furthermore, RAD52 has been found to be important for repair of &#x0003e;50 nt repeat sequences that flank DSBs and combined depletion with POLQ cause hypersensitivity to cisplatin and a synthetic reduction in replication fork restart (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Structurally, the human RAD52 protein forms oligomers with an average of seven oligomers (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The RAD52 monomer consists of two domains, an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal domain (NTD) and species specific C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The NTD is involved in DNA binding and contains an oligomerization domain (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), while the CTD harbors RPA and RAD51 interaction domains (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The RAD52 protein harbors two DNA binding sites. The inner DNA binding site binds ssDNA within a positively charged groove spanning the circumference of the ring (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and the outer DNA binding site lies above the inner DNA binding site and binds both ssDNA and dsDNA (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). This unique binding mode may facilitate single-strand annealing of complementary ssDNA (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>The BRCA2 protein functions in complex with the highly conserved, small, and very acidic protein DSS1 to promote the RAD51-loading activity of BRCA2 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Moreover, the binding of DSS1 masks a nuclear export signal of BRCA2 and thereby controls both BRCA2 and RAD51 nuclear localization (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Recently, DSS1 was also shown to promote BRCA2-dependent HR by targeting RPA. It was suggested that DSS1 could mimic DNA and reduce the affinity of RPA for ssDNA, thereby facilitating a handoff of ssDNA from RPA to RAD51 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Despite the newly identified DSS1 interaction proteins within HR pathway, how DSS1 cooperates with multiple genome maintenance proteins in many diverse processes remains unknown. Similarly, the functional relationship between BRCA2 and RAD52 remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we show that the RAD52 protein is a novel interacting partner of DSS1. This interaction changes the RAD52 protein conformation and modulates DNA binding resulting in stimulated annealing and D-loop activities of RAD52. We show that DSS1 acts not only in the BRCA2-mediated HR pathway, but also in RAD52-dependent SSA and BIR repair pathways. We propose that DSS1 and RAD52 function together in SSA but seem to have separate roles in BIR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Protein purifications</title><p>The pGEX-KG plasmid carrying GST-DSS1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) was introduced into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells (New England BioLabs).

DSS1 plays an important role in BRCA2 stabilization (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) and cellular localization (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Therefore, we also tested the effect of DSS1 depletion by siRNA on the HR, SSA and BIR in the presence and absence of BRCA2 and RAD52 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). In the DR-GFP reporter assay we observe that BRCA2 is epistatic to DSS1 as expected supporting their shared function in BRCA2-repair events. Down-regulation of BRCA2 or DSS1 alone showed almost complete elimination of HR (app. 4% or 1% residual activity respectively) without further effect of their co-depletion. We also observe that RAD52 is epistatic to DSS1. Down-regulation of RAD52 exhibited a mild effect with 50% reduction of HR and its co-depletion with BRCA2 or DSS1 led to the decrease in HR efficiency comparable to single depletions of BRCA2 or DSS1 protein alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We have not observed any effect of individual siRNA on cell cycle phase distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>).

We observe that BRCA2 is epistatic to DSS1 in the SSA-GFP reporter assay. While BRCA2-depleted cells showed a 6-fold stimulation of SSA, down-regulation of RAD52 resulted in more than a 3-fold decrease of SSA efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Interestingly, DSS1 depletion led to a small increase (&#x0003c;2-fold) of SSA efficiency and no additional effect was observed in BRCA2 co-depletion, indicating that DSS1 negates the effect of the BRCA2 absence and suggests a role of DSS1 in SSA pathway. These data suggest that in the absence of BRCA2, DSS1 helps RAD52 to deal with the resulting DSB burden channelled from non-functional HR pathway.</p><p>RAD52 was also reported to participate in BIR (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), thus we monitored the effect of RAD52, BRCA2 and DSS1 in the BIR-GFP reporter assays. We found that while BRCA2 was epistatic to DSS1, RAD52 was not epistatic to DSS1 in this assay. We observed that RAD52 depletion decreased the BIR efficiency by half, similarly to the depletion of BRCA2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, S1A). Their co-depletion resulted in almost 10-fold decrease in BIR, indicating that they play partially overlapping roles in BIR. Intriguingly, depletion of DSS1 abrogated BIR to the same effect as RAD52/BRCA2 co-depletion, further supporting its role in both DSB repair pathways. Almost no BIR was detectable upon co-depletion of RAD52 and DSS1, indicating an unknown and overlapping role of the RAD52 and DSS1 proteins in BIR. In conclusion, these GFP-reporter experiments allowed us to determine that RAD52 and DSS1 function in the same pathway in HR and SSA.</p><p>As the depletion of DSS1 significantly influenced the efficiency of RAD52-dependent repair (SSA and BIR), we next monitored YFP-RAD52 foci formation by fluorescence microscopy following treatment with ionizing radiation (10 Gy). While no foci were formed in non-irradiated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, S1C), depletion of DSS1 led to a significant decrease in YFP-RAD52 foci formation, in contrast to BRCA2 depletion (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, S1C). Next, we monitored RAD52 foci formation after replication stress in U2OS cells treated with (2 mM HU) for 4 h. Under these conditions, we observed YFP-RAD52 foci were formed less frequently when compared to IR induced YFP-RAD52 foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C and D</xref>). However, the number of YFP-RAD52 foci was significantly reduced in DSS1-depleted U2OS cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, S1D). Altogether, our cell-based data present for the first time evidence that DSS1 plays an important role not only in HR, but also in RAD52-dependent DNA repair pathways such as SSA and BIR.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>DSS1 directly binds to RAD52</title><p>Next, we tested if recombinant GST-DSS1 protein could bind directly to the RAD52 protein <italic>in vitro</italic> by pull-down analysis.

To determine which amino acids in DSS1 bind to RAD52, we first made backbone and sidechain assignments of DSS1 by using a 220 &#x003bc;M uniformly [<sup>15</sup>N,<sup>13</sup>C]-labelled DSS1 protein (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D and S2A</xref>). These DSS1 assignments were deposited into the BMRB database with an accession number 27475. From these assignments, we found that while most of DSS1 lacks secondary structure, a region involving DSS1 residues F52-K62 form an &#x003b1;-helix in solution (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E and S2B</xref>). Then, we determined the regions of DSS1 which bind to RAD52 by performing binding assays through collecting a series of <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra of 10 &#x003bc;M <sup>15</sup>N-labelled DSS1 in the absence and then in the presence of 2.5, 5&#x000a0;and 10 &#x003bc;M RAD52. The acquired data were then analysed by comparing peak heights that were normalized to the peak intensity in the absence of RAD52 and plotted as an overlaid bar graph as a function of DSS1 protein sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). At a 1:1 RAD52:DSS1 ratio (dark bar), RAD52 binding caused nearly complete peak broadening of the DSS1 backbone amides from E15 to M67, indicating that RAD52 binds to E15-M67 of DSS1 tightly, consistent with the MST binding data. At 0.25:1 RAD52:DSS1 ratio (light grey bar), E20 to W43 of DSS1 are more selectively broadened by the binding of RAD52, indicating that these DSS1 residues are the preferred binding site for RAD52. Interestingly, the &#x003b1;-helix (F52-K62) present in DSS1 in solution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E and S2B</xref>) forms a part of the RAD52-binding site on DSS1, while the N-terminal residues (M1-E14) and the last three C-terminal residues of DSS1 are not involved in RAD52 binding. Moreover, the &#x003b1;-helical structure is consistent with a much larger <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H} heteronuclear NOE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>) and a reduced <sup>15</sup>N T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>) for these DSS1 helical residues, likely due to the restricted motion or ordered structure of this &#x003b1;-helix compared to the rest of the DSS1 residues. Furthermore, the DSS1 residue G29, located in the RAD52-preferred binding site (E20-W43), exhibits a unique chemical shift (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), suggesting the existence of a distinct protein conformation around residue G29. As the RAD52-binding region on DSS1 (E15-M67) is highly acidic and contains seven aromatic residues (F19, F22, W27, W39, W43, F52, Y65), it is highly likely that DSS1 binding to RAD52 involves ionic interactions between the negatively charged residues of DSS1 and positively charged residues of RAD52 as well as hydrophobic interactions between them.</p><p>We have also used EM to analyse the effect of DSS1 on RAD52 structure, however under buffer conditions identical to biochemical assays we observed very heterogenous and dynamic behaviour with no clear symmetry that prevented us from 3D model reconstruction. Nevertheless, 2D class averages of RAD52 and its complex with DSS1 and/or DNA suggest conformation changes upon DSS1 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Taken together, we show that the human DSS1 protein contains an ordered &#x003b1;-helix (F52-K62) in solution and that this helix is involved in binding to the RAD52. We also show that the DSS1 protein is a new high affinity RAD52 interacting partner with 1:1 binding stoichiometry, inducing conformational change within RAD52, and requires E20 to W43 of the DSS1 for the binding.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>RAD52 biochemical activities are modulated by DSS1</title><p>Next, we tested the effect of DSS1 on RAD52-mediated activities monitoring ssDNA binding by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The pre-formed RAD52-DSS1 complex was able to bind ssDNA (15 nM) with higher affinity compared to the RAD52 alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Specifically, while RAD52 alone at 240 nM shows less than 20% binding of ssDNA, over 80% of ssDNA is bound by 240 nM in the RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Moreover, the ssDNA&#x02013;RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 complexes were observed as discrete bands with faster mobility in contrast to the ssDNA&#x02013;RAD52 complexes indicating that the DSS1 interaction increases the mobility of the ssDNA&#x02013;RAD52 complex leading to more defined engagement with ssDNA. To further confirm this effect, we utilized previously described FRET-based assays that monitor the ability of RAD52 to bind and wrap ssDNA around the narrow groove spanning the circumference of the protein ring (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). FRET donor (Cy3) and acceptor (Cy5) fluorophores were positioned at the ends of a 30-mer ssDNA (Cy3-dT30-Cy5). The binding and wrapping of Cy3-dT30-Cy5 around the RAD52 ring bring the two fluorophores in close proximity resulting in an increase in FRET (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The maximum intensity was observed at ratio corresponding to 1 oligonucleotide per 7&#x02013;8 RAD52 monomers. Further, addition of RAD52 resulted in a decrease in the FRET signal likely due to binding of the ssDNA within multiple RAD52 rings. The biphasic shape of the binding curve reflects two different geometries of the ssDNA, fully wrapped around one ring (high FRET) and shared between multiple RAD52 rings (low FRET at high RAD52 concentrations) with two distinct binding affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d1</italic></sub>&#x000a0;and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d2</italic></sub>, respectively) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In the reaction with increasing concentration of pre-formed RAD52 and DSS1 complex at saturating concentration of DSS1 (1:20), we observed three significant changes in the binding curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). First, the maximum FRET signal was reduced from about 0.8 to 0.7. Second, the concentration of RAD52 at the maximum FRET value was two times lower when bound by DSS1. Finally, we observe decreased FRET values at higher RAD52 concentrations. All three changes in the binding isotherm may stem from the change in the binding stoichiometry (<italic>n</italic><sub>(RAD52)</sub> = 5.5 &#x000b1; 0.5 and <italic>n</italic><sub>(RAD52-DSS1)</sub> = 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 monomers per 30-mer oligo ssDNA) combined with the increased affinity of the second binding mode (the <italic>K<sub>d2</sub></italic> is about 14 nM for RAD52 alone and is about 4 nM for the RAD52-DSS1). Interestingly, this phenomenon is ssDNA specific since we only observed very small changes in the binding of dsDNA by RAD52 compared to RAD52-DSS1 complex using EMSA and FRET-based dsDNA binding methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>DSS1 affects the mode of the ssDNA wrapping around the RAD52 oligomeric ring.

Cy3 labelled dT33-mer ssDNA was quickly mixed with increasing concentrations of RAD52 or RAD52-DSS1 pre-formed complex and the time dependence of binding was measured by following the change in Cy3 fluorescence (Figures S4D, E). Evaluation of the stopped flow data shows significant differences between RAD52 and RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 binding to ssDNA. First, RAD52 binding to ssDNA leads to smaller fluorescence amplitude compared to RAD52-DSS1, correlating to lower affinity to ssDNA (Figures S4F). Second, tested proteins also show a change of values from negative to positive and differ in the breakpoint between the values of fluorescence change. These changes could be accounted for possible structural rearrangement or represent the concentration where one ssDNA molecule is bound between more than one ring. Specifically, while RAD52 binding to DNA results in decrease of the fluorescence signal, binding of RAD52-DSS1 complex to DNA show increased signal. Furthermore, this change of fluorescence increases for RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 to positive values between the concentrations of 0.1&#x02013;0.25 &#x003bc;M. In case of RAD52, this point is shifted to higher concentration range (&#x0223c;0.5 &#x003bc;M, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4F</xref>), further supporting the DNA binding-induced changes on RAD52 in the presence of DSS1.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>DSS1 alters engagement of RAD52 with ssDNA</title><p>To monitor the DNA accessibility by nuclease protection assay using S1 nuclease, a single-strand-specific endonuclease we pre-incubated RAD52 or RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 complex with ssDNA and treated with S1 nuclease (0.2 U) in time course. The analysis indicates that ssDNA bound by RAD52 ring becomes completely degraded at 1 hour, while the RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 complex shows almost full protection of the ssDNA from the nuclease degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">F</xref>). This suggests that a conformation change occurs in the RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 complex leading to ssDNA protection. To assess if RAD52 dsDNA binding is also modulated in the presence of DSS1 we performed FRET-based competition assays (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) where RAD52 (8 nM) or RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 (8 nM) bound to Cy3-dT30-Cy5 (1 nM) was challenged with linearized dsDNA (&#x003a6;X174 RF I DNA digested with ApaLI). Titration of RAD52 (8 nM) bound to Cy3-dT30-Cy5 (1 nM) with linearized dsDNA resulted in ssDNA release as monitored by a decrease in FRET signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), with nearly all ssDNA released at 200 nM base pairs of dsDNA. Similar experiment with the RAD52-DSS1 complex displayed almost complete ssDNA release already at 50 nM base pairs of linearized dsDNA, suggesting that DSS1 enhances four-fold the release of ssDNA when challenged with dsDNA. These data were confirmed by measurements of the dsDNA competition using stopped flow, which allows us to observe the ssDNA displacement in time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4G</xref>). RAD52 or RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 complex was mixed with ssDNA and then the reaction was quickly mixed with an excess of dsDNA while monitoring the changes in fluorescence. The presence of dsDNA led to the decrease in fluorescence signal in both RAD52&#x02013;ssDNA and RAD52&#x02013;DSS1&#x02013;ssDNA samples. Again, this change was more evident in the case of RAD52&#x02013;DSS1&#x02013;ssDNA complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4G, H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>DSS1 stimulates RAD52-mediated annealing</title><p>Since RAD52 and DSS1 were both observed to play a role in SSA pathway, we next assessed how DSS1 modulated RAD52 annealing activity.

The analysis of the products revealed optimum of the reaction at 120 nM RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 complex in contrast to 480 nM of RAD52, suggesting that DSS1 promotes the efficiency of the reaction four-fold.

Taken together, our results show that DSS1 stimulates the initial rate of RAD52 ssDNA annealing both in the absence or presence of RPA.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>RAD52 is able to form a D-loop and DSS1 enhances this activity</title><p>To test whether RAD52 can promote D-loop formation, a function that would be required in the BIR pathway, we checked its ability to form D-loops using a 90-mer ssDNA oligonucleotide that is complementary to a negatively supercoiled plasmid. RAD52 or RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 were first pre-incubated with ssDNA and then the plasmid DNA was added to the reaction. Formation of the D-loop structure was observed as an appearance of slowly migrating band in agarose gel that was comparable to the product of the RAD51 mediated D-loop formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). RAD52 shows D-loop formation in a concentration-dependent manner reaching more than 10% yield (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>). The RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 complex was able to form the D-loop even more efficiently with almost 20% yield observed at a concentration of 800 nM of RAD52&#x02013;DSS1, compared to 10% for RAD52 alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>). Similar to annealing, the presence of DSS1 in the reaction decreased the amount of RAD52 required to achieve the same extent of D-loop formation. Specifically, to reach 15% D-loop efficiency four times more RAD52 protein is required compared to the complex with DSS1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). These results demonstrate the ability of RAD52 to form D-loops providing key activity for RAD51-independent BIR pathway. Furthermore, this activity is stimulated by the DSS1 protein correspondingly to the phenotypes observed in our GFP-reporter BIR assays.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Exploitation of the synthetic lethal relationship between defects in BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumour suppressors and with RAD52 depletion or inhibition (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) has opened many new questions into the role of the RAD52 protein in genome maintenance. As the depletion of RAD52 in mammalian cells did not show any severe phenotypes initially (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), for decades it was believed that the role of RAD52 was only minor with BRCA2 serving as the main recombination mediator for HR. During a protein-protein interaction screen among varying HR proteins, we observed that the small and highly acidic protein DSS1 interacts with the RAD52 protein. This was an interesting discovery, since DSS1 was previously identified as an interacting partner of BRCA2 that is necessary for the proper activity of this main mammalian recombination mediator protein (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to explore the role of the DSS1 interaction with RAD52 protein. We found that RAD52 foci are perturbed when DSS1 is depleted in cells treated with IR and HU. To determine how complex formation between RAD52 and DSS1 affects repair outcomes in mammalian cells, we utilized the I-SceI inducible GFP-reporter assays (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Not surprisingly, BRCA2 depletion increased SSA indicating that the DSB load is being redirected towards SSA pathway. On the other hand, DSS1 depletion, despite similar HR inactivation as the absence of BRCA2, shows only a small SSA increase indicating that it likely helps RAD52 to deal with the DSB burden corroborating direct role of DSS1 in this pathway. This is further supported by the suppression of SSA levels in co-depletion of DSS1 with BRCA2 and the epistatic relationship with RAD52 co-depletion. Surprisingly, we observed the strongest defects from DSS1 depletion in the BIR reporter assay. Co-depletion of RAD52 and DSS1 show an even further decrease of BIR efficiency compared to the absence of DSS1 alone or BRCA2/RAD52 co-depletion. This could be due to the versatility of the DSS1 interactome, including the recently described interaction of DSS1 with RPA and mediation of the ssDNA handoff with other proteins within its interactome (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). We thus conclude that DSS1 is involved in both BRCA2/RAD51-dependent and -independent branches of DSB repair.</p><p>To understand mechanistically how DSS1 binds to RAD52 and affects RAD52 function we performed a biochemical analysis. We found that DSS1 binds RAD52 with 1:1 stoichiometry with very high affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0223c; 14 nM). Our NMR studies also revealed a tight interaction between DSS1 and RAD52 involving almost the entire DSS1 length from E15 to M67, with the initial preferred binding site in the region E20-W43 of DSS1 and confirmed the presence of an &#x003b1;-helix from F52-K62 near DSS1 C-terminus (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Interestingly, despite the relatively high degree of identity (47%) and similarity (69%) between human DSS1 and its yeast homolog Sem1 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), the RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 interaction is not conserved in yeast. RAD52 was very recently identified in the DSS1 interactome in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), which together with our data opens a question whether the DSS1 protein evolved to serve as a new tool for regulation of conserved, yet not essential RAD52 protein to help promote and coordinate DSB repair in humans. We also performed structural analysis using EM that suggest conformational changes of the RAD52 ring upon binding DSS1 and short single-stranded DNA. However, observed structural heterogeneity, likely due to the dynamic nature of this complex, prevented us from successful 3D classification and auto-refinement, but indicate lack of clear symmetry under the same conditions used for the biochemical studies.</p><p>To assess if DSS1 modulates the ssDNA and dsDNA binding activities of RAD52 several assays were performed. FRET-based biophysical ssDNA binding assays comparing RAD52 and RAD52-DSS1 complexes show DSS1 enhances the binding affinity of the RAD52 ring for ssDNA. This may be due to the ssDNA binding region occupying a larger physical space allowing accommodation of multiple DNA molecules or stacking within the ssDNA and dsDNA grooves simultaneously. FRET-based dsDNA competition assays also suggest the shape of the RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 ring is structurally different than RAD52 alone. Stopped flow experiments and S1 nuclease protection assays support a more complex behaviour in the presence of DSS1. DSS1 also stimulated the annealing rate of RAD52 in gel-based and FRET-based assays. Importantly, this was also observed on RPA-coated ssDNA representing more physiological substrate. These data are in agreement with the proposed <italic>trans</italic> mechanism for RAD52-mediated annealing, where the most efficient search for homology and consequent annealing requires two RAD52 complexes and release of ssDNA from RAD52 followed by dsDNA zippering occurs via successive rearrangement of these complexes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Alternatively, faster or more specific ssDNA binding within the inner RAD52 binding site could promote base pairing by faster movement of the paired DNA to the outer binding site of the RAD52 rings. Another possible explanation for these phenomena could be that DSS1 binding on RAD52 ring could lead to the switch from a <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic> SSA mechanism in which the complementary ssDNA strands bind and anneal on a single RAD52 ring (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Combining our results with previous findings, we propose a model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), where DSBs or stalled replication forks are resected by the MRE11 nuclease to produce ssDNA required for homology-directed repair. Resection generates long ssDNA stretches occupied by RPA (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), blocking the ssDNA accessible for a-NHEJ (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) and promoting recombination repair. In HR, BRCA2 ensures the repair through loading of the RAD51 presynaptic filament and helps alleviate the RPA inhibitory effect. DSS1 bound to BRCA2 and RPA facilitates handoff of ssDNA from RPA to RAD51. RAD52-mediated SSA/BIR represents an alternative DSB repair pathway, where DSS1 seems to facilitate this process via stimulation of the RAD52 binding and D-loop formation activities. However, RAD52 might promote strand exchange reaction by different mechanism then RAD51 or RecA based on its ability to change dsDNA structure, intercalating into the helix to allow base pairing (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of BRCA2, RAD52-DSS1 becomes essential to repair processed breaks or forks via SSA/BIR pathways.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Model describing possible mechanism of RAD52-DSS1 activity in the DSB repair. DSBs or stalled replication forks are resected to produce ssDNA required for homology-directed repairs, alternatively blocked resection allows repair by c-NHEJ. While initial small resection makes DNA ends available for a-NHEJ, extensive resection generates long ssDNA stretches occupied by RPA. BRCA2 in the complex with DSS1 helps to alleviate RPA inhibitory effect and load RAD51 presynaptic filament to promote HR. RAD52-mediated SSA/BIR represents an alternative repair pathway, where DSS1 may facilitate this process via stimulation of RAD52 binding and strand invasion activities. Therefore, in the absence of BRCA2, RAD52/DSS1 becomes essential to process breaks/forks via SSA/BIR pathways.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkz1052fig5"/></fig><p>The precise mechanism of how RAD52 and DSS1 act in SSA and BIR pathways will require further studies. Several pieces of evidence point out to their important role in these processes, especially in the absence of functional BRCA2 protein. Cancer inactivating BRCA2 mutations are characterized by large tandem duplications and deletions (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) which are typical for RAD52-mediated BIR and SSA repair mechanisms, contributing to rearrangements, fuelling genomic instability and oncogenic transformation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Similar results were obtained for ATM- and POLQ-deficient mice (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>), suggesting that POLQ or RAD52 is predominantly used for DNA repair upon a HR deficiency. This is likely the case as RAD52 and POLQ have been shown to play a role in replication fork restart and at DSB sites &#x0003e;50 nucleotides (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Cells rely on RAD52 also when DNA damage overloads the capacity of BRCA1 and 53BP1 (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) which could explain why the RAD52 gene is amplified in human cancers, and why its inactivation curtails cancer development (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). The absence of both BRCA2 and RAD52 likely results in utilization of resected DSB by a-NHEJ, further fuelling genomic instability. This has been reported in RAD52-dependent progression of pre-malignancy to squamous cell carcinoma where RAD52 depletion appeared to increase genomic instability beyond a manageable threshold acceding the cells to death rather than tumorigenesis (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). In addition, breast cancer samples with low RAD52 expression had more insertions/deletions and fusions (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), supporting the ability of RAD52 to suppress a-NHEJ pathway. Furthermore, DSS1 depletion also rendered breast and myeloma cells sensitive to DNA damage and reduction of copy number alterations (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>), where BIR is implicated among the key pathways in their generation (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Finally, analysis of DNA repair in p53-independent p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1</sup> cells showed that upregulated RAD52 mediated mutagenic DSB repair via SSA and BIR (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). It would be interesting to know if increased levels of DSS1 would phenocopy this behavior.</p><p>Taken together we identified a new DSS1-mediated interaction with another DSB repair factor, RAD52. DSS1 modulates RAD52 activities and adds another mechanistic level of regulation when normal error free repair proteins are not present. The main conclusion from our model is that DSS1-RAD52 interaction could allow rescue for BRCA2-deficiency in cancer cells by promoting RAD52-mediated activities via SSA and BIR pathways. Utilization of various repair pathways corresponds to different genome instability signatures, a hallmark of most cancers, therefore reliance on RAD52&#x02013;DSS1 could represent a promising therapeutic target for killing defined cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>All the relevant data are available from the authors upon request.</p></sec><sec id="SEC6"><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>Backbone and sidechain NMR assignments of DSS1 are deposited in the BMRB database with an accession number 27475.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz1052_Supplemental_File</label><media xlink:href="gkz1052_supplemental_file.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="SEC7"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>
