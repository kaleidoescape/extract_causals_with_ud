The most frequent location of the tumor is the epithelium, and epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the most common form of the disease (approximately 90% of cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Most advanced ovarian cancers are treated with a combination of debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, with cisplatin or its analogue carboplatin constituting first-line treatment. Although a significant proportion of patients initially respond to platinum-based treatment, most of these patients relapse in the next 18&#x02009;months with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30%. This relapse is mainly due to chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential to understand the resistance mechanisms and recover the response to treatment.</p><p id="Par10">In recent years, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have emerged as major drivers of chemoresistance. CSCs are a subpopulation of cancer cells that possess the same self-renewal and differentiation capacities as stem cells, thereby maintaining tumor growth and the ability to regenerate a heterogeneous tumor mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, CSCs have been suggested to be responsible for metastasis and tumor growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been reported that traditional chemotherapy fails to target CSCs, which could account for relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is feasible that the CSCs that reside in ovarian epithelial tumors are not targeted by chemotherapy and are responsible for chemotherapy failure.</p><p id="Par11">The Hippo pathway is a regulator of tissue growth and cell fate that is evolutionarily conserved from flies to humans. This pathway consists of a large network of proteins that control tissue growth during development and differentiation but also in pathological situations, such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The core pathway consists of a kinase cassette that is composed of the mammalian sterile 20-like kinases (MST1/2) and the large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. NF2 (called Merlin in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) is responsible for the pathway activation through MST1/2 phosphorylation. NF2/Merlin is dephosphorylated and inactivated by PP1a, the heterodimer formed by the catalytic subunit PPP1Ca and its targeting and regulatory protein MYPT1. MYPT1 belongs to the family of myosin phosphatase targeting proteins (MYPT) and plays a role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but other functions of MYPT1 have been discovered recently, such as migration and cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The main Hippo core kinase cascade includes the mammalian transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog transcriptional co-activator with the PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). The phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ by the Hippo pathway leads to their sequestration in the cytoplasm and ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">In many tumors, upon Hippo signaling inhibition, YAP and TAZ translocate into the nucleus to promote cell proliferation in cooperation with transcription factors, such as TEAD, SMADs, RUNXs, p63/p73, PAX3, PPARc, TTF1 and TBX-5. These transcription factors regulate target genes that are involved not only in cell proliferation but also in tissue growth, the control of organ size and shape and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In mice, mutations in the Hippo pathway leading to YAP or TAZ hyperactivation cause cell proliferation and promote pluripotency and dedifferentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Accordingly, it has been reported that YAP acts as an oncogene and has been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. When MYPT1 binds to the phosphatase PP1, the specificity of MYPT1 for different substrates increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. MYPT1-PP1 was shown to dephosphorylate Merlin/NF2 at serine 518, thereby leading to the activation of the kinase cascade that leads to YAP/TAZ inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and preventing tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, MYPT1 is a key regulator of the Hippo pathway.</p><p id="Par13">Our work provides a functional link between the resistance to chemotherapy in ovarian tumors and the increase in the CSC pool that results from the inhibition of the Hippo pathway upon <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation.

To this end, we first examined the TCGA database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] for miRNAs whose expression was correlated with that of <italic>MYPT1</italic> in ovarian cancer patients. We analyzed this correlation in either total patients or only those showing deregulated <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression and selected miRNAs showing higher correlation in the second case (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). We found that miR-30b expression, which was deregulated in 10% of ovary tumors, fitted this condition and showed the highest negative correlation with <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.53, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).

To confirm this, we first analyzed the capacity of miR-30b to block <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression by cloning a fragment of <italic>MYPT1</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR containing the putative miR-30b target sequence into a luciferase reporter vector, finding that miR-30b expression lead to a large decrease in luciferase activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Then, we overexpressed miR-30b in three ovarian cancer cell lines (ES-2, SKOV3 and OVCAR8) and measured <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression levels by RT-qPCR. We observed a large reduction of the mRNA transcript of <italic>MYPT1</italic> in cells ectopically overexpressing miR-30b (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). Finally, analysis of the TCGA database showed us that 80.7% of ovarian cancer patients had copy number alterations of the miR-30b gene, being 24.4% amplifications that were related with a significantly higher expression of the gene (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p id="Par35">Then, we examined whether miR-30b expression was related to patient survival. To test this possibility, provided that the databases used above do not contain miRNA expression data, we analyzed the TCGA cohort. First, we corroborated that low <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression levels were correlated with worse survival in this patient cohort (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g). Then, we analyzed the relevance of miR-30b expression for patient survival and found that those expressing high levels of miR-30b showed lower survival probabilities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g). Finally, the combination of both miR-30b and <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression clearly showed that patients with statistically significant lower survival probabilities were those with combined lower <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression and higher miR-30b expression. This suggests that miR-30b could be downregulating <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression and that low <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression leads to decreased survival of ovary cancer patients either by itself or by upregulation of miR-30b expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Decreased <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression leads to Hippo pathway deactivation in ovary cancer cell lines</title><p id="Par36">To gain insight into the molecular mechanism connecting the <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression levels with tumorigenesis, we searched for genes whose expression correlated with that of <italic>MYPT1</italic> in tumor samples from the databases GSE40595 and GSE38666. We found that 7222 and 6197 genes correlated with <italic>MYPT1</italic>, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analyses of these genes showed a variety of enriched biological processes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Dataset), among which we identified some terms related to signaling pathways that are involved in tumorigenesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Dataset). Only two of these signaling pathways were found in both databases: the Wnt and Hippo pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). To determine whether these pathways could collectively correlate with <italic>MYPT1</italic> in tumor samples, we evaluated the correlations between <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression in each database and every gene annotated in these pathways. We found that negative correlations with the Hippo pathway genes were significantly more negative in tumor samples than in normal tissue, which was not observed for the Wnt pathway genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b-c).

To study the role of MYPT1 and miR-30b during ovarian tumorigenesis, we generated three ovarian cell lines, ES-2, SKOV3 and OVCAR8, that were <italic>MYPT1-</italic>depleted (two independent <italic>shMYPT1</italic> constructs were analyzed, but only one is shown in the main figures; see the Additional Files for the results obtained with the other <italic>shMYPT1</italic> construct), expressed miR-30b or an empty vector (EV). Both <italic>shMYPT1</italic> and miR-30b expression led to downregulated expression of <italic>MYPT1</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d-e, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f and Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2a). To assess the activity of the Hippo pathway in these ovarian tumor cells and the effect of <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation, we first measured the expression levels of Hippo pathway genes by RT-qPCR using custom TaqMan Array plates containing probes against Hippo pathway genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f and Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Dataset). We found a general decrease in Hippo pathway gene expression in cells expressing either <italic>shMYPT1</italic> or miR-30b, which was clear in ES-2 and SKOV3 cells but very slight in OVCAR8 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). Notably, the fold-change in expression of these genes was highly correlated between <italic>shMYPT1-</italic> and miR-30b-expressing cells for all three cell lines (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2b), suggesting that the effect of miR-30b expression is mediated by <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation. The lack of effect in the OVCAR8 cell line was intriguing, and we observed a general decrease in Hippo pathway gene expression in EV-expressing cells compared with ES-2 and SKOV3 cells (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2c). Indeed, NF2 expression was considerably lower in OVCAR8 cells than in ES-2 and SKOV3 cells, as determined by RT-qPCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g), confirming the constitutive downregulation of Hippo pathway gene expression in this cell line.</p><p id="Par38">Next, to determine whether the results at the transcript level were related to protein activity, we analyzed the protein levels and phosphorylation status of the main Hippo pathway proteins (NF2, MST1/2, LATS1/2 and YAP) in our cell lines expressing EV or <italic>shMYPT1</italic>. We found that both ES-2 and SKOV3 cells expressing <italic>shMYPT1</italic> showed a less active Hippo pathway with an increased ratio of phospho-NF2/total NF2 compared to those of the EV-expressing cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h and Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2d). Accordingly, the <italic>MYPT1</italic>-depleted cells showed reduced phospho-MST1/2 and phospho-LATS1 levels, as well as reduced phospho-YAP (Ser127) and increased total YAP levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h and Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2a). We also analyzed the levels of YAP and TAZ in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and found that YAP and TAZ localization to the nucleus were increased upon <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2e). These results indicate that the Hippo pathway activity is decreased upon <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation, leading to increased translocation of its transcriptional effector YAP to the cell nucleus. In contrast, OVCAR8 cells expressed minimal levels of NF2/Merlin, even in cells expressing the EV, leading to a constitutively decreased activity of the Hippo pathway and subsequent YAP dephosphorylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h and Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2a). Accordingly, the low level of NF2 in OVCAR8 cells was associated with the specific methylation of the <italic>NF2</italic> gene promoter in these cells (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2f).</p><p id="Par39">Then, to confirm the activation status of the Hippo pathway in these conditions, we measured the expression levels of several Hippo target genes, including <italic>BIRC5, CTGF, FGF1</italic> and <italic>GLI2</italic>.

Accordingly, target gene expression in OVCAR8 cells was higher even in the EV-expressing cells and was not further increased in most cases upon <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation, confirming the constitutive inactivation of the Hippo pathway in these cells. Finally, expression of miR-30b led to similar effects in target gene expression as <italic>shMYPT1</italic> expression in all three cell lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i), reinforcing the notion that the miR-30b effect is mediated by <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Downregulation of <italic>MYPT1</italic> increases tumor growth in ovarian cancer cells</title><p id="Par40">The association of low levels of <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression with poor patient survival prompted us to analyze whether <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation affected tumorigenesis.

We first subjected cells to different doses of platinum drugs to calculate the IC50 in vitro. We found that ES-2 and SKOV3 ovarian tumor cells expressing either <italic>shMYPT1</italic> or mir-30b were more resistant with a 2- to 3-fold higher IC50 for platinum drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin) than that of control cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d and Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3c).

To address this possibility, we treated the cells with different doses of cisplatin or carboplatin to determine the IC50 using two different inhibitors that disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD transcription factors: peptide 17 and verteporfin.

We found that downregulation of the <italic>MYPT1</italic> gene reduced the overall survival of ovarian cancer patients, caused resistance to platinum-based treatment both in vitro and in vivo and led to increased stemness of the tumor cells. This suggests that there is a higher incidence of CSCs with lower <italic>MYPT1</italic> that could account for therapy resistance. Moreover, we showed that this resistance is mediated by the deactivation of the Hippo pathway and that a combination therapy of inhibitors of the Hippo transcriptional co-activator YAP with cisplatin suppressed resistance both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="Par54">MYPT1 belongs to the family of myosin phosphatase targeting proteins (MYPT) and functions as a targeting and regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). MYPT1 plays a role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but other functions of MYPT1 have been recently discovered, such as in migration and cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, a role in cancer has been described for MYPT1, since MYPT1 is inhibited by miR-30d to promote angiogenesis and tumor growth in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Accordingly, we found that <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression is downregulated in human ovarian tumors, and its depletion in ovarian cancer cells and xenograft models promotes tumorigenesis.</p><p id="Par55">We found that <italic>MYPT1</italic> is downregulated in different datasets. We also found that patients with lower <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression showed a significant decrease in the probability of survival in the analyzed databases compared to patients with higher <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). A similarly worse prognosis was identified in patients with higher levels of miR-30b that target MYPT1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g). These results suggest that <italic>MYPT1</italic> could act as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, in our own patient cohort of resistant and sensitive tumors, we found that patients with tumors resistant to platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) showed, as expected, worse prognosis correlating with lower levels of <italic>MYPT1</italic> or higher levels of its targeting miR-30b. This finding indicates a clear correlation between <italic>MYPT1</italic> reduction and resistance to tumor therapy in ovary tumors.</p><p id="Par56">Resistance to antitumoral agents, especially cytotoxicity, has been linked to the presence of CSCs in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It is believed that chemotherapy is effective against non-CSC tumor cells but not against CSCs, which are able to initiate new tumor growth after therapy and promote metastasis. Indeed, highly chemoresistant quiescent CSCs have been identified in human ovarian tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In this study, we show that <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation not only increases the resistance of ovarian cancer cells to platinum-based treatment but also leads to enhanced stem-cell properties. As <italic>MYPT1</italic> is downregulated in many ovarian cancer patients, we propose that the high levels of chemoresistance among these tumors may be due to the increase in the CSC pool due to low levels of <italic>MYPT1</italic>.</p><p id="Par57">MYPT1 has been shown to regulate the Hippo pathway through the dephosphorylation of NF2/Merlin, resulting in YAP/TAZ inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We found that the downregulation of <italic>MYPT1</italic> results in increased NF2/Merlin phosphorylation and, therefore, in a deactivation of the Hippo pathway that leads to increased target gene expression and subsequent tumor growth. Consistently, it has been shown that ILK phosphorylates MYPT1-PP1, leading to its inactivation and promoting tumor progression in breast, colon and prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, the phosphorylation of MYPT1 by LATS1 in HeLa cells could act as an autoregulatory feedback loop for this pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. On the other hand, the platelet-induced activation of MYPT1-PP1 has been shown to dephosphorylate YAP/TAZ in ovarian cell lines, thus promoting the expression of the target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In our study, we observed that <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation resulted in decreased YAP phosphorylation with its subsequent activation, increasing the expression of its target genes. Recently, Zheng and coauthors reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] that a small protein of 73 aa codified by a circPPP1R12a promoted the invasion, migration and metastasis in colon cancer also via Hippo signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This small protein might act as a dominant negative or peptide interfering with the interaction of MYPT1 (PPP1R12a) with PP1 or NF2. These data taken together illustrate the coding potential of regulators such MYPT1 and the Hippo pathway and the strong regulation of this signaling on stemness and, especially, in cancer resistance. It is worth noting that the Hippo pathway has been related to the tumor microenvironment, so that increased tumor stiffness results in a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype in the non-tumoral stroma. This occurs by the extracellular matrix stiffness inducing YAP activation and this in turn leads to a feed-back loop enhancing the CAF phenotype and reinforcing the matrix stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">The Hippo pathway has been previously linked to ovarian cancer through YAP, which acts as an oncogene in these tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, YAP targeting may inhibit all tumors with MYPT1 downregulation. To explore this possibility and with the aim of providing a new sensitization therapy, we performed IC50 experiments in vitro, including combination experiments in tumorspheres. Furthermore, we tested this possibility in tumors in vivo. We found that YAP inhibition results in the increased sensitivity of ovarian tumor cells to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that the deactivation of the Hippo pathway is responsible for <italic>MYPT1</italic>-induced cisplatin resistance. Interestingly, YAP inhibition also suppresses the increase in stemness features that is induced by <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation, thus connecting therapy resistance and ovarian CSCs. Importantly, the in vivo combination treatment with cisplatin and YAP inhibitors is able to decrease tumor growth in xenografts and increase animal survival, suppressing the cisplatin resistance that is induced by <italic>MYPT1</italic> downregulation. These data are supported by the observation that in ovarian cancer patients, resistance is linked to lower <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression and reduced survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">We propose a model in which <italic>MYPT1</italic> acts as a tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer. MYPT1 activates the Hippo pathway, which normally suppresses YAP-dependent target gene expression and prevents stemness. However, the downregulation of <italic>MYPT1</italic> leads to Hippo pathway inactivation, thereby allowing YAP-dependent target gene expression and increasing cell proliferation, dedifferentiation to a CSC-like state and resistance to platinum-based therapies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>j). In these circumstances, YAP inhibition prevents stemness and restores therapy sensitivity. Therefore, <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression could be used as a predictor of the response to treatment in ovarian cancer, allowing the stratification of patients. In addition, these findings have important implications for the treatment of ovarian cancer patients, as they demonstrate the possibility of targeting the Hippo pathway in combination with the use of platinum-derived compounds in patients with low <italic>MYPT1</italic> expression to reduce cancer recurrence and metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec33"><p>
