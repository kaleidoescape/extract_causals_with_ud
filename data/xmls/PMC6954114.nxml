Cancer-propagating cells (CPCs) provide a reservoir of cells capable of tumour regeneration and relapse post-treatment. Understanding and targeting the mechanisms by which CPCs are maintained and expanded in SHH medulloblastoma could present novel therapeutic opportunities. We identified the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway as a potent tumour suppressor in a SHH medulloblastoma mouse model. <italic>Ahr</italic>-deficient tumours and CPCs grown <italic>in vitro</italic>, showed elevated activation of the TGF&#x003b2; mediator, SMAD3. Pharmacological inhibition of the TGF&#x003b2;/SMAD3 signalling axis was sufficient to inhibit the proliferation and promote the differentiation of <italic>Ahr</italic>-deficient CPCs. Human SHH medulloblastomas with high expression of the AHR repressor (<italic>AHRR</italic>) exhibited a significantly worse prognosis compared to <italic>AHRR</italic><sup><italic>low</italic></sup> tumours in two independent patient cohorts. Together, these findings suggest that reduced AHR pathway activity promotes SHH medulloblastoma progression, consistent with a tumour suppressive role for AHR. We propose that TGF&#x003b2;/SMAD3 inhibition may represent an actionable therapeutic approach for a subset of aggressive SHH medulloblastomas characterised by reduced AHR pathway activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer genetics</kwd><kwd>Cancer models</kwd><kwd>CNS cancer</kwd><kwd>Neural progenitors</kwd><kwd>Cancer models</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust (Wellcome)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>091475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basson</surname><given-names>M.

Typical treatment consists of a combination of chemotherapy, surgical resection and neuraxis irradiation, with a cure rate of approximately 70&#x02013;75% in children &#x02265;3 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, survivors of medulloblastoma are left with a host of long-term adverse sequelae, including cognitive deficits, problems with neuroendocrine function and fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These drawbacks to traditional treatment options necessitate more effective patient stratification strategies based on biomarkers that predict outcome and identify specific molecular medulloblastoma subtypes for personalized, targeted therapies.</p><p id="Par3">Efforts to dissect the molecular underpinnings of medulloblastoma have identified four main subgroups - WNT, Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group 3 and Group 4 - with distinct transcriptional, DNA methylation and mutational profiles, and different clinical characteristics and outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These subgroups are associated with different cells of origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. SHH tumours originate from cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GCPs), and display excessive activation of the SHH signalling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The prognosis of SHH subgroup medulloblastomas is mixed, with some patients doing well and others not, suggesting significant heterogeneity within this subgroup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Indeed, recent work has identified SHH medulloblastoma subtypes with specific molecular characteristics and associated clinical features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Independent efforts showed that SHH MBs could be subdivided depending on age and molecular signature. Among these, infant (&#x0003c;3.0&#x02013;4.0 years at diagnosis) and non-infant SHH subgroups are consistently observed, alongside a subgroup of non-infant tumours associated with a particularly poor prognosis, characterized by amplifications of <italic>MYCN</italic> and <italic>GLI2</italic> and loss of function mutations in <italic>TP53</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These molecular signatures have previously been linked to medulloblastomas with metastasis and high rates of post-treatment relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Non-infant SHH tumours without these features are associated with better outcomes (&#x0003e;80% 5-year progression-free survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par4">The <italic>Ahr</italic> gene, encoding the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, has been studied extensively in the context of hepatocarcinoma, immune cell development and toxicology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, where this gene appears to have context-specific roles. In hepatocarcinoma, <italic>Ahr</italic> promotes cell proliferation and tumourigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, while it has multiple roles in the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, activation of the AHR pathway by endogenous ligands has been shown to promote brain cancers by the anti-tumour immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, also suggestive of context-dependent, multi-faceted roles for this pathway in cancer biology. AHR is a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factor which acts as a receptor for endogenous tryptophan metabolites and xenobiotics such as TCDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Upon ligand binding, AHR translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with formation of a heterodimer with ARNT (Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator). AHR-ARNT heterodimers are recruited to Dioxin Response Elements (DRE) in the genome to regulate gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. An AHR Repressor (AHRR) protein can also dimerise with ARNT to competitively interfere with AHR-ARNT complex formation and inhibit AHR-regulated gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Sox2+ cancer propagating cells (CPCs), capable of driving tumour initiation and exhibiting enhanced resistance to cytostatic therapy have been identified in SHH medulloblastoma mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Lineage tracing experiments of these cells demonstrated their capacity for tumour regeneration following anti-mitotic chemotherapy, suggesting these cells are responsible for tumour relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms governing CPC formation and maintenance in SHH medulloblastomas remain to be fully elucidated. AHR function has been linked to CPC and haematopoietic stem cell maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In a recent study, AHR was shown to regulate the balance between quiescence and proliferation in hematopoietic stem cells, with these stem cells becoming less quiescent and more proliferative in <italic>Ahr</italic>-deficient animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Previous studies have implicated AHR in cerebellar development and medulloblastoma cell proliferation. <italic>Ahr</italic> deletion in primary cerebellar GCPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> or AHR knock-down in a SHH-associated medulloblastoma cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> resulted in proliferative deficits. To determine if AHR has a direct role in SHH medulloblastoma <italic>in vivo</italic>, we conditionally deleted the <italic>Ahr</italic> gene in mouse cerebellar GCPs, either alone or in combination with medulloblastoma-initiating <italic>Ptch1</italic> gene deletion. Our analyses of these mice revealed a striking tumour-suppressive role for AHR in mouse SHH medulloblastoma development. We identify a specific role for AHR in regulating the TGF&#x003b2;-SMAD3 signalling axis in CPCs from these tumours and identify a new role for TGF&#x003b2;-SMAD3 activity in medulloblastoma CPC differentiation. Examination of the expression of AHR pathway genes in human medulloblastoma cohorts support an important role for the AHR pathway in SHH medulloblastoma biology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>AHR modulates primary mouse GCP proliferation and differentiation by repressing TGF&#x003b2;/SMAD3 signalling</title><p id="Par7">To investigate the role of the AHR pathway in neural progenitor fate in the developing cerebellum, we conditionally deleted the <italic>Ahr</italic> gene from Math1+ GCPs during cerebellar development. In agreement with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we observed reduced GCP proliferation and enhanced cell cycle exit (as measured by cell Q fraction) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>) of GCPs in <italic>Ahr</italic> conditional knockout <italic>Math1cre; Ahr</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> (<italic>Ahr</italic> cKO) cerebella, compared to control <italic>Ahr</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> cerebella (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b,c</xref>).

A substantial fraction of GCPs displayed positivity for both Ki67 and Neurod1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), which can be expected to occur at 24&#x02009;hours as cells are transitioning from a proliferative to a terminally differentiated state.

This study only assessed SHH medulloblastomas from 35 patients and using nuclear localisation of SMAD3 as a read-out of pathway activation may not be ideal. Clearly, a larger study to assess P-SMAD3 immunoreactivity will be important. Interestingly, elevated TGF&#x003b2; signalling has also been implicated as a driver of Group 3 medulloblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, suggesting that this pathway may also play important roles in other medulloblastoma subtypes.</p><p id="Par27">Our human transcriptomic analyses identified <italic>AHRR</italic> expression as a novel biomarker for aggressive SHH medulloblastoma in two of three independent cohorts investigated. Demographic differences and the mixed therapies deployed within these retrospective cohorts may explain the lack of consistent observations in all three cohorts, and these encouraging initial findings now require prospective validation in clinical trials-based cohorts. Determining to what extent high AHRR expression in human SHH medulloblastoma is associated with elevated TGF&#x003b2;-SMAD3 signalling will be an important next step to identify patients that may benefit from TGF&#x003b2;-SMAD3 inhibition and/or AHR agonist therapies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par28"><italic>Math1cre</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, <italic>Ptch1 flox</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and <italic>Ahr flox</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> mouse lines have been described and were genotyped by PCR using tail or ear DNA extracted using proteinase K digestion or the HotSHOT method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.
