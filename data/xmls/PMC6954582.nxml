These families must cope with experiences of armed conflict and forced migration while also assimilating to a new society. According to the &#x02018;immigrant paradox,&#x02019; time spent in a new country can compound the effects of migration and assimilation challenges and lead to deteriorated mental health. This study aims to assess the psychosocial wellbeing of MENA-born or first-generation adolescents attending school in the Detroit metropolitan area (DMA) to understand how schools, families, and communities play a role in supporting these adolescents&#x02019; wellbeing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The quantitative component of this mixed methods study will involve a self-administered survey with a sample of students whose responses will be linked to academic records and behavioral assessments. The survey will utilize validated instruments to measure depressive and anxiety symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-37A), hope (Children&#x02019;s Hope Scale), resilience (Child and Youth Resilience Measure-12), externalizing and prosocial behavior (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-37A, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), school belonging (Psychological Sense of School Membership), and peer relationships (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support). Differences in outcomes will be analyzed across two strata: students born in the MENA region and first-generation students whose parents immigrated to the US from the MENA region. The qualitative component will involve semi-structured key informant interviews with parents, school administrators, educators, and mental health providers, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with a purposive sample of adolescents born &#x02013; or whose parents were born - in the MENA region. The FGDs will include a participatory ranking activity where participants will be asked to free-list and rank ideas about how schools can better support students like them. Thematic content analysis will be conducted to identify common themes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study will contribute evidence about the wellbeing of adolescents who come from &#x02013; or whose parents come from - conflict-affected countries currently living in the U.S. Findings can be used to inform program and policy development to enable schools and their community partners to serve this population more effectively.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mental health</kwd><kwd>Psychosocial support</kwd><kwd>Youth</kwd><kwd>Acculturation</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Refugees</kwd><kwd>Immigrants</kwd><kwd>Middle East</kwd><kwd>MENA</kwd><kwd>Immigrant paradox</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007458</institution-id><institution>Qatar Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par7">Adolescence is a critical phase of human development, during which physical, neural, and psychological growth are readily influenced by external factors. Experiences during adolescence can have a profound effect on health and wellbeing that last through adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While this developmental period can be challenging for any individual, adolescents who have been &#x02013; or whose parents have been - resettled from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region face a number of unique challenges that may increase their risk of adverse mental and psychosocial health outcomes. Following escape from political conflict and violence at home, forced migrants often endure a multitude of hardships throughout their flight, from a lack of basic resources, to detention, humiliation, and physical and sexual abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Those who resettle in the United States may not only struggle to process their loss of home and experiences of migration, but must also adapt to a new language and culture, and learn to navigate complicated legal and public service systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Further, adolescents coming from conflict-affected settings often spend months or years out-of-school prior to resettlement and may struggle to catch up with their peers academically, all the while at risk of facing routine discrimination, micro-aggressions, and bullying in their new communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Arab immigrant, refugee, and U.S.-born Arab-American adults report higher levels of poor mental health outcomes than non-Arab Americans, including depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, despite the emerging literature on adults from Arab-majority countries, fewer studies have focused on adolescents within this same population. The few studies that have been undertaken have shown that children and adolescents resettling in high-income countries, such as the U.S., tend to be at elevated risk of poor psychological outcomes, such as mood and anxiety disorders, compared to those living in the country of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given the known adversities stemming from conflict, migration and acculturation stressors, these findings may not come as a surprise.</p><p id="Par9">What is perhaps more surprising is that time spent in a resettlement country has been shown to exacerbate these mental health risks, both among immigrant adults and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Within this &#x02018;immigrant paradox,&#x02019; prolonged time lived in the U.S. can result in deteriorated mental health and wellbeing among immigrant children and adolescents compared to first generation U.S.-born children of immigrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. While this finding may seem counterintuitive given the considerable acculturative stress experienced by this population, it has been hypothesized that those newer to the country may fare better relative to those who have resided for longer periods of time due to protective factors unique to immigrant populations, including living in ethnic enclaves upon first arrival to the U.S. Known as the &#x02018;ethnic density effect,&#x02019; this phenomenon has been theorized to contribute to better physical and mental health outcomes among immigrants living in high income countries compared to those living in other areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The available evidence points to several related protective factors for adolescents from conflict-affected countries who have resettled in high-income countries. Perceived community acceptance and support is a critical factor influencing psychosocial health outcomes among this population, together with parental support, family connectedness, and continued links with the cultural and religious practices of the origin country, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The erosion of such protective factors coinciding with increases in &#x02018;acculturative stress&#x02019; can lead to a decline in overall mental health of immigrant adolescents over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Schools in particular are thought to play a central protective role for youth from these settings. For example, studies in the U.S. have found that refugees and asylum-seekers reporting a strong sense of school belonging (or high school social capital) tended to have lower levels of psychosocial distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition to educating students who have been resettled, and connecting them to a broader community of peers, schools can also provide an environment in which families may build new support networks and relationships. For example, the Colorado Department of Human Services recently found that school support contributed not only to students&#x02019; integration, but to the integration of parents as well, with parents becoming markedly more involved in their children&#x02019;s schools over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Practitioners and researchers alike have become increasingly interested in the role of schools in promoting healthy development and improved psychosocial wellbeing among resettled refugees and asylum-seekers, and nascent evidence points to the potential of such school-based interventions in high-income countries.</p><p id="Par12">Within an increasingly hostile political climate, a broader evidence base is urgently needed to develop programs and policies that enable schools and their partners to serve this population effectively. Ongoing conflict in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, contribute to the large number of refugees and asylum-seekers in the U.S. Syria and Iraq, for example, were two of the top five origin countries of refugees and asylum-seekers resettled in the U.S. in 2016 and 2017, together representing over a quarter of new arrivals in each of those years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionally, given the recent influx of Arabic newcomers nationally, it is important to explore the nuanced differences in experiences and psychosocial adjustment among adolescent students, with the understanding that needs may differ depending on where and how long they have resided in the US. To bridge these gaps in evidence and practice, the SALaMA study aims to assess the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of adolescent students from conflict-affected, Arab-majority countries living in the largest Arab ethnic enclave in the U.S., with special attention paid to whether they were born in the U.S or abroad.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par13">This mixed methods, cross-sectional study will take place across three public charter high schools located in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) of Michigan, which has an extensive history of economic and migratory fluctuations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Around 15.6% of the DMA&#x02019;s 4.3 million people live below the federal poverty level with an average life expectancy that is 5 years shorter than comparable populations in other major US cities, including New York City, San Francisco, and Dallas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">This setting was chosen for the present study due to its relatively high percentage of Arab immigrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking students. The DMA has the second largest number of Arabs and Arab-Americans in the U.S., coming second only to Los Angeles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Historically, this area has been a popular destination for MENA immigrants and forced migrants/refugees, with 46% of Dearborn&#x02019;s population identifying as Arab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Cohorts of immigrants and forced migrants/refugees from the MENA region have continually arrived in the U.S. through what are now referred to as the &#x0201c;three waves of Middle East migration,&#x0201d; though the exact time periods that define each wave can vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The first wave arrived in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and was comprised of individuals who largely sighted seeking opportunities for educational and financial success as the primary reason for their migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The second wave arrived post-World War II when the U.S. received a large influx of MENA immigrant and refugee families fleeing conflict and poverty, primarily from Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The majority of these families settled in the DMA mostly due to the abundance of jobs available through the Ford Motor company. This second wave is generally credited as fostering the community&#x02019;s social cohesion and Arab-American identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The third wave comprises those who emigrated primarily from Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula after the U.S. Immigration Act was enacted in 1965 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This wave is considered to have had the largest number of MENA migrants, especially with the onset of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, the Gulf War of 1991, and subsequent invasions of Iraq and Syria post-September 11th [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Migrants in this wave tended to join their families who had migrated in previous waves, leading to a sevenfold increase in the number of MENA migrants to the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Most of these migrants settled in the DMA, creating one of the largest current Arab ethnic enclaves outside of the MENA region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design, sample and recruitment</title><p id="Par15">The three participating schools in our study have an estimated combined enrollment of 2000 students, with the majority of students teachers and staff identifying as Arab.</p><p id="Par16">The primary research questions (RQs) are:

Data will be collected on students&#x02019; socio-demographics, public services usage, experiences prior to and following resettlement (if applicable), and psychosocial wellbeing. Due to the unique ethnic/racial composition of students at these high schools, researchers will utilize census sampling to ensure adequate sample sizes for each stratum (further described below). The research team will visit every Arabic class at each school to explain the study and distribute parental consent forms. Aside from students aged 18+ years, only students whose parents sign and return consent forms will be approached for assent on the day of data collection. Student assent will be obtained prior to the survey and students will be informed of their rights as participants. The survey was developed in English and translated into Arabic; both versions will be available to all students who participate. The research team will also work with the school offices to access records of student performance, such as academic grades and behavioral assessments. Several steps will be taken to protect participant privacy throughout data collection and analysis. The survey will be self-administered using a password-protected school computer. Completed surveys will automatically upload to a secure server that is accessible only by research staff and the local files will be erased from the device. Data files will be de-identified and indexed by a participant code assigned as part of the study to reduce the possibility that confidential information will be leaked beyond the intended research staff in the event that study instruments are lost or stolen.

Calculations were conducted assuming &#x003b1;&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, 80% power, and a one-to-one ratio of students in both sample groups. As a result, a total of 196 students (98 in each stratum) are required.</p><p id="Par35">Differences in the outcomes of interest between the two strata will be tested using a first-order linear regression; tests will be deemed significant at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. Multivariate linear regressions will then be employed to assess whether bivariate relationships between group membership and the outcomes of interest hold when controlling for other covariates, including various sociodemographic characteristics, measures of academic performance, and stressful life events. Lastly, effect modification will be assessed by examining whether any covariates deemed to be associated with the outcomes of interest in the previous step have a differential impact on the outcomes across the two strata. The significance of potential effect modifiers will be identified through the use of interacted linear regressions, where group membership is interacted with key covariates. Additional analyses will explore similar relationships between group membership and secondary outcomes around academic performance. All quantitative analyses will be conducted using Stata14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Qualitative assessment and analytic plan</title><p id="Par36">Qualitative data will be analyzed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis, allowing themes to emerge from the data inductively while using themes from previous studies with similar population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

While the challenges associated with migrating to a new country may influence the degree to which newcomer students are able to adapt to their new country, it is also important to understand how this adaptation process might differ for students whose families resettle within more insulated Arab enclaves. The unique ethno-cultural makeup of this study&#x02019;s setting will allow the findings to speak to the ethnic density effect and its correlation with mental health and psychosocial wellbeing among MENA adolescents residing in an ethnic enclave. The findings can also help to explore if and how the immigrant paradox pertains to this unique population, building on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. All findings will be shared directly with participating schools and organizations as well as through publication in peer-reviewed journals.</p><p id="Par38">There remains a dearth of evidence-based solutions for developing more inclusive policy and program development for refugees and forced migrants. We hope our findings will be used to inform interventions at the district, state, and national levels in high income countries to enable schools and their community partners to serve this population more effectively.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DMA</term><def><p id="Par4">Detroit Metropolitan Area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FGDs</term><def><p id="Par5">Focus Group Discussions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MENA</term><def><p id="Par6">Middle East and North Africa region</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful for the support from the school principals of all participating schools, Global Educational Excellence schools, and Qatar Foundation International (QFI).</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LS conceptualized and designed the study, made critical revisions to the manuscript, and gave final approval of the version to be published.
