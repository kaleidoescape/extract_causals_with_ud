We investigated whether neutrophil-derived microvesicles may influence arterial pathophysiology. Here we report that levels of circulating neutrophil microvesicles are enhanced by exposure to a&#x000a0;high fat diet, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis. Neutrophil microvesicles accumulate at disease-prone regions of arteries exposed to disturbed flow patterns, and promote vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis in a murine model. Using cultured endothelial cells exposed to disturbed flow, we demonstrate that neutrophil microvesicles promote inflammatory gene expression by delivering <italic>miR-155,</italic> enhancing NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Similarly, neutrophil microvesicles increase <italic>miR-155</italic> and enhance NF-&#x003ba;B at disease-prone sites of disturbed flow in vivo. Enhancement of atherosclerotic plaque formation and increase in macrophage content by neutrophil microvesicles is dependent on <italic>miR-155</italic>. We conclude that neutrophils contribute to vascular inflammation and atherogenesis through delivery of microvesicles carrying <italic>miR-155</italic> to disease-prone regions.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The role of neutrophils in the development of atherosclerosis has long been an enigma, with few neutrophils detected within the plaque.

Increased levels of circulating neutrophils exacerbate atherosclerotic plaque formation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and indirect evidence also links increased circulating leucocyte counts and infection with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, detection of neutrophils in lesions is rare, possibly due to their short life span, the rapid removal of senescent neutrophils by macrophages within the developing plaque, and/or the lack of a highly specific detection method (see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> for review). In order to address this paradox, we have investigated whether neutrophils exacerbate vascular inflammation through the release of pro-inflammatory microvesicles (MVs), thus influencing atherosclerotic plaque formation without entering the vessel wall.</p><p id="Par4">MVs are 0.1&#x02013;1&#x02009;&#x000b5;m vesicles released from the cell membrane in response to various stimuli or during apoptosis.

While MVs are present in healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, increased levels of leucocyte MVs have been observed in patients with sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, acute vasculitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and individuals with high risk of cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Advances in our understanding of extracellular vesicle function have led to the discovery of a novel mechanism by which cells can communicate with each other through the transfer of vesicle cargo, such as noncoding RNA (e.g. microRNA (miRNAs)), to target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMVs) have been detected in human atherosclerotic plaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> but their role in plaque progression has not been studied.</p><p id="Par5">Atherosclerotic plaque distribution is focal, with plaques developing at sites of disturbed flow, such as bifurcations, where adhesion molecules are highly expressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Disturbed flow generates shear stress (mechanical drag) that is low and oscillatory at atheroprone sites, whereas shear stress is high at atheroprotected sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Vascular inflammation is regulated by a number of transcription factors including the master regulator nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the expression of which is known to be enhanced in atheroprone regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and induced by disturbed flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

We used oscillatory shear stress (OSS) to model flow at atheroprone regions and high shear stress (HSS) to model the flow found at atheroprotected areas and human NMVs were added to the perfusion media for 2&#x02009;h after a 72&#x02009;h conditioning period. As with our in vivo data, we found that under flow conditions, more NMVs adhered to HCAEC that had been cultured under OSS compared to HSS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). As NMVs have previously been shown to adhere to endothelial cells via a CD18-dependent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, we confirmed the presence of adhesion molecules on the surface of NMVs as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). CD18 expression was detected on all NMVs regardless of the stimulus used to induce their release (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that the preferential adhesion to atheroprone regions may be due to alterations in endothelial expression of the CD18 counter-receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Indeed, HCAEC cultured under oscillatory flow expressed higher levels of ICAM-1 on their surface compared to cells exposed to high shear (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Consequently, pretreatment of HCAEC cultured under oscillatory shear stress with anti-ICAM-1 antibody significantly inhibited NMV adhesion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d, e</xref>) indicating the preferential adhesion of NMVs to HCAEC exposed to OSS was via an ICAM-1-dependent mechanism.

In vitro experiments showed that the presence of NMVs significantly enhanced monocyte adhesion to HCAEC under OSS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f, g</xref>). Furthermore, monocyte transendothelial migration toward CCL2 was increased in the presence of NMVs in a manner that was dependent on the number of NMV present (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). Crucially, NMVs released from unstimulated neutrophils were unable to induce this increase in monocyte transmigration (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>), suggesting that this response is dependent on the properties of NMVs released from stimulated neutrophils. The effect was, however, dependent on the presence of endothelial cells, as NMVs did not influence monocyte migration in the absence of HCAEC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). Pre-blocking CD18 on the surface of NMVs significantly reduced monocyte transendothelial migration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j</xref>). We noted that relatively few fluorescently labelled NMVs adhered to monocytes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>) and also NMVs did not activate monocytes (as demonstrated by a lack of L-selectin shedding and no induction of CD11b expression; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>). Thus we conclude that interaction of NMVs released from stimulated neutrophils with endothelial cells, via CD18 on the NMV surface, promotes the subsequent recruitment of monocytes, and that this process does not involve monocyte&#x02013;NMV interactions. Therefore, we next investigated whether NMVs promote monocyte recruitment by altering endothelial cell inflammatory activation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>NMVs induce inflammatory activation of HCAEC via RelA</title><p id="Par12">Given the central role of cytokines and adhesion molecules in monocyte recruitment, we investigated the effects of NMVs on endothelial expression of these inflammatory factors.

In addition, NMVs induced an increase of ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and CCL2 protein levels under static conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) in HCAEC.

Additionally, we found that modified LDL was able to induce the release of large numbers of MVs from neutrophils with high levels of microRNA, suggesting that dyslipidaemia may induce the increased levels of circulating MVs observed in both our human and murine studies. It is important to note that, despite the differences in the longevity of the different models used in the current study&#x02014;a short term increase in fat intake in healthy humans and a longer term high-fat diet in hypercholesterolemic mice - similar changes in plasma MVs were observed with the absolute number rather than the proportions of MVs changing. Our findings in healthy human subjects were mirrored in hypercholesterolemic mice and led to an increase of NMVs in vessel walls. Although levels of NMVs in the vessel wall increased over time, this could be due to accumulation of NMVs that are not degraded once internalised or, alternatively, it could be due to an increase in the rate of uptake due to exacerbation of local inflammation. The observations from our murine studies are in agreement with findings from Leroyer and colleagues who detected the presence of granulocyte-derived MVs in human atherosclerotic plaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Further studies into the role of NMVs in patients with cardiovascular disease will need to take into account the effects of current treatments such as statins on MV numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> as well as the effect of comorbidities such as diabetes, which is known to be correlated with increased circulating MVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. However, since our data clearly show a link between NMVs and atherosclerosis, this may warrant further investigation in a large cohort of well-characterised patients at risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p id="Par21">Atherosclerosis is a focal disease that occurs in regions of disturbed flow. NMV-endothelial cell interactions were increased when under conditions of disturbed flow and at atheroprone sites in mice fed on a high-fat diet. This correlated with the expression of <italic>ICAM-1</italic>, and adhesion was indeed found to be ICAM-1 dependent, similar to findings previously described investigating NMV interactions with HUVEC under static conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, interaction of NMVs from stimulated neutrophils with endothelial cells further increased <italic>ICAM-1</italic> expression suggesting that this interaction may lead to an augmentation of subsequent NMV-endothelial cell interactions (i.e. positive feedback). This could provide a mechanism by which NMVs accumulate in the vessel wall of mice on a high-fat diet over time. Once adherent, NMVs were internalised by endothelial cells. ICAM-1 was also required for the internalisation of NMVs and, interestingly, Muro et al. have described a pathway for endocytosis involving clustering of ICAM-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. It is plausible that NMVs utilise this pathway, providing a mechanism by which increased levels of internalisation occur in areas where there is increased expression of this adhesion molecule, such as atheroprone regions.

The mechanism involves BCL6, a negative regulator of NF-&#x003ba;B, whose expression in EC was suppressed by <italic>miR-155</italic> delivery. Thus, we suggest that NMVs enhance NF-&#x003ba;B expression in endothelial cells by delivering <italic>miR-155</italic>, which inhibits the negative regulator BCL6.

To address this hypothesis, we injected NMVs isolated from wild type or <italic>miR-155</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice into hypercholesterolemic mice and found that only those from wild type mice were able to enhance atherosclerotic plaque formation, demonstrating that NMV delivery of <italic>miR-155</italic> to atheroprone regions is crucial in this response. It should be noted that NMVs contain a complex mixture of proteins, RNAs, and miRNAs that may also contribute to atherosclerosis development and future studies should address the potential role of these factors. Nevertheless, despite this complex cargo, we have shown that <italic>miR-155</italic> is an important component and may be a potential therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.</p><p id="Par24">Together, our studies presented here provide fundamental insights into the mechanism of action of NMVs in enhancing vascular inflammation and monocyte recruitment to developing plaques, potentially solving a long-standing enigma regarding the role of neutrophils in atherosclerosis. The ability of NMVs to preferentially adhere to atheroprone sites and activate endothelial cells could be a major mechanism by which neutrophils contribute to plaque formation but are rarely detected in human plaques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par25">For human studies, experiments complied with all ethical regulations and were approved by the University of Sheffield Research Ethics Committee (reference SMBRER310) or the Loughborough University Ethical Subcommittee for Human Participants (Study title: Molecular and Hormonal Responses to Diet-Induced Insulin Resistance, Approval number: R13-P171).
