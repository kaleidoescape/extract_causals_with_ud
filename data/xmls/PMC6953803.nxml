This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Mg<sup>++</sup> supplementation in leg cramps treatment in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This observational clinical trial studied 132 pregnant women with leg cramps in the first trimester of pregnancy. At baseline, 74 (56.3%) had two leg cramps episodes per week, 28 (21.1%) three episodes, 13 (9.8%) four episodes and 9 (6.8%) five or more episodes. They were randomized 1:1 to 300 mg/day of oral Mg<sup>++</sup> citrate (n = 66) or placebo (n = 66). The primary outcome was the frequency of leg cramps episodes per week reported by pregnant women. Secondary outcomes were the ocurrence of leg cramps and oral magnesium side effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>130 pregnant women completed the study and the two groups were comparable according to some sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. After 4 weeks of intervention it was observed a 28.4% (39/132) (CI 95%: 20.9&#x02013;37.0) reduction of leg cramps in all participants and no difference between the two groups was found; reduction of 27.2% (18/66) (CI 95%: 17.0&#x02013;39.6) in Mg++ group and 32.8% (21/66) (CI 95%: 21.6&#x02013;45.7) in the placebo group. The OR of leg cramps was 1.3 (CI 95%: 0.6&#x02013;2.9), p = 0.527, taking the placebo group as reference. Among pregnant women who remained with leg cramps the mean of leg cramps episodes per week showed no significance difference between the Mg++ and placebo groups; t-student test: p = 0.408. Four pregnant women showed gastrointestinal side effects; 2 in each group had nauseas and diarrhoea.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy did not reduce the ocurrence and frequency of episodes of leg cramps.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://data.crossref.org/fundingdata/funder/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1107597</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010688</institution-id><institution>Instituto Nacional de Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia da Criosfera</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>401609-2013-8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9170-0808</contrib-id><name><surname>Alves</surname><given-names>Jo&#x000e3;o Guilherme B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funded by the Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1107597) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecn&#x000f3;logico, CNPq (401609-2013-8).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the mansucript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the mansucript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leg cramps are involuntary painful skeletal muscle contractions lasting from seconds to minutes, often nocturnal, and frequently involve the gastrocnemius [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. About 30&#x02013;50% of pregnant women experience leg cramps at least twice a week during the third trimester [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The etiology of cramps during pregnancy is unclear, but is believed to be due to overload of the ankle plantar flexors, excessive exercise, metabolic disorders, circulatory problems, underlying medical conditions, nutritional deficiencies (vitamins E and D) or electrolyte imbalances (eg. magnesium, calcium and sodium) [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Many therapies for leg cramps have been tried as gabapentin, pycnogenol, electrolytes and vitamins (magnesium, calcium, sodium, and vitamin E and vitamin D), massage, muscle stretching, relaxation, heat therapy and dorsiflexion of the foot [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, there are still no consistent conclusions for treating leg cramps in pregnancy. [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Magnesium plays an important role in many metabolic reactions, neuronal excitability and muscle function [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Magnesium deficiency enhances neuromuscular transmission. Magnesium therapy has been shown to be effective in eclampsia-related seizures [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For this reason some studies have suggested a beneficial role of magnesium in leg cramps. Even more because magnesium requirements increase during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Magnesium supplementation has been indicated as a therapy capable of minimizing fetal growth restrictions, reducing the risk of preeclampsia and favoring newborn weight gain, although there is no strong evidence of these benefits [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Besides insufficient magnesium intake is common, especially in low-income regions [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Some systematic reviews showed that is unclear whether oral magnesium provides an effective treatment for leg cramps and large well-conducted randomised controlled trials are needed to answer the question of leg cramps treatment [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227497.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227497.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227497.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is even more important for low-income regions where insufficient magnesium intake is common [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

This trial tests the hypothesis that oral magnesium supplementaton during pregnancy may reduce the frequency od leg cramps episodes. The intervention lasted 4 weeks and was completed between November 2015 and January 2018. This study was part of the Brazil MAGnesium trial [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT02032186).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The study took place at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Brazil. IMIP registers about 6,000 deliveries per year. Pregnant women who attended the antenatal care clinic at the Department of Obstetrics, IMIP, were invited to join this study. Inclusion criteria were pregnant women aging between 18&#x02013;45 years, gestational age between 12 and 20 weeks, a single gestation and currently residents of the city of Recife. Gestation age was based on the last menstrual period among women with a regular menstrual cycle or by first-trimester pregnancy dating ultrasound. Exclusion criteria were uncontrolled known hyperthyroidism, any type of known active parathyroid disease, chronic diarrheal disease, chronic kidney disease, defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL / min / 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, as determined by the initial assessment or by known history, Mg ++ serum concentration at baseline &#x0003e; 2.6 mg / dL.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Randomization and intervention</title><p>Randomization was performed in a 1:1 ratio using a table of random numbers, prepared by a researcher who did not participate in the data collection. These numbers were generated in a computer by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://random-allocation-software.software.informer.com/2.0/">Random Allocation Software&#x0202f;2.0</ext-link> program. Allocation concealment was ensured, as the referred researcher did not release the randomization code until the participants were recruited into the trial after all baseline measurements were completed.</p><p>Consenting pregnant women received a 4 weeks magnesium citrate capsule (300 mg elemental magnesium citrate per capsule) or a daily placebo capsule identical in colour and shape. Both capsules were manufactured by IMIP&#x02019;s Department of Pharmacology. The study medication packages were supplied with sequential numbers. Code break envelopes were supplied to the lead pharmacist but not available for the investigation team. Each pack was individually prescribed for each participant. Compliance, adverse events, and clinical intercurrences were monitored by the research team at routine prenatal visit during the intervention. Adherence to treatment was defined as the ingestion of at least 80% of the prescribed dose for 30 days.</p><p>The criteria for discontinuation of the study were: symptoms reported by the patient or clinical signals due to the intake of the magnesium capsules or the cancellation of prenatal care at IMIP.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the frequency of leg cramps which was defined as painful, involuntary contraction of muscles occurring at rest, mostly at night, and causing a palpable knot in the muscle, recorded at least twice a week. The frequency was measured as the number of leg cramps per week. Secondary outcomes were the presence of leg cramps episodes and oral magnesium side effects. All this informations were taken from the research diaries previously given to participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>All participants were informed about the data confidentiality, and were informed about their capacity to withdraw from the study. All pregnant women provided written informed consent.

It was assumed a 5% bilateral alpha error, a 80% power and an expected 35% percentage of cramps in the intervention group. With adjustments for a withdrawal rate of 10%, a minimum of 66 women in each group were required. Stata version 12.1 was used for statistical analysis. Chi-squared test for categorical variables and independent <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables were used when appropriate. It was considered a p &#x0003c; 0.05.

Oral magnesium treatment for leg cramps during pregnancy is still a controversial issue and only a few randomized controlled trials have accessed this intervention. Recently a Cochrane systematic review concluded that magnesium supplements did not consistently reduce how often women experienced leg cramps when compared with placebo [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Our results were similar with Nygaard et al [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This randomized controlled trial assessed the effect of two weeks of oral magnesium (360 mg) on leg cramps in 38 pregnant women. Leg cramp frequency and intensity were not influenced by oral magnesium supplementation.</p><p>However other studies showed different results. Dahle et al studied 73 women with pregnancy-related leg cramps in a randomized trial and oral magnesium for 3 weeks decreased leg cramp distress [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Supakatisant &#x00026; Phupong in a RCT studied 80 pregnant women for 4 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and observed a fifty per cent reduction of cramp frequency and intensity in the oral magnesium bisglycinate chelate group (300mg/day). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Zarean%20E%5BAuthor%5D&#x00026;cauthor=true&#x00026;cauthor_uid=28904937">Zarean</ext-link> &#x00026; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Tarjan%20A%5BAuthor%5D&#x00026;cauthor=true&#x00026;cauthor_uid=28904937">Tarjan</ext-link> verified that pregnant women with low magnesium level supllemented with magnesium (200 mg) had less leg cramps during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>These trials have different measurements. Pregnant women with different gestational ages were studied, interventions for variable periods of time (2 to 4 weeks) were used, different oral magnesium doses and oral formulations were administered. In addition, the definition of leg cramps was not well stablished in some studies. All this may explain different findings.</p><p>Gastrointestinal side effects were observed in a few women and there were no differences between the magnesium and placebo groups. The Cochrane systematic review concluded that there was no difference in the experience of side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The pregnant women in this study had a magnesium serum level in the minimum limit of normality (1.8 mg/dl) and around half of participants had hypomagnesemia. This seems to indicate that the pregnant women studied were at nutritional risk. The 300 mg daily dose of magnesium citrate used herein approximated that recommended in pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although magnesium deficiency has been implicated with an increased risk for gestational and adverse perinatal outcomes, there is not enough high-quality evidence to show that dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial. [<xref rid="pone.0227497.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227497.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227497.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Our study has strengths and limitation. Our strengths include: 1) A large number of participants and a very low rate of dropout; 2) Magnesium serum level was assessed; 3) Intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>The current sample size might not be sufficient for detecting the differences in the primary outcome, since they calculated it according to the frequency of leg cramp. Additionally, the 50% reduction in frequency of leg cramp in treatment group might be too positive. All these above might be the reasons why this study had a negative result. Other limitations are as follows: 1) The intensity of leg cramps pain was not evaluated. However this evaluation includes a high degreee of subjectivity; 2) Magnesium serum level was not assessed after intervention; 3) Pregnancy women were studied in the first trimester of pregnancy but leg cramps is a more common problem in the third trimester; 4) Because this study was observational, it could be prone to biases.</p><p>In conclusion, oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy did not reduce the ocurrence and frequency of episodes of leg cramps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227497.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Original clinical protocol in Portuguese.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227497.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227497.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227497.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227497.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Protocol English.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227497.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227497.s004"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227497.s004.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227497.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>Leg Cramps</article-title>. <source>BMJ Clin.

</p><p>Answers to the Reviewers:</p><p>Answer: Thank you very much for reviewing our manuscript. We also greatly appreciate the reviewers for their comments and suggestions. We have carried out all the recommendations suggested by the reviewers. The manuscript has been completely revised and we hope it will be able to be published. </p><p>Reviewer #1: I will focus on methods and reporting</p><p>Major</p><p>1) the introduction is very short for a research paper. Much more information is needed in terms of the background to the study.</p><p>Answer: The introduction was complemented. A new paragraph and five news references were added. </p><p>2) I don't understand how the sizes of the groups differ so much following an 1 to 1 allocation process</p><p>Answer: We apologize for this mistake. All the database was reviewed with a biostatistician and it was observed that eleven 18-year-old pregnant women had not been included in the analysis. These 11 pregnant women (2 in the intervention group and 9 in the control group) were now included in the analysis and the ratio 1:1 restored. </p><p>3) the methods section is very poor.

What is the odds ratio? the analysis plan is pretty poor. Even if perfectly balanced why did they not analyse in the context of a logistic regression, where the effects could be quantified in ORs?</p><p>Answer: Baseline level for cramps was included. The sample size calculation was based upon the 50% reduction in frequency of leg cramps in both groups obtained from Dahle et al (reference number 12) and Supakatisant C &#x00026; Phupong V (reference number 13) trials.

There are many critical design flaws for this study. The data provided in the manuscript was not consistent in whole manuscript. Also, many writing issues and language questions presented in the manuscript.</p><p>I will list several important design flaws:</p><p>1. The ratio for randomization was 1:1, while the number of women in Mg supplementation group was 57 and 64 in the placebo group. The number of participants in two groups were imbalanced. And the author did not provide the detailed allocation concealment for randomization. This is very important in a RCT study. Without allocation concealment, randomization would be unsuccessful.</p><p>Answer: We apologize for this mistake.

These 11 pregnant women (2 in the intervention group and 9 in the control group) were now included in the analysis and the ratio 1:1 restored. Allocation concealment was ensured, as the service did not release the randomization code until the participants were recruited into the trial after all baseline measurements were completed.</p><p>2. The sample size calculation was based on the estimation of 50% reduction in frequency of leg cramp in Mg treatment group. The primary outcome was the presence of the leg cramps.

This limitation was included in the discussion.</p><p>3. The method for missing values were not mentioned in the study.</p><p>Answer: Thank you for this observation. However as we had no missing values we did not include this in the methods section. </p><p>&#x02003;</p><p>Reviewer #3: 1. The hypothesis testing, power and type 1 error should be included in the study design section. Please also be clear whether the type 1 error is one-sided or two sided.</p><p>Answer: The hypothesis testing, power and type error were included in the methods section.</p><p>2. The screening failure rate is very high. Any reasons for this?</p><p>Answer: The flowchart was corrected. The main reason for the screening failure was absence of leg cramps. </p><p>&#x02003;</p><p>Reviewer #4: In this RCT, oral magnesium did not reduce the occurrence nor frequency of leg cramp episodes in the second trimester of pregnancy. This is an interesting topic, but some details are missing from this manuscript.</p><p>1.) The rationale for the trial requires more explanation in the introduction to highlight any gaps in knowledge. For example, the Garrison et al. (2012) systematic reviewed showed no evidence that oral Mg is helpful for leg cramps during pregnancy, with low heterogeneity among trials. What will this RCT add?</p><p>Answer: Garrison et al is cited in the introduction (reference number 11) and they final conclusions are that &#x0201c;It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed.&#x0201d; We studied pregnancy-associated cramps and our conclusion is the same of Garrison et al, i.e. it is unlikely that magnesium supplementation during pregnancy provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to leg-cramps. </p><p>This systematic review implications for research were: &#x0201c;To resolve the uncertainty surrounding the role of magnesium in pregnant women, parallel&#x02010;group blinded placebo&#x02010;controlled RCTs of magnesium in that population are needed&#x0201d;. We tried to develop a randomized double-blind controlled trial. </p><p>2.) In the introduction, it would be more relevant to cite magnesium effects on muscle/ mechanistic effects rather than cite general information on the etiology of cramps.</p><p>Answer: The introduction was complemented. A new paragraph and four news references were added. </p><p>3.) How common are cramps during the second trimester (study population used in the RCT)?</p><p>Answer: During the second trimester 70.0 % (91/130) of 130 participants that had leg cramps in the first trimester continued presenting leg cramps. </p><p>4.) pg. 5: Exclusion of those with Mg at baseline &#x0003e;9.5mmol/dL is not physiologically plausible given the Mg reference range. this value is a typo?</p><p>Answer: Thank you for this correction. It was a typo error and it was corrected (2.6 mg/dL)</p><p>5.) Was adherence self reported?</p><p>Answer: Compliance/adherence, adverse events, and clinical intercurrences were monitored by the research team at each routine prenatal visit until the completion of the treatment. Adherence was defined as the ingestion of at least 80% of the prescribed dose.</p><p>6.) How were outcomes ascertained?</p><p>Answer: All this informations were taken from the research diaries previously given to participants. </p><p>7.) Additional statistical rationale for the sample size calculation is needed. Why was a 50% reduction in leg cramps expected?</p><p>Answer: The sample size calculation was based upon the 50% reduction in frequency of leg cramps in both groups obtained from Dahle et al (reference number 12) and Supakatisant C &#x00026; Phupong V (reference number 13) studies.</p><p>8.) pg. 7: Lines 3-4: are units in mg/dL? Three serum levels are listed: should one be deleted?</p><p>Answer: The units are in mg/dL. It was provided. The first serum level was deleted. </p><p>9.) Provide information on whether any stopping rules were instituted (CONSORT missing item)</p><p>Answer: The criteria for discontinuation of the study were: clinical signs or symptoms reported by the patient due to the intake of the capsules or the cancellation of prenatal care at hospital. </p><p>10.) Who was blinded to the information? (eg. only participants, their doctors, the PI, those assessing outcomes, the statistical analyst, etc)?</p><p>Answer: Participants, their doctors and all investigators. This information was now provided in the method section. </p><p>11.) Table 1: income values are approximately $50,000 annually? Units need checking</p><p>Answer: Thank you for this observation. It was corrected. </p><p>12.) Flowchart (Fig 1): Indicate which arm is the placebo; which is the Mg arm (currently unlabeled)</p><p>Answer: It was indicated.</p><p>13.)

For example, in tbale 1, 36 in Mg group and 30 in placebo group were currently employed; while in total, 68 were currently employed. In table 2, 27,2 should be 27.2.

The registration refers to the Brazil MAGnesium trial, but neither the current study is referred to nor are the aims of the study defined as secondary outcomes. Therefore, the presented manuscript describes an unplanned secondary analysis of the above mentioned randomized trial Brazil MAGnesium trial. A secondary analysis should be regarded as an observational trial and should be identified explicitly as such.</p><p>The CONSORT checklist does not longer correspond to the presented study. The STROBE checklist would be more appropriate and will guide the authors to important aspects, which should be included in the description of the study. E.g. the consideration of potential confounders in the statistical analysis of observational data is necessary and should be added.</p><p>One further aspect is, that randomization corresponds to the estimated sample size (2000 assigned to magnesium, 1000 assigned to placebo (with 2:1 allocation ratio) according to protocol on ClinicalTrials.gov) and not to the subsample of 132 patients (with an apparent 1:1 allocation ratio). This means, that the quality characteristics of randomization no longer apply. The study is merely an observational trial.</p><p>The sample size of the initial study is based on the primary outcome (perinatal composite outcome). Therefore, the sample size and corresponding power is not adequate for the current outcome (presence of leg cramps) and puts the validity of the analysis and subsequent conclusion into question.</p><p>Apart from that, the &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; calculation is based on &#x0201c;50% reduction of leg cramps&#x0201d; and not on the variable defined as the primary endpoint (presence of leg cramps) so that the methodological basis of the study in itself is also questionable.</p><p>I am sorry to say, but from my point of view there are unsurmountable methodological deficits.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
