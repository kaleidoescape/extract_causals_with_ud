Previously, we have used adaptive laboratory evolution to enable biomass synthesis from CO<sub>2</sub> in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Genetic analysis of adapted clones from two independently evolving populations revealed distinct enrichment for insertion and deletion mutational events. Here, we follow these observations to show that mutations in the gene encoding for DNA topoisomerase I (<italic>topA</italic>) give rise to mutator phenotypes with characteristic mutational spectra. Using genetic assays and mutation accumulation lines, we find that point mutations in <italic>topA</italic> increase the rate of sequence deletion and duplication events. Interestingly, we observe that a single residue substitution (R168C) results in a high rate of head-to-tail (tandem) short sequence duplications, which are independent of existing sequence repeats. Finally, we show that the unique mutation spectrum of <italic>topA</italic> mutants enhances the emergence of antibiotic resistance in comparison to mismatch-repair (<italic>mutS</italic>) mutators, and leads to new resistance genotypes. Our findings highlight a potential link between the catalytic activity of topoisomerases and the fundamental question regarding the emergence of <italic>de novo</italic> tandem repeats, which are known modulators of bacterial evolution.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">European Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000781</named-content></funding-source><award-id>646827</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Israel Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003977</named-content></funding-source><award-id>740/16</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Human Frontier Science Program</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000854</named-content></funding-source><award-id>LT000546/2018-L</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In clonal microorganisms, spontaneous mutations in the DNA sequence are a dominant source of genetic variation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The rate and spectrum of mutational events are the outcome of extrinsic environmental conditions (e.g.&#x000a0;exposure to DNA damaging agents) and intrinsic cellular processes (e.g.&#x000a0;DNA replication fidelity). As natural selection acts on the genetic variation within a population, identifying mutagenic mechanisms is essential to understanding evolutionary outcomes, such as the emergence of antibiotic resistance (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Population genetic models suggest that under strong selective conditions, such as exposure to novel environmental stress, mutator strains with high mutation rates can persist in the evolving population (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Mutators, which have spontaneous mutation rates of up to three times that of the ancestral strain, are frequently observed in laboratory evolution experiments (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>). A high prevalence of mutator strains is also found in natural bacterial populations, for example, in clinical isolates of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and among pathogenic isolates of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The genetic basis of mutator strains is often traced to sequence variation that affects one of the cellular mechanisms related to DNA replication, repair, or maintenance. A partial list of mutator alleles includes the genes of the mismatch repair system, the oxidative lesion 8-oxodG system, and mutations affecting the proofreading capacity of DNA polymerases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). As the rate and spectrum of mutational events in mutator strains are shaped by the affected cellular mechanism (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), distinct mutational biases can affect the evolutionary dynamics of bacterial populations, as demonstrated in the case of antibiotic resistance (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported on the use of laboratory evolution in chemostats to adapt a metabolically engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> strain toward biomass synthesis from CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In two independent adaptive evolution experiments, we noticed distinct biases in the types of mutations that were fixed in the population. Specifically, in clones isolated from the first evolution experiment we found that &#x02248;85% of the detected mutations (28 out of 33 mutations) were short sequence deletions, with deletion lengths of one to four base pairs (bp) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In a second independent experiment, sequencing of adapted clones revealed that over 60% of the acquired mutations (14 out of 22 mutations) were base insertions. Notably, all of the insertion mutations were head-to-tail (tandem) sequence duplications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Tandem sequence duplication mutations are generally considered to arise from &#x02018;slippage&#x02019; replication events (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), however, the newly formed duplicated sequences were independent of existing sequence repeats. A detailed description regarding the adaptive laboratory evolution process and the characterization of the adapted strains has been previously reported (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate the genetic basis underlying the biased mutation spectra that were observed in these two laboratory evolution experiments, we used whole-genome sequencing to identify potential mutator genes in the adapted clones. We found that <italic>topA</italic>, encoding for DNA topoisomerase I, was independently mutated in both of the evolving populations. In clones isolated from the first evolution experiment, where short sequence deletions dominated the mutation spectrum, we identified a point mutation in <italic>topA</italic> (g104c) that leads to a nonsynonymous substitution of an arginine residue (R35P). In the second evolution experiment, where a high frequency of tandem sequence duplication was observed, we found a point mutation (c502t) that results in the nonsynonymous substitution of another arginine residue (R168C).</p><p>Topoisomerase I belongs to the ubiquitous family of 1A topoisomerases, and is known to relieve helical torsion in the chromosome by introducing transient single-strand breaks in the DNA backbone. Previous studies highlight the involvement of topoisomerases in maintaining genome stability, for example, by preventing the accumulation of DNA:RNA hybrid R-loops and the removal of DNA incorporated ribonucleotides (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Considering the key roles of topoisomerase I in maintaining genome stability, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the point mutations identified in the evolving populations give rise to mutator phenotypes with a highly biased mutational spectrum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Strains and genomic modifications</title><p>An <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 strain was used as the parental strain for all further genomic modifications. The adapted strains in which the R35P and R168C <italic>topA</italic> mutations were originally identified have been previously described (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For the construction of <italic>topA</italic> mutants (referred to in the text as strains R35P and R168C) in the background of the BW25113 strain, we used P1 transduction according to the following procedure. First, P1 lysate was prepared from the <italic>&#x00394;sohB780::kan</italic> Keio strain (JW1264-2, referred in the text as <italic>topA<sup>+</sup></italic> strain), in which a kanamycin resistance marker is located in proximity (&#x02248;1&#x000a0;kbp) to the <italic>topA</italic> locus. The lysate was used to transduce the strains containing <italic>topA</italic> mutations, and the transduced cells were plated on kanamycin supplemented LB plates (25 ug/ml). We used Sanger sequencing of the <italic>topA</italic> amplicons to screen for transduced clones in which the resistance marker has been introduced into the <italic>sohB</italic> locus without affecting the mutation in the adjacent <italic>topA</italic> gene. Positive clones, in which the resistance cassette and mutated <italic>topA</italic> locus have been genetically linked, were used as donor strains for a second round of P1 transduction into a BW25113 strain. The short distance between the resistance marker and the <italic>topA</italic> locus (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;kbp) in comparison to the large size (&#x02248;100&#x000a0;kbp) of the DNA fragment delivered to the recipient facilitated the allelic exchange of the mutated <italic>topA</italic> locus to the recipient BW25113 strain. Whole-genome-sequencing was used to validate the introduction of the mutated <italic>topA</italic> genes, along with the <italic>&#x00394;sohB780::kan</italic> marker, to an otherwise unperturbed genetic background in the BW25113 strain. The <italic>&#x00394;sohB780::kan</italic> Keio strain (JW1264-2), containing the native <italic>topA</italic> sequence, was used as a control strain in all of the genetic assays. <italic>sohB</italic> is a non-essential gene that encodes polypeptide S49 peptidase family protein. No phenotypes related to mutation rate and spectrum are associated with the <italic>&#x00394;sohB780::kan</italic> genotype. The strain referred to in the text as <italic>mutS</italic> is the <italic>&#x00394;mutS738::kan</italic> from the Keio collection (JW2703-2).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Drug resistance assays</title><p>All assays were performed in 96-well microplates. A single colony from each strain was inoculated into M9 minimal media supplemented with glycerol (2 g/l) as a carbon source and suitable antibiotics (kanamycin 25 ug/ml). Following overnight incubation (37&#x000b0;C, 220 RPM), the saturated culture was diluted to a concentration of &#x02248;10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml based on OD measurements, and 10 ul (&#x02248;10<sup>3</sup> cells) were inoculated into 150 ul of M9 minimal media supplemented with a limiting amount of glycerol (40 mg/l) to control the overall number of cell divisions. The culture was incubated for 24&#x02013;48 h, after which 5 ul drops from each well were plated on an M9 agar plate supplemented with glycerol (2 g/l) and the counter-selection drug. The assay was repeated twice, using either 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-galactose (DOG) at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich, D4407) or Azidothymidine (AZT) at a final concentration of 5 uM (1.3 ug/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, A2169) as the counter-selection drug. The agar plates were incubated for 48 h and resistant colonies were sampled to determine the resistance conferring mutation in each colony. Only a single colony was sampled from each culture to ensure the analysis of independent mutational events. For each sampled colony, we used PCR to amplify and sequence the known genes (<italic>galK</italic>/DOG and <italic>tdk</italic>/AZT) whose loss-of-function rendered the bacteria resistant to the drug. The resulting sequences were compared to the wild-type sequences of <italic>galK</italic> or <italic>tdk</italic> genes and mutations in the resistant colonies were annotated using Geneious software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com">http://www.geneious.com</ext-link>). Assays for <sc>d</sc>-cycloserine (DCS) resistance were performed as described above, with the following modifications: (a) LB media was used,&#x000a0;(b) DCS concentration was 133 ug/ml, (c) mutation calling was performed by the whole-genome-sequencing of resistant colonies as described below.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-3"><title>Mutation accumulation lines</title><p>For each strain, a glycerol stock was inoculated in LB media, incubated overnight, and streaked on an LB agar plate supplemented with kanamycin (25 ug/ml). Isogenic lines were established from a single, well isolated colony. Lines were propagated daily by streaking a random single colony from each line on LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin (25 ug/ml). The lines were maintained for 48 passages (&#x02248;1200 generations) for <italic>topA<sup>+</sup></italic> and R168C strains or 24 passages (&#x02248;600 generations) for strains R35P and R35P <italic>gyrA</italic>. As the growth rates of the different strains varied, different incubation times were needed to obtain comparable generations per passage rates, as determined by CFU counting of typical colonies (&#x02248;25 generations/passage). Freezer stocks were sampled from the founding strains and every 25 passages. Whole-genome sequencing was used to determine the mutations accumulated in the final clones, as detailed below. The mutation rate per genome replication was calculated for each mutation type based on the average number of mutations across all lines for each strain.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-4"><title>Whole-genome-sequencing and mutation calling</title><p>A single colony was inoculated in 3&#x000a0;ml of LB media with kanamycin (25 ug/ml) and incubated to saturation. The culture was harvested by centrifugation and genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Sequencing libraries were prepared using Nextera tagmentation reactions as described by Baym <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (2015). The final libraries were sequenced using HiSeq 2500 or NextSeq 500 sequencers (Illumina) to yield single reads with a typical coverage of &#x000d7;30 per sample. Demultiplex reads were mapped to the reference of <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 (CP009273.1) and mutations were called using breseq pipeline version 0.25 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We note that our analysis does not capture certain types of mutations, such as copy number variations.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-5"><title>Purification of recombinantly expressed TopA variants</title><p>His-tagged topoisomerase I proteins (R35P, R168C and wild-type) were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 transformed with the topoisomerase I encoding plasmid pCAN24-6xHis-TopA obtained from the ASKA library (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The R35P and R168C encoding mutations were introduced to the coding sequence of <italic>topA</italic> using PCR based site-directed-mutagenesis according to standard protocols. The resulting plasmids, pCAN24-6xHis-TopA:R35P and pCAN24-6xHis-TopA:R168C, were sequenced to validate the mutated sequence. For recombinant protein expression, a single colony of <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113&#x000a0;transformed either with the native or one of the mutated plasmids, was inoculated in 3 ml of LB media supplemented with chloramphenicol (34 ug/ml). Following overnight incubation (37&#x000b0;C, 220 RPM) the saturated culture was diluted 1:20 into 50 ml of fresh media. Protein over-expression was induced at the mid-exponential phase (&#x02248;0.5 OD) by the addition of IPTG (0.5&#x000a0;mM). The cells were harvested and the protein was purified using a His-Spin Protein Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following protein purification, we used an Amicon Ultra 30K centrifugal filter (Merck Millipore) to replace the elution buffer with the plasmid relaxation assay reaction buffer. Protein purity was validated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and GelCode Blue staining (Thermo Fisher). Purified protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-6"><title>Plasmid relaxation assay</title><p>Purified enzymes of the same concentrations were diluted serially and assayed for DNA relaxation activity in a final reaction volume of 10 ul with 40 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 ug/ml BSA, and 800 ng of supercoiled plasmid DNA (pNiv vector, as described in (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)). The vector sequence does not contain designated topoisomerase I cleavage sites. The reaction was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min, after which it was terminated by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1%. The DNA was electrophoresed in a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel with TAE buffer for 45 min at 135V. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide, washed twice in DDW for 1 h, and photographed under UV light. We estimated the relative activity according to the defined least quantity of the enzyme required for complete relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA under the given reaction conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="SEC3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="SEC3-1"><title>R35P and R168C topoisomerase I mutants show biased mutation spectra, enriched in sequence deletions and insertions</title><p>To explore the potential effect of topoisomerase I on the spectrum of mutational events, we genetically introduced the mutated <italic>topA</italic> alleles to an <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 genetic background (Materials and Methods). Whole-genome sequencing verified the replacement of the native <italic>topA</italic> gene with sequences encoding for either the R35P or the R168C mutated enzyme variants. In addition to the mutations introduced through allelic replacement, in the R35P strain we identified four mutations in genes unrelated to DNA processing which were most probably acquired during early handling of the strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In addition, we observed that mutations in <italic>gyrA</italic> or <italic>gyrB</italic> genes, with a positive fitness effect, often emerged in the R35P strain during continuous strain propagation. Compensatory mutations in gyrase genes can reduce the accumulation of DNA torsional stress, and were reported to be essential for the viability of <italic>topA</italic> null mutants (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Next, we quantified the spectrum of mutational events (i.e.&#x000a0;point mutations, insertions and deletions) in the <italic>topA</italic> mutant strains and in a <italic>topA<sup>+</sup></italic> strain using two independent drug resistance assays (Materials and Methods). As selection agents, we used 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-galactose (DOG), an inhibitor of galactokinase (encoded by <italic>galK)</italic>, and azidothymidine (AZT), an inhibitor of thymidine/deoxyuridine kinase (encoded by <italic>tdk</italic>). Both drugs inhibit the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> on minimal media via interactions with known molecular targets (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Briefly, we plated cells that were cultured in drug-free media on solid minimal media containing the toxic drug (either DOG or AZT) and a suitable carbon source (Materials and Methods). Resistant mutants that gave rise to colonies were isolated, and the resistance-conferring mutation in each colony was determined by sequencing the known drug target gene. To ensure the analysis of independent mutational events, only a single colony was sampled from every assay repeat.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>,&#x000a0;the sequencing of <italic>galK</italic>, which is the molecular target of DOG, revealed that resistant colonies arising from <italic>topA</italic> mutants exhibit significantly altered mutation spectrum in comparison to the <italic>topA<sup>+</sup></italic> strain (n = 24 for each strain, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). In colonies arising from the R168C mutant strain, we found that 50% of the resistance conferring mutations in <italic>galK</italic> were sequence insertions, composed entirely from <italic>de novo</italic> tandem duplications with lengths of 2&#x02013;19 bp. In the R35P mutant strain, we found that all of the resistance conferring mutations in <italic>galK</italic> were due to short sequence deletions, with lengths of 1&#x02013;7 bp. These results were in marked contrast with the point mutation dominated spectrum (&#x02248;66%) that was observed in resistant colonies arising from the <italic>topA</italic><italic>+</italic> strain. When we repeated the experiment using AZT as a selection drug, the results were in agreement with the values reported above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S3</xref>). In addition to the observed differences in the mutation spectra of <italic>topA</italic> mutants in comparison to the <italic>topA</italic><sup>+</sup> strain, we noted that both R35P and R168C mutants exhibited a strong localization pattern of mutations with well-defined hotspots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This contrasts with the uniform spatial distribution of mutations observed in the <italic>topA+</italic> strain, where mutations occurred across the <italic>galK</italic> coding sequence without noticeable hotspots. Similarly, a mutational hotspot was also observed in the <italic>topA</italic> mutants when AZT was used as a selection drug, where &#x02248;50% of the resistance conferring mutations were localized in a 20 bp region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Comprehensive sequence data for the mutations identified in this experiment can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>.

The methyl-directed mismatch repair system (MMR) is a major DNA repair pathway for correcting base-base mismatches or small insertion-deletion loops generated by replication errors. The MMR complex is capable of recognizing mismatch pairing, discriminating between the newly synthesized strand and the template, removing the mismatched base from the new strand, and correctly filling the gap through repair synthesis. <italic>E. coli</italic> with mutations affecting components of the mismatch repair system (e.g.&#x000a0;<italic>mutS</italic>), exhibit a strong mutator phenotype with over a 100-fold increase in the rate of point mutations. MMR deficient strains also show an increase in the frequency of insertion and deletion in comparison to the wild-type mutation rate;&#x000a0;however, these are mostly limited to the gain or loss of a single nucleotides in homopolymer runs, or the loss of di-/tri- nucleotide in microsatellite repeats (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This mutational pattern points towards the most common mechanism for the introduction of frameshift mutations, which are usually generated by polymerase slippage or unequal crossover during the replication of repeat sequences (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, here we show that mutations perturbing the relaxation activity of DNA topoisomerase I in <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x000a0;lead to mutator phenotypes with deletion and tandem-duplication enriched mutation spectra, which are independent of existing repeat sequences. As such, it is unlikely that these mutations arise from polymerase replication errors. Potential alternative sources of the mutagenesis observed in <italic>topA</italic> mutants may include the direct involvement of the enzyme, a secondary mechanism linked to the accumulation of torsional strain due to the impaired activity of mutants. Other models involving additional enzymes and processes are possible. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, disruption of <italic>topA</italic> leads to excessive negative supercoiling and the accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrid R-loops and the stabilization of non B-DNA forms (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). These non-canonical DNA structures are suggested to stimulate genetic instability, as was recently demonstrated by the accumulation of deletion, insertion and complex mutations following dCas9-induced R-loop formation in yeast (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This highlights the loss of DNA supercoiling homeostasis as a potential indirect mechanism for the mutator phenotype in <italic>topA</italic> strains. Alternatively, it is possible that failure to complete the catalytic cycle in the topoisomerase mutated enzymes directly leads to mutagenic events. Potential mechanisms of mutagenesis due to catalytic impairment include the formation of a stable cleavage complex leading to replication fork collapse, or through the introduction of single-strand DNA breaks. For example, it was recently demonstrated that the repair of adjacent single-strand breaks in plants can lead to the formation of tandem sequence duplications (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>An additional characteristic of the mutation spectrum observed in <italic>topA</italic> mutants is the localization of mutations in sequence hotspots, as observed in all three resistance assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Although we were not able to identify common sequence motifs in these regions, or high similarity to preferred known topoisomerase I cleavage sites, it is possible that the mutated enzymes exhibit sequence preference that is different from cleavage sites previously described for the wild-type enzyme. Alternatively, it is possible that an intrinsic feature of the sequence renders it more sensitive to the accumulation of excessive negative supercoiling or the formation of non-canonical DNA structures that can lead to mutagenic events. While our results unequivocally identify mutations in <italic>topA</italic> as the genetic basis of mutator phenotypes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, further studies are required to elucidate the molecular details underlying the difference in mutation rates and spectra between R35P and R168C <italic>topA</italic> mutants.</p><p>Fixation of <italic>topA</italic> mutants had been previously observed in multiple laboratory evolution experiments (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). For example, in a long-term evolution experiment in <italic>E. coli</italic>, mutations in <italic>topA</italic> with positive fitness effects emerged in multiple populations (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a <italic>topA</italic> mutator phenotype with an accelerated rate of tandem duplications in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Tandem sequence repeats are a well-documented source of genetic instability that plays a significant role in microbial evolution (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).
