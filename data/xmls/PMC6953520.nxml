Such definition was originally developed for research use, but it also became an intervention threshold for prevention of fragility fracture. Multiple studies have demonstrated that people who have a BMD T-score&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;&#x02212;2.5 have a greater risk of fragility fracture. However, it has also been shown that most fracture patients had a BMD T-score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;&#x02212;2.5 [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, development of fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) is important to consider important risk factors other than BMD.</p><p id="p0015">FRAX has been developed by professor Kanis based on data from nine population-based cohorts. Eight of these cohorts were comprised of Caucasians, except one which was derived from Japanese [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. After extensive validation in different populations, FRAX has been recognized as one of the most important tools for fracture risk prediction. FRAX was subsequently used to develop intervention threshold for initiating antiosteoporosis treatment. Such notion has helped to improve the poor sensitivity of BMD-based intervention threshold.</p><p id="p0020">As aforementioned, FRAX was developed based on risk factors identified mainly from Caucasian cohorts. It is unclear if FRAX is useful in making individualized treatment decisions, although FRAX has been recalibrated in many Asian regions using corresponding population-based data in their regions.</p><p id="p0025">In this issue, Lekamwasam [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reviewed the diversity of FRAX-based intervention thresholds in Asia, which summarized the basis and types (e.g., age-dependent, fixed, and hybrid) of intervention threshold in Asia. It was found that FRAX was not the only intervention threshold applied in some Asian regions (such as Vietnam and Malaysia), while some Asian regions only adopted the intervention threshold suggested by National Osteoporosis Foundation of USA instead of developing their own intervention threshold. Indeed, the hindrance of developing their own intervention threshold or calibrating FRAX could be due to the unavailability of cohorts in their own regions. Moreover, it has been shown that fracture prediction score developed by population-specific risk factors may outperform FRAX in predicting fracture [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In particular, some risk factors included in FRAX may be specific to Caucasians, which may not be applicable to Asians. Therefore, it is important to develop population-specific fracture prediction score instead of adopting a universal fracture prediction score. Likewise, it may be better to derive the intervention threshold from the population-specific prediction score. Nevertheless, FRAX could still be a justified choice if such population-specific fracture prediction score is not yet available.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0030">No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pasco</surname><given-names>J.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Seeman</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>M.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Merriman</surname><given-names>E.N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicholson</surname><given-names>G.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kotowicz</surname><given-names>M.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The population burden of fractures originates in women with osteopenia, not osteoporosis</article-title><source>Osteoporos Int</source><volume>17</volume><year>2006</year><fpage>1404</fpage><lpage>1409</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16699736</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kanis</surname><given-names>J.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Johansson</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>N.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>McCloskey</surname><given-names>E.V.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A brief history of FRAX</article-title><source>Arch Osteoporos</source><volume>13</volume><year>2018</year><fpage>118</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">30382424</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lekamwasam</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The diversity of Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX)-based intervention thresholds in Asia</article-title><source>Osteoporos Sarcopenia</source><volume>5</volume><year>2019</year><fpage>104</fpage><lpage>108</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>E.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bow</surname><given-names>C.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>C.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Soong</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeung</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Loong</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Discriminative value of FRAX for fracture prediction in a cohort of Chinese postmenopausal women</article-title><source>Osteoporos Int</source><volume>23</volume><year>2012</year><fpage>871</fpage><lpage>878</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21562875</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lam</surname><given-names>M.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sing</surname><given-names>C.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>G.H.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kung</surname><given-names>A.W.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>K.C.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>C.L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Development and validation of a risk score to predict the first hip fracture in the oldest old: a retrospective cohort study</article-title><source>J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci</source><year>2019 Jul 29</year><comment>[Epub]. pii: glz178</comment></element-citation></ref></ref-list><ack id="ack0010"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p><bold>ORCID:</bold> 0000-0002-6233-9144.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="d31e14"><p id="ntpara0010">Peer review under responsibility of The Korean Society of Osteoporosis.</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
