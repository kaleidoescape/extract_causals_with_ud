Approximately 70% of HCC patients suffer from metastasis and recurrence within 5 years after surgery in the residual liver after curative resection.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> But the mechanism of metastasis and recurrence of HCC was still unclear, which was the main cause for short-term survival and high fatality of HCC. Therefore, it is urgent to screen highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for the prediction of HCC prognosis and to in-depth investigate the metastasis/recurrence mechanisms.</p><p>Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) was an important prognostic factor and predictor for HCC metastasis and recurrence, which was a special type of HCC metastasis and caused by the invasion of HCC cells into the portal vein.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Early formation of PVTT was a key characteristic of HCC metastasis, but the aetiology of PVTT in HCC metastasis was largely unknown, so far. The clear explanation of PVTT formation under HCC metastasis was necessary to investigate the metastasis mechanisms. Up to now, there have been only two reports on the PVTT associated proteomics. One was performed on 20 pairs of HCC tissues with PVTT and without PVTT, and PDIA6 and ApoA-I were identified to be closely related to vascular invasion feature of HCC through two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The other also utilized two-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem MS to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins between a type of distinct PVTT (dPVTT) and parenchyma tumor (PT) tissues, and C-kit was identified to be useful as a potential marker to distinguish dPVTT from PT.<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Phosphorylation is one of the major types of PTMs in eukaryotic species.

But the phosphoproteomics of HCC with PVTT has not been reported, which plays a critical role in HCC metastasis.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to screen highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for the prediction of HCC prognosis and investigate the molecular signatures of the HCC with PVTT, by quantitatively comparing the overall phosphoproteome of the primary HCC tissues, surrounding non-cancerous tissues and PVTT tissues using iTRAQ coupling with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results would help us better understanding of the mechanisms of PVTT, which was essential to HCC metastasis and recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Sample Collection</title><p>Tissue samples, including the cancerous, surrounding non-cancerous and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) tissues were obtained from 6 primary HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombus, respectively.

Then, the samples were followed by tissue homogenization on ice and precipitated by ice-cold acetone. After centrifugation at 17,000 g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C, the supernatant was collected and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by BCA assay (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.

And the proteins were digested with trypsin via the FASP protocol with spin ultrafiltration units of molecular weight cut off 10,000 Dalton. Finally, the peptide mixture was further labeled using the iTRAQ reagent kit (AB SCIEX, USA) as follows: 3 groups (HCC group, Pan group and PVTT group) from one patient were labeled with 113, 114 and 115 isobaric tag, respectively; and the peptides from biological repetitions of above 3 groups from another one patient were labeled with 116, 117 and 118, respectively. In total, the iTRAQ 8-plex labeling was independently repeated 3 times, defining as A, B and C. And the mixed samples of 18 groups with equal amount were labeled with 119 in every 8-plex labeling, as an internal standard to balance each 8-plex labeling. The labeled peptides were mixed with equal amount in every 8-plex labeling and desalted with the Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridges and then dried in a vacuum centrifuge for further usage.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2003"><title>Phosphopeptides Enrichment</title><p>Magnetic Titanium Dioxide Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used to enrich the phosphopeptides.

In our phosphoproteomic results, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is upregulated 2.2-fold and 1.63-fold in the HCC group and PVTT group compared with Pan group. Therefore, significant upregulation of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 might increase the recurrence and metastasis during the progression of HCC pathology.

Although there has been a lot of research in this work, however, the role of phosphorylation of imbalance in HCC mechanism needs more in-depth excavation, and new treatments will largely depend on the interpretation and study of these protein phosphorylation status change. The omics data provided in this paper provide substantial data for further understanding of protein phosphorylation and HCC development mechanisms. Of course, due to the limitations of high-throughput screening based on mass spectrometry, the sample size used in this study is still small, so more detailed data analysis and validation is still needed.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we have applied the iTRAQ-based quantitative phosphoproteomic approach to investigate the molecular signatures of the HCC with PVTT by quantitatively comparing the overall phosphoproteome of the primary HCC tissues, surrounding non-cancerous tissues and PVTT tissues. The results showed that different protein phosphorylation profiles in primary HCC tissues, surrounding non-cancerous tissues and PVTT tissues might reveal different underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was elevated in HCC tissues and PVTT tissues comparing with surrounding non-cancerous tissues, it might be closely related to HCC recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, the high phosphorylation level of 4E-BP1 on Thr46 might serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis of early recurrence of HCC.
