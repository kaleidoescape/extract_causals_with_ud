In plants, it occurs in three sequence contexts: CG, CHG, and CHH (where H is A, T, or C). The latter does not allow direct inheritance of methylation during DNA replication due to lack of symmetry, and methylation must therefore be re-established every cell generation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously shown that <italic>CMT2</italic> and <italic>NRPE1</italic> are major determinants of genome-wide patterns of TE CHH methylation. Here we instead focus on CHH methylation of individual TEs and TE-families, allowing us to identify the pathways involved in CHH methylation simply from natural variation and confirm the associations by comparing them with mutant phenotypes. Methylation at TEs targeted by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway is unaffected by <italic>CMT2</italic> variation, but is strongly affected by variation at <italic>NRPE1</italic>, which is largely responsible for the longitudinal cline in this phenotype. In contrast, CMT2-targeted TEs are affected by both loci, which jointly explain 7.3% of the phenotypic variation (13.2% of total genetic effects). There is no longitudinal pattern for this phenotype, however, because the geographic patterns appear to compensate for each other in a pattern suggestive of stabilizing selection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>DNA methylation is a major component of transposon silencing, and essential for genomic integrity.

The majority of plant methylation is found in TEs, and there are three types of DNA methylation contexts: CG and CHG, both of which are symmetric, and CHH, which is not (H is A, T, or C). CG-methylation (mCG) and CHG-methylation (mCHG) can be maintained in a semi-conservative manner during DNA replication by <italic>DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1</italic> (<italic>MET1</italic>) and <italic>CHROMOMETHYLASE 3</italic> (<italic>CMT3</italic>), respectively, whereas CHH methylation (mCHH) must be re-established every cell generation, presumably by one of two <italic>de novo</italic> pathways, one involving <italic>CHROMOMETHYLASE 2</italic> (<italic>CMT2</italic>), the other RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) [<xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>CMT2</italic> preferentially methylates heterochromatic non-CG cytosines [<xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], while RdDM involves small RNAs that recruit <italic>DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2</italic> (<italic>DRM2</italic>) to target regions throughout the genome [<xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These pathways thus have separate target sites [<xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and establish the genome-wide DNA methylation landscape in combination with maintenance and de-methylation pathways.</p><p>Natural variation for DNA methylation, superficially similar to DNA sequence polymorphism, is abundant in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although much of this variation likely reflects local sequence variation (e.g. segregating TE insertions), recent studies have revealed that a substantial part of the variation is controlled by <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci with genome-wide effects [<xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1008492.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Understanding these <italic>trans</italic>-regulators is essential for understanding the genome-wide pattern of methylation variation, and could provide important clues to the function of DNA methylation.</p><p>The present study builds on previous results to comprehensively characterize <italic>trans</italic>-regulation of mCHH and its role in the striking geographic pattern for this phenotype. We achieve this by looking for genotype-phenotype associations at the level of individual TEs or TE families rather than genome-wide averages.

Previous studies used bulk levels of DNA methylation within the 1135 epigenomes to identify putative natural variation at NRPE1 and CMT2. This study refines this approach by using mCHH at individual transposons, which significantly improve the resolution to pinpoint candidate natural variants. Numerous known and novel loci were identified and using previously published DNA methylome data from a collection of 86 A. thaliana mutants, they demonstrated the causal nature of the NRPE1 and CMT2 natural variants. These results further bolster this refined method for detection of natural variants controlling DNA methylation. Two examples of accessions possessing natural weak alleles of NRPE1 and CMT2 were identified at much lower frequency than expected by chance indicating selection against this combination. Lastly, integrating climate data there is an intriguing correlation between NRPE1 alleles and longitude.</p><p>Overall, this study nicely demonstrates the importance of the selection of phenotypic data for using GWAS to identify the causal nature of natural variants. The comments below are minor and are intended to improve this already strong manuscript.</p><p>1. The use of &#x0201c;de novo&#x0201d; methylation should be clarified. In the introduction it is stated that CMT2 is a de novo methyltransferase where as CMT3 is a maintenance methyltransferase. However, both recognize H3K9me2 to target DNA methylation. Given this mechanism is shared why is one considered maintenance and the other de novo. The type of methylation produce is irrelevant to this question. The use of CHH by the field to indicate de novo is overdue for a redefinition, as the Slotkin Lab has nicely shown, true de novo methylation is rare. Once true de novo methylation occurs at a region that previously was unmethylated all of the pathways, including RdDM ensue in maintenance methylation. This is important to this study due to the title and the opening introductory paragraph.</p><p>2. Line 13, CMT2 only binds H3K9me3 in vitro. As far as I know there is no known H3K9me3 in A. thaliana. And the one study that does report it is due to a antibody cross reaction with H3K36me3.</p><p>3. Figure 1&#x02014;I think it is counterintuitive to display the methylation reduction the way that it is presented for drm1/drm2 and cmt2&#x02014;it would be helpful if it was written under the key that you are showing percent reduction of methylation and what it is relative to.</p><p>4. Why is the pattern of correlation for differential CHH levels between cmt2/CMT2a&#x02019; and cmt2/CMT2b&#x02019; opposite?</p><p>5. Figure 5&#x02014;Why is cmt2a&#x02019; / NRPE1ref methylation on cmt2 loci relatively high, but cmt2a&#x02019; / NRPE1&#x02019; and cmt2ref / NRPE1&#x02019; show about the same level of methylation on these loci</p><p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript presents a GWAS study of trans-regulation of Arabidopsis CHH methylation, based on 1001 Epigenomes data. It focuses on methylation of individual TEs and TE families, instead of genome averages (which were done by previous studies). The authors claim that this new analysis approach refined previous GWAS results and established causal relationship of the phenotype and CMT2 and NRPE1 alleles. In doing so, the authors also took advantage of the previously published methylome data from various Arabidopsis mutants and correlate with natural alleles. This analysis also identified several new associations; however, no further investigations were done. I think the results on CMT2 and NRPE1 are pretty convincing. I have a minor comment on Figure 5A. It is obvious that CMT2b&#x02019; is insignificant on mCHH levels of RdDM targets, while with NRPE1ref (orange and green lines basically overlap in Figure 5A top left panel and the authors also provided p value). However, it seems that CMT2b&#x02019; has lower methylation than CMT2ref or CMT2a&#x02019;, while in NRPE1&#x02019; background (dark blue line vs. light blue and magenta lines). Moreover, although the authors say cmt2 knock-out is similar to CMT2b&#x02019;, Figure 5A top right panel suggests that there is clear difference between reference and cmt2. In order to claim statistical significance or insignificance, p values of these pair-wise comparisons should be provided. In the case of AGO1, based on Figure S7, the effect of ago1 mutant on methylation is rather small. On line 125, did the authors mean to say the allelic effects are too small or the mutant effects are too small? The problem with this interpretation is that the ago1 mutant methylation data from Stroud et al Cell 2013 (which the authors of this study used according to Materials and Methods) is obtained from ago1-27, which is a hypomorphic, not a loss-of-function, allele (according to Morel et al Plant Cell 2002). True null or loss-of-function alleles of ago1 are lethal. In additional, there could be functional redundancy of other Agos that can compensate for reduction of ago1&#x02019;s function in DNA methylation. Therefore, I would suggest the authors revise the part on ago1, or it will be misleading. Besides the concerns I raised above, the manuscript is well written and of interest to the plant epigenetic field.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Have all data underlying the figures and results presented in the manuscript been provided?</bold></p><p>Large-scale datasets should be made available via a public repository as described in the <italic>PLOS Genetics</italic>
