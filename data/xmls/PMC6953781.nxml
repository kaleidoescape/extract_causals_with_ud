Despite increased prevalence, breast cancer death rates have decreased by 36% from 1989 to 2012 due to screening and improved treatment regimens [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The use of ultrasound in screening, particularly in women younger than 45 years of age with fibroglandular, dense tissue, has improved cancer detection sensitivity in comparison to mammography alone [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The ability of ultrasound to detect small (&#x0003c; 1 cm), mammographically occult lesions [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] as well as potentially downgrading breast masses [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] provide examples of how ultrasound can further guide clinical decision making in cancer screening and detection.</p><p>The clinical utility of diagnostic modalities that provide more than just an assessment of malignant versus benign, but rather prognostic information has driven the development of transcriptome-based tests. The OncotypeDX&#x000ae; (Genomic Health Inc, Redwood City, CA) test calculates a recurrence score on a scale from 0&#x02013;100 (higher scores reflect higher risks of recurrence) for early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, in order to assess the potential benefit from chemotherapy after breast cancer surgery (7). This test is currently included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines. The MammaPrint&#x000ae; (Agendia Inc, Irvine, CA) test calculates a binary (high versus low) recurrence risk score based upon a 70-gene expression profile, and also guides chemotherapy treatment decisions [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226634.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In patients with an OncotypeDX&#x000ae; score less than 11 or a MammaPrint&#x000ae; low-risk score, chemotherapy can be omitted, and anti-estrogen therapy can be administered alone.</p><p>The development of the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] by the American College of Radiology (ACR) to include standardized language and descriptors in the reporting of breast imaging has proven very successful in standardizing communication among radiologists, oncologists, and surgical oncologists in the decision-making and management of breast lesions [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other fields have successfully developed similar approaches in prostate, lung, and liver lesions (PI-RADS, Lung-RADS, LI-RADS) [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Although BI-RADS has an established role in breast imaging and interdisciplinary communication (e.g. medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, and internists), with the ongoing development of new treatments and and genomic-based tests, we need to be able to derive as much information as possible from clinical imaging measurements [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226634.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The BI-RADS categorization of sonographic findings has sufficient positive predictive value to be used as a predictor of malignancy [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Along a parallel track, correlations between cross-sectional imaging and molecular profiling have identified potential surrogate roles as imaging biomarkers in a variety of diseases, including breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The clinically established use of ultrasound BI-RADS reporting affords an opportunity to assess how much information can be derived from imaging alone, and whether various descriptors may supplement prognostic gene panels. We sought to assess the potential of breast ultrasound feature descriptors to identify cohorts that would or would not benefit from chemotherapy using structured natural language processing (NLP) of BI-RADS terminology targeting established transcriptomic assays (OncotypeDX&#x000ae; and MammaPrint&#x000ae;).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This retrospective study received approval with waiver of written patient consent, from the Institutional Review Board at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA, and is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant. All data were fully anonymized for subsequent study analyses.</p><p>Patient demographics, histological classification of biopsied samples, receptor status (when available), and transcriptomic-test were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Breast cancer patients were included in this study if they had undergone testing with either of the two genomic assays (OncotypeDX&#x000ae; and MammaPrint&#x000ae;) between April 2008 and January 2013, and were divided into two cohorts depending on which assay was performed. Ultrasound reports for each patient at the time of initial cancer diagnosis were stored in a collection of Microsoft Word&#x000ae; documents (.docx).</p><p>The diagnostic ultrasound studies, interpreted and reported by fellowship trained, board-certified breast radiologists (each with at least 4 years experience), with strict adherence to BI-RADS standards [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], were parsed with custom scripts focusing on BI-RADS descriptive terminology. Four classes of ultrasound BI-RADS field descriptors were consistently reported across all reports, accounting for the features that were most consistently described: margins, echogenicity, internal echo pattern, and retrotumoral phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Twenty-fold cross-validation was performed with a minimum of 10 observations per splitting-node and a minimum of 6 observations per terminal node. We defined an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to be at least 0.9 in order to be considered as a candidate classifier to potentially compete with molecular tissue markers and an AUC of 0.6 to be a reportable but not competitive as an radiogenomic surrogate.

Through the use of specific terminology and a well-defined vocabulary with systematic report recommendations, ultrasound BI-RADS has been an effective mechanism to provide consistent, transparent, and unambiguous recommendations to referring physicians and their patients to interpret the results of breast imaging studies (14). The use of a structured language and well-defined vocabulary is particularly useful since one challenge with respect to quantitative imaging of breast ultrasound is the non-tomographic, operator dependent nature of image acquisition, resulting in variation in acquisition with respect to anatomic planes as well as ultrasound parameters (e.g. different transducer probes, use of harmonics, differences in gain and time gain compensation, focal zones, etc). These sources of variation limit the application of automated or semi-automated quantitative imaging approaches to ultrasound. However, the BI-RADS descriptions of sonographically detectable masses provide an opportunity to use NLP based methods in order to identify features with prognostic and therapeutic implications and correlates with other diagnostic tests, such as the transcriptomic tests evaluated in this study.</p><p>The assessments of ultrasound imaging correlates using standardized language and descriptors compared to their relationship to the FDA approved tissue-based transcriptomic tests (OncotypeDX&#x000ae; and MammaPrint&#x000ae;) provide a biological context to interpret the transcriptomic measurements. For example, hypoechoic masses are concerning for malignancy, and it is such a common observation, that there is no further prognostic information to be derived from it, thus although it is an important BI-RADS feature, it is not an important prognostic predictor (since the ROC curves in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226634.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226634.g002">2</xref> implicitly assume <italic>a priori</italic> that the masses are hypoechoic). Conversely the CARTs enable evaluation of multiple features that portend higher or lower risk in which one feature may be more suspicious for malignancy but another feature is not (e.g. irregular margins but no retrotumoral phenomena, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226634.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226634.g002">2</xref>).</p><sec id="sec012"><title>Added value without added costs</title><p>The search for imaging correlates of transcriptomic tests can be classified to serve as non-invasive 1) alternatives, 2) complementary, or 3) supplementary roles to more invasive, biopsy-dependent tests. Many radiogenomic applications focus on the first point, which is beneficial when an imaging test is less expensive or cheaper than a tissue-based test. For example, recently MRI has been explored as a radiogenomic surrogate for some of these tests. Unfortunately classification of the breast MRI features do not achieve an accuracy that can reasonably compete or provide surrogacy for the established transcriptomic tests [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226634.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally the cost of MRI scans are non-trivial and rival the MammaPrint&#x000ae; and OncotypeDX&#x000ae; test costs (doubling the cost without providing substantive additional information). However, the ultrasound-based assessments used in this study was focused on the latter the second and third classifications (complementary or supplementary to tissue-based tests).</p><p>Although the role of OncotypeDX&#x000ae; and MammaPrint&#x000ae; in management of breast cancer have been promising, there is a non-negligible cost for these tests, in the $3000-$4000 range. Recent evidence suggests that this may not be cost effective [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], thus it would be beneficial to have a low- or no-cost non-invasive screening test, to determine whether there would be added value from these tests. In a similar vein, the cost of bilateral breast MRI is on average $3000, nearly ten-fold the cost of breast ultrasound [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226634.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast, part of the established diagnostic evaluation of breast masses involves the breast ultrasound, so there is no additional cost burden. Given the invasive nature of tissue-based tests and the costs associated with tissue biopsies, processing and analysis, in addition to the costs of commercial tests [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the use of ultrasound imaging information to help identify cases in which transcriptomic tests may alter patient management, provides a potential means to make the transcriptomic tests more cost effective.</p><p>The principle limitations of this study include the sample size, the number of available features, and the lack of quantitative measurements. The difference in the sample size between the two cohorts may in part explain why the performance of the OncotypeDX&#x000ae; predictor exceeded the MammaPrint&#x000ae; predictor and highlights the point that, with larger sample sizes and prospective evaluation at different hospitals, classification performance may improve. Although both tests provide guidance for treatment (i.e. low scores for both tests can justify sole anti-estrogen treatment), the MammaPrint&#x000ae; test is applicable to estrogen receptor positive and negative women, whereas the Oncotype&#x000ae; test has been applied demonstrated to estrogen positive cohorts. The difference in the clinical applications may also provide an explanation for the difference in the performance of the ultrasound feature descriptors. For example, &#x02018;internal echoes&#x02019; may not have any predictive significance in estrogen positive women, although testing this in an independent cohort is warranted before drawing such a conclusion.</p><p>Despite the aforementioned limitations, the AUC of the ROC curves for the regression decision trees suggest that there is a role for the use of ultrasound BI-RADS descriptors beyond just a probability assessment for malignancy versus benignity. Incorporation of additional features such as color Doppler flow and ultrasound contrast agents may also further improve the molecular predictive value of breast mass sonography. Furthermore, new contrast agents [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] may provide further improvements in the specificity of the classifier, providing more precise diagnostic and prognostic value. Future studies may also evaluate other genomic tests, such as the Breast Cancer Index, EndoPredict, Mammostrat, and Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay, for any potential correlation with imaging studies as well [<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0226634.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although BI-RADS was developed to guide decision making in breast imaging studies and to assess the probability of malignancy, the use of a standardized lexicon and descriptive features for ultrasound masses provided the opportunity to use NLP to construct regression trees classifiers for prognostic FDA approved transcriptome-based tissue tests. Using the structured language of ultrasound BI-RADS, we assessed the ability of ultrasound feature characteristics to predict OncotypeDX&#x000ae; and MammaPrint&#x000ae; transcriptome-based classifications across 219 patients. Interestingly, NLP classifications of the BI-RADS reports were able to generate classification trees that were concordant with the transcriptomic tests. Ultrasound findings, notably the &#x02018;retrotumoral&#x02019; and &#x02018;margins&#x02019; features, if abnormal, may help provide justification to obtain one of the transcriptomic tests; future multi-institutional prospective studies will be important in determining if these observations persist in larger cohorts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226634.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Table of imaging features, IHC, race, age, and OncotypeDX&#x000ae; scores.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226634.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226634.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Table of imaging features, IHC, race, age, and MammaPrint&#x000ae; scores.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226634.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226634.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of correlation between OncotypeDX&#x000ae; and IHC markers.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226634.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226634.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of correlation between MammaPrint&#x000ae; and IHC markers.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226634.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>NLP</term><def><p>natural language processing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BI-RADS</term><def><p>Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>area under the curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROC</term><def><p>receiver operator characteristic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CART</term><def><p>curve, classification and regression trees</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0226634.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.))</collab>, <collab>National Center for Health Statistics (U.S.)</collab>, <collab>National Cancer Institute (U.S.).

I think this will be a valuable manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This is an interesting look at the breast US features, as they correlate with breast cancer prognostic and predictive markers. It is nicely presented. However, I do take issue with the determination, under the method section, that " AUC of 0.6 to be considered as a supportive adjunct to help guide the decision of whether a molecular based tissue test is warranted"(page 37). I am not sure how this conclusion was reached, since this is not a study assessing the need for employing a prognostic marker, but rather a study looking at correlating a prognostic marker with imaging features. The decision on when to use a prognostic marker resides with the oncologist and is influenced by many patient and tumor characteristics and I do not believe it can be made on imaging features alone, at this point in time.</p><p>The conclusion that the US features employed here can be used to predict when to use a prognostic marker is, therefore, far reaching and should be revised.</p><p>What this study demonstrates is a correlation between the US features and Oncotype DX and, to a lesser degree, to the MammaPrint, but the correlation is moderate at best. Therefore, it can not be used in place of these tests to predict who needs chemotherapy.</p><p>The study is promising in that it shows a correlation and I agree with the conclusion that adding other imaging features to the ones evaluated in this study may improve the AUC and hopefully achieve the &#x0003e;0.9 AUC.</p><p>The Discussion is very lengthy, as mentioned by another reviewer. I would consider moving some of the discussion under the introduction part, for example the costs of MRI and prognostic markers and focus the discussion on the findings of this study and how it compares to other studies, like you did under the Conclusion section.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
