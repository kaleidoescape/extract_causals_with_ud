However, in a conventional microscopy setup, an objective lens can only be moved until it is in contact with a coverslip, which restricts the maximum focusing depth into a cleared tissue specimen. Until now, it is still a fact that the working distance of a high magnification objective lens with a high numerical aperture is always about 100 &#x003bc;m. In this study, a polymer thin film (also called as nanosheet) composed of fluoropolymer with a thickness of 130 nm, less than one-thousandth that of a 170 &#x003bc;m thick coverslip, is employed to replace the coverslip. Owing to its excellent characteristics, such as high optical transparency, mechanical robustness, chemical resistance, and water retention ability, nanosheet is uniquely capable of providing a coverslip-free imaging. By wrapping the tissue specimen with a nanosheet, an extra distance of 170 &#x003bc;m for the movement of objective lens is obtained. Results show an equivalently high resolution imaging can be obtained if a homogenous refractive index between immersion liquid and mounting media is adjusted. This method will facilitate a variety of imaging tasks with off-the-shelf high magnification objectives.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15H05953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nemoto</surname><given-names>Tomomi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18H04744</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8811-9377</contrib-id><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Yosuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19dm0207078h0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nemoto</surname><given-names>Tomomi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19dm0207087h0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8811-9377</contrib-id><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Yosuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>20173007, 20183007, 20193005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8811-9377</contrib-id><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Yosuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>2014&#x02013;2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8811-9377</contrib-id><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Yosuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by FY2017, FY2018 and FY2019 Cooperative Research Program of &#x0201c;Network Joint Research Center for Materials and Devices&#x0201d; (20173007, 20183007, 20193005) from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mext.go.jp/en/">http://www.mext.go.jp/en/</ext-link>), Japan (YO, TN and HZ), MEXT/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/">https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/</ext-link>) KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP15H05953 &#x0201c;Resonance Bio&#x0201d; (TN) and JP18H04744 &#x0201c;Resonance Bio&#x0201d; (YO), &#x0201c;Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies (Brain/MINDS)&#x0201d; Project from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amed.go.jp/en/">https://www.amed.go.jp/en/</ext-link>) 19dm0207078h0001 (TN) and 19dm0207087h0001 (YO), and a MEXT&#x02010;Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities 2014&#x02013;2018 (YO).

Recently, a number of optical clearing agents that make tissues transparent have been developed, which ultimately allows tissue imaging to reach a deeper position [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In order to obtain exquisite structural information of tissues, such as neurons, a high magnification objective lens with a high numerical aperture (NA) is an essential component for imaging. However, the working distance (WD) of such a high resolving objective is always as short as about 100 &#x003bc;m, which determines the maximum focusing depth. For deep tissue imaging, while the tissue clearing technique provides a promising solution from the specimen aspect, it remains a practical challenge due to the restriction from the objectives aspect.</p><p>Almost all the biological objectives are designed for a 170 &#x003bc;m thickness coverslip. For high magnification objectives (60&#x000d7; and 100&#x000d7;), liquid immersion lens, especially oil-immersion, is commonly used to obtain a higher resolving power, where the high refractive index (RI) of oil (RI: 1.515) compared to that of air (RI: 1.000) gives a higher NA of objectives. In this setup, an objective lens immersing in oil is located under the tissue behind a glass coverslip, where the lens can only be moved until it is in contact with the coverslip. The distance between the top lens of the objective and the surface of coverslip is known as WD; it roughly describes the maximum depth of the nominal focal plane that one can observe into a tissue specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227650.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Here, we postulate that if the coverslip can be removed from the optical path, an extra distance for the movement of an objective lens would be obtained, and a deeper tissue imaging with a conventional setup and off-the-shelf objectives could be possible.</p><fig id="pone.0227650.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227650.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Schematics of coverslip method and nanosheet wrapping mount.</title><p>(A) In a conventional coverslip method, an objective lens can only be moved until it is in contact with the coverslip. WD, working distance of an objective lens; NFP, nominal focal plane. (B) If the coverslip is replaced by a polymer nanosheet with a thickness of around 100 nm, an extra distance of 170 &#x003bc;m for the movement of an objective lens is obtained, namely a deeper maximum NFP can be expected.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0227650.g001"/></fig><p>The absence of a coverslip when using an inverted microscopy seems impossible as it will cause the specimen falling onto the objective lens or at least a damaging exposure to the atmosphere or immersion liquids. In previous studies, we have developed a nanosheet wrapping method to address the issues of specimen shrinkage and movement in tissue and cell imaging [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227650.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The term nanosheet refers to a transparent polymer thin film with a thickness of around 100 nm, less than one-thousandth that of a coverslip. Inspired by the use of plastic food wraps in our daily life, nanosheets have shown their capability to wrap various biological tissues. In this paper, we propose a nanosheet wrapping-assisted coverslip-free imaging method, where the tissue specimens are observed behind a polymer nanosheet, instead of a glass coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227650.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Fabrication of nanosheets</title><p>Silicon substrates (100) deposited with a 200 nm thermally grown silicon oxide layer (KST World Co., Japan) were cut to a size of 35&#x000d7;35 mm<sup>2</sup> and treated with a piranha solution (1:3 (v/v) mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid).

Alternatively, the RI of the immersion liquid can be adjusted to that of the specimen to produce a space-invariant PSF. Here, we choose 2,2&#x02019;-thiodiethanol (TDE) as an immersion liquid for the objective lens, which can provide a wide RI range from 1.333 to 1.515 by mixing with water [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227650.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

The difference in RI from that of the designed objective immersion oil produces aberration, which has been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. After a 3D deconvolution processing with the measured PSF using a commercial or an open-source software [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227650.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the imaging quality is much improved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227650.s007">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>).

Correction collar is most equipped on high magnification objectives (always for dry and water-immersion objectives) to correct the spherical aberration induced by variation of coverslip thickness and RI mismatch. It is known that even variation of a few micrometers in coverslip thickness can impact in the image quality, especially for high NA objectives [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In fact, as the typical coverslip has a RI of 1.515 similar to that of immersion oil, the correction collar on oil-immersion objectives is likely more relevant to address the problem of RI mismatch from specimen aspect. Our results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227650.s004">S3 Fig</xref> also show that if a homogenous RI is adjusted, the spatial resolution keeps constant even lack of a coverslip in the optical path. For objectives with other immersion liquids, correction collar plays a more important role in correcting the coverslip thickness variation, typically between 0.13 and 0.22 mm. We compare the spatial resolution between conventional coverslip setup and nanosheet wrapping mount by imaging a specimen with RI of 1.333 using a 60&#x000d7; water-immersion objective lens, which shows that the imaging quality of nanosheet wrapping much deteriorates compared to that of coverslip setup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227650.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). It is reasonable to expect such a result as the water-immersion objective lens is designed based on the assumption that a 170 &#x003bc;m thick coverslip is in the optical path. Taken together, the present nanosheet wrapping method is extremely feasible for oil-immersion objectives without too much concern about correction collar. For other immersions, one has to choose no coverslip (NCG) objectives, water dipping objectives, or setting the correction collar to 0 to account for the lack of a coverslip, if possible.</p><p>The space-variant aberration can be restored by some deblurring algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], corrected by adaptive optics techniques [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227650.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], or reduced by use of objectives with a motorized correction collar. However, as we indicated above, to adjust RIs homogeneously is a straightforward and effective method to obtain deep tissue imaging with nanosheet wrapping a cleared tissue specimen. In addition, in a routine imaging task, the mounting media gradually evaporates from the surface of tissue, leading to a subtle gradient in its RI and impairing the imaging quality [<xref rid="pone.0227650.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. With nanosheet wrapping, owing to the hydrophobicity of CYTOP, we find about 60% of water inside the tissue can be protected from evaporation even after 24 h, which suggests that the nanosheet wrapped tissue can be kept fresh for a longer time and so avoid RI inhomogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227650.s009">S8 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, a coverslip-free imaging method is developed by use of polymer nanosheet wrapping to increase the maximum focusing depth into a cleared tissue specimen.

While the method proposed in this study was tested with a confocal fluorescence microscopy only, we anticipate that a combination with the existing super-resolution microscopy techniques will further broaden its applicability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227650.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Protocol for nanosheet wrapping-assisted coverslip-free tissue imaging.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227650.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227650.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Thickness of prepared CYTOP nanosheets.</title><p>Correlation between the thickness of CYTOP nanosheet and the concentration of coating solution (<italic>n</italic> = 9).
