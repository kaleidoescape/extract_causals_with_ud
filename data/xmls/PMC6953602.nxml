It is used for many diverse applications, from genetically engineering cells to drug- and DNA-based vaccine delivery. Despite this broad utility, the high cost of electroporators can keep this approach out of reach for many budget-conscious laboratories. To address this need, we develop a simple, inexpensive, and handheld electroporator inspired by and derived from a common household piezoelectric stove lighter. The proposed "ElectroPen" device can cost as little as 23 cents (US dollars) to manufacture, is portable (weighs 13 g and requires no electricity), can be easily fabricated using 3D printing, and delivers repeatable exponentially decaying pulses of about 2,000 V in 5 ms. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration by genetically transforming plasmids into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells, showing transformation efficiency comparable to commercial devices, but at a fraction of the cost. We also demonstrate the potential for rapid dissemination of this approach, with multiple research groups across the globe validating the ease of construction and functionality of our device, supporting the potential for democratization of science through frugal tools. Thus, the simplicity, accessibility, and affordability of our device holds potential for making modern synthetic biology accessible in high school, community, and resource-poor laboratories.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>This Community Page article describes an ultra-low&#x02013;cost (23-cent) 3D-printed electroporator, inspired by a common barbecue lighter, designed to enable broader access to synthetic biology in high-school, community, and budget-conscious laboratories.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MSB acknowledges funding support through the National Science Foundation (award no. 1817334) and Mindlin Foundation (grant no.

Examples of these applications range from simple bacterial transformation [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and eukaryotic transfection to more complex tasks, including genetic engineering with CRISPR [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], gene transfer into mammalian embryos [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], cancer treatments using electrochemotherapy [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], transdermal drug delivery [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and gene-based vaccine delivery [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite these broad biological applications, commercial electroporators are complex and expensive pieces of bulky hardware that can cost thousands of dollars [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Their high cost places them out of reach for budget-restrained laboratories such as public high schools and research laboratories in resource-poor regions.</p><p>The need for accessible and affordable electroporators has previously prompted researchers to develop simple electronic circuits using relays and capacitors to amplify the voltage output required for electroporation [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, many of these devices are still expensive and require extensive electronic components and hardware skills to construct, making them impractical for wide adoption. Beyond conventional power sources (batteries, etc.), piezoelectricity has been recognized as an alternative option to generate the large voltage pulses required and has been successfully applied to immunize mice [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Inspired by and building on the early success of piezoelectric-based electroporation, we set out to develop a simple, easy-to-fabricate, and low-cost electroporator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Cognizant that commercial conducting cuvettes to hold liquid samples can often be a cost barrier, we also provide a simple method to build inexpensive millifluidic channels, using glass slides (or acrylic) with aluminum (or copper) tape, that can be used in place of cuvettes.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Design and fabrication of ElectroPen</title><p>The design of the ElectroPen includes a 3D-printed cylindrical chamber that houses a piezoelectric crystal harvested from a commercial lighter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>).

The device is operated simply by pressing down the toggle to trigger the piezoelectric mechanism, resulting in electrical discharge. (b) Design of the alternative electroporation millifluidic channel. The millifluidic channel design consists of two blocks (shown here in acrylic) covered with aluminum tape to act as electrodes and placed on a base with a gap distance of 0.1 cm. The millifluidic channel can be built out of other materials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) as an alternative for industrial equivalents. (c) Depiction of the origin of the piezoelectric ignition mechanism found within the common stove lighter. The inset is the striker/piezoelectric mechanism of the lighter. The region with the red cap consists of a metal housing encasing the piezoelectric crystal. The middle black region consists of the spring&#x02013;latch mechanism that strikes the crystal. The bottom black region (rightmost) consists of a wedge that is the origin for user-applied force and triggers the spring mechanism. The toggle on a lighter directly exerts a force on this mechanism to produce a spark. (d) Illustration of the general protocol for using the ElectroPen system. The cellular suspension is added to the gap in the millifluidic channel, after which the ElectroPen is connected and pressed to trigger a voltage potential. The cell suspension is then recovered in Luria Bertani broth and plated. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s015">S1 Video</xref> for a detailed demonstration.

The ElectroPen exploits a simple and inexpensive mechanical spring-latch mechanism to release a small hammer-pin structure onto the piezoelectric crystal to generate high voltages, rather than the complex electrical circuits with costly microprocessor-controlled relays that commercial electroporators use to generate similar voltages. This spring-latch mechanism was consistent across almost 20 lighters from different commercially available brands that we disassembled and inspected. To illustrate the underlying mechanics, we recorded the rapid motion of the piezoelectric crystal using a high-speed camera at 1,057 frames per second (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s018">S4 Video</xref>). The mechanism consists of two springs, a hammer (metal piece striking the crystal), and the PZT crystal itself connected to a metal conductor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). The hammer action functions in 3 phases: a loading phase, latch-release phase, and a relaxation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g003">Fig 3C&#x02013;3E</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio.3000589.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000589.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Spring-latch mechanisms for repeatable generation of high-voltage pulses.</title><p>(a) (i) Image of the striking mechanism (hammer action) found within the piezo igniter in a lighter (arrow indicates location of crystal).

The presence of two springs is to decouple the loading and release phase for consistent voltage output. (b) Images of the hammer and PZT crystal. The circular surface area of the hammer comes into direct contact with a pin that strikes the piezoelectric crystal, generating a voltage through the piezoelectric effect. (c) (i) Snapshots from high-speed video illustrating the position of the hammer during the loading, latch-release, and relaxation phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s018">S4 Video</xref>).

(d) Plot of displacement of the hammer and the lower case as a function of time obtained using high-speed image video. (e&#x02013;g) Zooming into the dynamics of the hammer during the latch-release phase reveals that the hammer achieves a peak velocity of 8 ms<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 0.5 ms, which corresponds to an acceleration of 30,000 ms<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. The explosive acceleration results in a 10-N force (mass of hammer is 0.3 g) exerted over a tiny area of the PZT crystal. The data for d&#x02013;g can be found on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bhamla-lab/ElectroPen-PlosBiology-2019">GitHub</ext-link> under the S2 Data file, under the sheets titled Fig 3D, 3E and 3F and 3G, respectively. PZT, lead zirconate titanate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.3000589.g003"/></fig><p>During the loading phase, the hammer is held in a locked position by a mechanical latch as the lower spring and upper spring are being compressed. This phase generates spring potential energy by compressing both springs through the user-exerted force on the 3D-printed hand toggle. As the compression continues, the wedge-shaped piece of the casing forces the pin of the hammer to rotate outwards of the latch. Once the pin of the hammer has reached a critical point in its rotation, i.e., it is no longer held in place by the latch, the lower spring instantaneously decompresses. This act converts the stored spring energy into the kinetic energy of the hammer, resulting in a high impact force on the cylindrical face of the PZT crystal to generate voltage. Since the degree of lower spring compression is dependent only on the spring&#x02013;latch design, the quantity of force striking the crystal by the hammer is independent of the user-applied force on the toggle. As a result, the output voltages are remarkably consistent. In the relaxation phase, the user releases the user-applied force to reset the hammer to its initial position.</p><p>Analysis of high-speed videos of the hammer releasing indicates that the hammer is able to reach a maximum velocity of 8 m/s at a peak acceleration of almost 30,000 ms<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, a force equivalent to 3,000 g-force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g003">Fig 3E&#x02013;3G</xref>). Through the explosive nature of the hammer action's acceleration, a powerful resultant impulsive force of 10 N strikes the PZT crystal, resulting in a high-voltage pulse. Using this value of force and parameters of the PZT crystal, we can theoretically predict the voltage output as <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>th</italic></sub> = 2.7 kV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s020">S2 Text</xref>), which is on the same order of magnitude as the experimentally measured voltages shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g002">Fig 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Transformation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> using ElectroPen</title><p>To demonstrate the utility of the ElectroPen in enabling bacterial electrotransformations, we prepare <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (BL21 strain) electrocompetent cells and transform them with a recombinant plasmid with superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) expression under the control of a constitutive promoter (J23119 from the Parts Registry; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s019">S1 Text</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).

A new push towards frugal science has inspired the development of many low-cost and open source scientific devices [<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000589.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that allow expansion of these disciplines into high schools, underfunded laboratories, and even field research. These low-cost devices serve as alternatives for expensive lab equipment while simultaneously removing numerous barriers even beyond cost, including access to electricity and portability. Here, we have theoretically modeled and experimentally validated the functionality and effectiveness of the ElectroPen, the cheapest electroporator in the world (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s021">S1 Table</xref>). A key component of the electroporator is a piezoelectric crystal that can be obtained from common stove lighters that can be easily purchased in most parts of the world (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). While the ElectroPen serves as a suitable alternative for commercial electroporators, a device at this cost comes with a few disadvantages that we outline below.</p><p>The first involves variability in the piezoelectric crystals found in lighters, both from batch to batch and different brands. Peak voltages (<italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub>) and time constants (<italic>&#x003c4;</italic>) are dependent on the type of crystal material, the dopants utilized, and the company from which it was purchased, which we demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>, and therefore, not every lighter crystal is suitable for electroporation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. In fact, we are currently unable to obtain more crystals with the same parameters as the crystals used for all the transformation experiments described here (from Handi lighters, manufactured by Fayco Industries) because of this variability in characteristic parameters. Other lighters from many different brands that we bought from other stores (Walmart, Amazon, Target) did not provide the required combination of voltages and time constants. For example, the Ozark Trail A shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g002">Fig 2B</xref> produces a time constant of 5 ms but a peak voltage of 5 kV, making it unsuitable for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformation. For other users, we recommend that they first test the crystal they obtain from a lighter using the protocol described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s019">S1 Text</xref> to quantify the pulse produced by the crystal to ascertain whether it is suitable for their specific biological system. The second is that the piezoelectric crystals have a limited life span. The life span of the crystal is based on the number of times the crystal is hit; however, this can vary between sellers because of the dopants used in the piezoelectric crystal. Typically, the crystal life is mentioned on the front or back cover of purchased lighters. Third, no optical indicator exists on our setup to indicate that a pulse was generated and applied to the sample during the trial. Successful electroporation was determined by evaluating growth of bacteria on an antibiotic resistance plate, which takes time. Thus, it can become challenging to quickly debug unsuccessful pulse transmission caused by either user error or instrument malfunction until after cells are cultured. One possible solution is to connect a light-emitting diode (LED) light in parallel to the conductive path for electroporation, serving as a visual indicator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s014">S14 Fig</xref>) for passage of the pulse through the cell suspension. Fourth, an improper contact between the ElectroPen wires and the millifluidic electrodes can prevent establishment of the electric potential necessary for successful transformation. To minimize these contact mismatch errors between the conductive surface and improve user friendliness, hardwired connections can be employed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000589.g004">Fig 4D</xref>.</p><p>Despite these minor shortcomings, which we hope to address in future iterations, our work directly opens up avenues for hands-on biology experiments in high schools and budget-conscious laboratories. Ultimately, the ElectroPen is another example in frugal science that serves to bypass economic and infrastructure limitations in the advancement of scientific research by the next generation of young scientists across the globe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec007"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.3000589.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Advantages and disadvantages of ElectroPen.</title><p>Workflow schematic for usage and applications of the ElectroPen in comparison to commercial electroporators, as well as their advantages and drawbacks.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.3000589.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.3000589.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Illustration of the assembly of the ElectroPen.</title><p>This depiction indicates the overall construction process with a tutorial found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s016">S2 Video</xref>.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.3000589.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.3000589.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Illustration of the assembly of the ElectroPen cuvette.</title><p>This depiction indicates the overall construction process with a tutorial found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000589.s016">S2 Video</xref>.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.3000589.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.3000589.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Size comparison between the ElectroPen and commercial electroporator.</title><p>(a) Difference in size and weight between the ElectroPen and Bio-Rad MicroPulser.

The hammer then returns to the original position as the user pulls back on the hammer action, restoring the original position.</p><p>(MOV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.3000589.s018.mov"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.3000589.s019"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Materials and methods.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.3000589.s019.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.3000589.s020"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Discussion of theoretical predication of voltage from piezoelectric crystals.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.3000589.s020.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.3000589.s021"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Comparison between standard commercial electroporators and the ElectroPen.</title><p>The listed electroporators reflect common equipment utilized in labs.
