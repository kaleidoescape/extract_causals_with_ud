The microRNA-33b (miR-33b), a member of miR-33 family, is reported to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. Notably, miR-33 was predicted to target CROCC based on microarray-based analysis. Hereby, we aimed to characterize the effect of miR-33b on epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GBC and the potential mechanism involved with the regulation of CROCC. In GBC cell lines, miR-33b expressed at low levels, and CROCC expressed at high levels, with enhanced EMT process. To further examine the specific mechanism of miR-33b and CROCC in GBC, the GBC cells were treated with the miR-33b mimic/inhibitor or siRNA-CROCC to assess the expression alteration of EMT-related genes and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MiR-33b was verified to target and down-regulate the expression of CROCC. The miR-33b up-regulation or CROCC silencing was observed to increase the level of E-cadherin but decrease the levels of N-cadherin and Vimentin, corresponding to impeded cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT, and tumor growth. The findings suggest that miR-33b up-regulation hinders GBC development through down-regulating CROCC, which was achieved by inhibition of EMT. The present study may provide an insight on a novel target for GBC treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CROCC</kwd><kwd>Epithelial-mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>Gallbladder cancer</kwd><kwd>Invasion</kwd><kwd>microRNA-33b</kwd><kwd>Proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most prevalent type of metastatic carcinoma in the biliary tract, accounting for 80&#x02013;95% of clinically diagnosed biliary tract cancers worldwide and is acknowledged as the sixth most common type of cancer among gastrointestinal cancers [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With comprehensive advancements in diagnosis and therapy, the 5-year survival rate for GBC has been persistently low, at about 13&#x02013;30% [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For patients with incidental GBC, the average survival time is 26.5 months, with a shorter overall survival of about 9.2 months for patients with suspected GBC [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The major risk factors for GBC incorporate gallstones, progressing age, female gender, anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal junction, certain ethnic groups, and geographic influence [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In spite of the advancements in treatment modalities for GBC such as surgical intervention, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy over the decades, the 5-year survival rate of patients with GBC remains low [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, it is pivotal to investigate the molecular mechanisms of GBC to improve treatment modalities and prolong the survival time of GBC patients [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Reports have illustrated the functionality of microRNAs (miRs) in diverse biological and cellular development of many severe diseases including GBC [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For instance, miR-26a was poorly expressed in GBC, and hence it could serve as a potential marker for early prognosis and treatment of GBC patients [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, miR-33b, which belongs to the miR-33 family, is an intronic miR encoded within the sterol response element binding protein 1 (SERBP-1) gene [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Particularly, up-regulated miR-33b has been reported to exert its tumor suppressive properties for inhibiting lung squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation and migration <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, miR-33b was also found to be down-regulated in primary tumor samples and osteosarcoma cell lines, which flagged the potential of an overexpression of miR-33b to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in osteosarcoma [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, the biological prediction by the RNA22 database demonstrated the ability of miR-33b to specifically bind to the ciliary rootlet coiled coil protein (CROCC), which was also ascertained in our experimentation. CROCC is also known as ROLT or TAX1 Binding Protein 2 (TAX1BP2) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Tax is a transcriptional activator, which evidently influences cell signaling through modulation of the CRE, &#x003ba;B, and SRE pathways and on the expression of various cytokines and proto-oncogenes, which leads to excessive centrosome duplication by targeting a specific centrosomal protein, TAX1BP2 [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Reports have flagged the functionality of CROCC with vital roles in tumors and involvement in the expression of cytokines and cancer-related genes. The aforementioned evidences led to a hypothesis that miR-33b and CROCC may be potentially involved in the development of GBC. Therefore, the present study was planned to explore the effect of miR-33b on GBC and its mechanism involving CROCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Dual luciferase reporter gene assay</title><p>The GBC-related miRNA microarray database GSE104165 was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) and the database with GBC tissues (<italic>n</italic> = 40) and adjacent normal tissues (<italic>n</italic> = 8) were then subjected to differential expression analysis with |log2FC| &#x0003e; 1, <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05 as threshold.

The CROCC 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032;UTR) gene fragments were synthesized and introduced to the pGL 3-control (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) using the endonuclease sites XhoI and BamHI, respectively. Complementary sequence mutation site of the seed sequence was designed on the wide type (WT) CROCC. The target fragment was inserted into the pGL3-control vector using T4 DNA ligase after utilizing restrictive endonuclease. The sequence confirmed that the luciferase reporter plasmids WT and mutant type (MUT) were co-transfected with the miR-33b mimic respectively into HEK-293T cells (Shanghai Institute of Life Sciences, Shanghai Academy of Sciences Cell Resource Center, Shanghai, China). After 48 h, the cells were collected and lysed.

RT-qPCR was performed in order to detect the level of miR-33b in the normal gallbladder epithelial cell line (HGBEC) and the four GBC cell lines (QBC939, SGC-996, NOZ, and GBC-SD). The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) indicated that miR-33b presented with low levels in all four GBC cell lines compared with those in the normal gallbladder epithelial cells.

The aberrant expression of certain miRs has been demonstrated to be functionally involved in GBC progression through regulation of various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Herein, our study investigated the effect of miR-33b on the regulation of EMT in GBC cells. Consequently, our findings illustrated that up-regulation of miR-33b could potentially suppress cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in GBC through down-regulation of CROCC.</p><p>In the initial experiment, the GBC cell lines presented with down-regulated expression of miR-33b. Furthermore, reports have documented miR-33b to be down-regulated in patients with high-risk genetic abnormality and associates with poor prognosis in multiple myeloma (MM) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, Tian et al. also flagged the presence of a low expression of miR-33b in MM, which confirmed the functionality of miR-33b as a tumor-suppressor in MM cells [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, miR-33b was speculated to serve as a prognostic marker for cancer progression [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, a recent study revealed that miR-125b-5p was down-regulated in GBC [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The findings from following experiments illustrated CROCC as a target gene of miR-33b, with miR-33b accounting for significantly elevated expression of E-cadherin but decreased levels of CROCC, N-cadherin, and Vimentin. These findings were in consistency with the result of dual luciferase report gene assay. Studies have demonstrated the vital functionality of EMT during cancer development as well as in GBC progression, with its deregulation facilitating tumor metastasis [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. E-cadherin and Vimentin are considered as principal biomarkers of EMT; however, E-cadherin is commonly disoriented along the progression of EMT [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A former study demonstrated a correlation of loss of E-cadherin expression with promoted invasive capacity and high tumor grade and poor prognosis [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, restoration of miR-33b expression inhibited lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and tumor cell EMT <italic>in vitro</italic>, which conformed to a previous study supporting the functionality of an altered miR expression to be vital in cancer metastasis [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Besides, a recent research observed similar results demonstrating that the overexpression of miR-30a enhanced E-cadherin expression but reduced the levels of N-cadherin and Vimentin [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Our study also demonstrated that miR-33b could suppress various cellular processes such as invasion, migration, proliferation, EMT, and tumor growth of GBC through down-regulating the expression of CROCC. In consistency with our study, Wu et al. also observed that the overexpression of miR-33b suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Also, an enforced expression of miR-33b resulted in its inhibitory effects on EMT in lung cancer cells [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study also revealed the potential of miR-33b to serve as an anti-metastatic miR, with overexpressed miR-33b greatly inhibiting cell proliferation in lung squamous cell cancer [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In consistency with our results, reports have observed miR-33b to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. CROCC has also been demonstrated to be of critical functionality with dual motives in regulating both tumorigenicity and aberrant centrosome duplication [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, the miR-33b has also been identified to function as a suppressive miR in breast cancer progression by inhibiting the stemness and metastasis of breast cancer cells [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A current study suggested that overexpression of miR-33b due to its tumor suppressive properties inhibited osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion by targeting the c-Myc gene [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, overexpression of miR-1 and miR-145 could potentially inhibit GBC cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> by decreasing cell proliferation and suppressing colony formation or clonogenic survival, which was in accordance with our results [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>To conclude, our findings demonstrated that miR-33b could inhibit GBC proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT through down-regulating CROCC. Our findings aid in the speculation of miR-33b to serve as a cancer suppressor in GBC and a potential therapeutic target for GBC treatment. In future studies, a larger vivo experiment should be conducted to further determine the underlying mechanism of miR-33b in GBC.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would also like to thank all participants enrolled in the present study.</p></ack><sec id="sec5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Ethical Statements</title><p>Animal experiments are performed in accordance with the principles of the Ethics Committee of Laboratory Animals in Jiangxi Cancer Hospital (Approval No. 201805002).
